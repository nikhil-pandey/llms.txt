## Animation

The easiest way to make a live animation in Matplotlib is to use one of the <span class="title-ref">Animation</span> classes.

<div class="seealso">

\- \[animations\](\#animations)

</div>

<div class="inheritance-diagram" data-parts="1">

matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation matplotlib.animation.ArtistAnimation

</div>

<div class="autosummary" data-toctree="_as_gen" data-nosignatures="">

Animation FuncAnimation ArtistAnimation

</div>

In both cases it is critical to keep a reference to the instance object. The animation is advanced by a timer (typically from the host GUI framework) which the <span class="title-ref">Animation</span> object holds the only reference to. If you do not hold a reference to the <span class="title-ref">Animation</span> object, it (and hence the timers) will be garbage collected which will stop the animation.

To save an animation use <span class="title-ref">Animation.save</span>, <span class="title-ref">Animation.to\_html5\_video</span>, or <span class="title-ref">Animation.to\_jshtml</span>.

See \[ani\_writer\_classes\](\#ani\_writer\_classes) below for details about what movie formats are supported.

### `FuncAnimation`

The inner workings of <span class="title-ref">FuncAnimation</span> is more-or-less:

    for d in frames:
        artists = func(d, *fargs)
        fig.canvas.draw_idle()
        fig.canvas.start_event_loop(interval)

with details to handle 'blitting' (to dramatically improve the live performance), to be non-blocking, not repeatedly start/stop the GUI event loop, handle repeats, multiple animated axes, and easily save the animation to a movie file.

'Blitting' is a [standard technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bit_blit) in computer graphics. The general gist is to take an existing bit map (in our case a mostly rasterized figure) and then 'blit' one more artist on top. Thus, by managing a saved 'clean' bitmap, we can only re-draw the few artists that are changing at each frame and possibly save significant amounts of time. When we use blitting (by passing `blit=True`), the core loop of <span class="title-ref">FuncAnimation</span> gets a bit more complicated:

    ax = fig.gca()
    
    def update_blit(artists):
        fig.canvas.restore_region(bg_cache)
        for a in artists:
            a.axes.draw_artist(a)
    
        ax.figure.canvas.blit(ax.bbox)
    
    artists = init_func()
    
    for a in artists:
       a.set_animated(True)
    
    fig.canvas.draw()
    bg_cache = fig.canvas.copy_from_bbox(ax.bbox)
    
    for f in frames:
        artists = func(f, *fargs)
        update_blit(artists)
        fig.canvas.start_event_loop(interval)

This is of course leaving out many details (such as updating the background when the figure is resized or fully re-drawn). However, this hopefully minimalist example gives a sense of how `init_func` and `func` are used inside of <span class="title-ref">FuncAnimation</span> and the theory of how 'blitting' works.

\> **Note** \> The zorder of artists is not taken into account when 'blitting' because the 'blitted' artists are always drawn on top.

The expected signature on `func` and `init_func` is very simple to keep <span class="title-ref">FuncAnimation</span> out of your book keeping and plotting logic, but this means that the callable objects you pass in must know what artists they should be working on. There are several approaches to handling this, of varying complexity and encapsulation. The simplest approach, which works quite well in the case of a script, is to define the artist at a global scope and let Python sort things out. For example:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    xdata, ydata = [], []
    ln, = ax.plot([], [], 'ro')
    
    def init():
        ax.set_xlim(0, 2*np.pi)
        ax.set_ylim(-1, 1)
        return ln,
    
    def update(frame):
        xdata.append(frame)
        ydata.append(np.sin(frame))
        ln.set_data(xdata, ydata)
        return ln,
    
    ani = FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 128),
                        init_func=init, blit=True)
    plt.show()

The second method is to use <span class="title-ref">functools.partial</span> to pass arguments to the function:

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation
    from functools import partial
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line1, = ax.plot([], [], 'ro')
    
    def init():
        ax.set_xlim(0, 2*np.pi)
        ax.set_ylim(-1, 1)
        return line1,
    
    def update(frame, ln, x, y):
        x.append(frame)
        y.append(np.sin(frame))
        ln.set_data(x, y)
        return ln,
    
    ani = FuncAnimation(
        fig, partial(update, ln=line1, x=[], y=[]),
        frames=np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 128),
        init_func=init, blit=True)
    
    plt.show()

A third method is to use closures to build up the required artists and functions. A fourth method is to create a class.

## Writer Classes

<div class="inheritance-diagram" data-top-classes="matplotlib.animation.AbstractMovieWriter" data-parts="1">

matplotlib.animation.FFMpegFileWriter matplotlib.animation.FFMpegWriter matplotlib.animation.ImageMagickFileWriter matplotlib.animation.ImageMagickWriter matplotlib.animation.PillowWriter matplotlib.animation.HTMLWriter

</div>

The provided writers fall into a few broad categories.

The Pillow writer relies on the Pillow library to write the animation, keeping all data in memory.

<div class="autosummary" data-toctree="_as_gen" data-nosignatures="">

PillowWriter

</div>

The HTML writer generates JavaScript-based animations.

<div class="autosummary" data-toctree="_as_gen" data-nosignatures="">

HTMLWriter

</div>

The pipe-based writers stream the captured frames over a pipe to an external process. The pipe-based variants tend to be more performant, but may not work on all systems.

<div class="autosummary" data-toctree="_as_gen" data-nosignatures="">

FFMpegWriter ImageMagickWriter

</div>

The file-based writers save temporary files for each frame which are stitched into a single file at the end. Although slower, these writers can be easier to debug.

<div class="autosummary" data-toctree="_as_gen" data-nosignatures="">

FFMpegFileWriter ImageMagickFileWriter

</div>

The writer classes provide a way to grab sequential frames from the same underlying <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure</span>. They all provide three methods that must be called in sequence:

  - <span class="title-ref">\~.AbstractMovieWriter.setup</span> prepares the writer (e.g. opening a pipe). Pipe-based and file-based writers take different arguments to `setup()`.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~.AbstractMovieWriter.grab\_frame</span> can then be called as often as needed to capture a single frame at a time
  - <span class="title-ref">\~.AbstractMovieWriter.finish</span> finalizes the movie and writes the output file to disk.

Example:

    moviewriter = MovieWriter(...)
    moviewriter.setup(fig, 'my_movie.ext', dpi=100)
    for j in range(n):
        update_figure(j)
        moviewriter.grab_frame()
    moviewriter.finish()

If using the writer classes directly (not through <span class="title-ref">Animation.save</span>), it is strongly encouraged to use the <span class="title-ref">\~.AbstractMovieWriter.saving</span> context manager:

    with moviewriter.saving(fig, 'myfile.mp4', dpi=100):
        for j in range(n):
            update_figure(j)
            moviewriter.grab_frame()

to ensure that setup and cleanup are performed as necessary.

## Qt Bindings

There are currently 2 actively supported Qt versions, Qt5 and Qt6, and two supported Python bindings per version -- [PyQt5](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt5/) and [PySide2](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-5/contents.html) for Qt5 and [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/) and [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/contents.html) for Qt6\[1\]. Matplotlib's qtagg and qtcairo backends (`matplotlib.backends.backend_qtagg` and `matplotlib.backend.backend_qtcairo`) support all these bindings, with common parts factored out in the `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt` module.

At runtime, these backends select the actual binding used as follows:

1.  If a binding's `QtCore` subpackage is already imported, that binding is selected (the order for the check is `PyQt6`, `PySide6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide2`).
2.  If the `QT_API` environment variable is set to one of "PyQt6", "PySide6", "PyQt5", "PySide2" (case-insensitive), that binding is selected. (See also the documentation on \[environment-variables\](\#environment-variables).)
3.  Otherwise, the first available backend in the order `PyQt6`, `PySide6`, `PyQt5`, `PySide2` is selected.

In the past, Matplotlib used to have separate backends for each version of Qt (e.g. qt4agg/`matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg` and qt5agg/`matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg`). This scheme was dropped when support for Qt6 was added. For back-compatibility, qt5agg/`backend_qt5agg` and qt5cairo/`backend_qt5cairo` remain available; selecting one of these backends forces the use of a Qt5 binding. Their use is discouraged and `backend_qtagg` or `backend_qtcairo` should be preferred instead. However, these modules will not be deprecated until we drop support for Qt5.

While both PyQt and Qt for Python (aka PySide) closely mirror the underlying C++ API they are wrapping, they are not drop-in replacements for each other\[2\]. To account for this, Matplotlib has an internal API compatibility layer in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.qt\_compat</span> which covers our needs. Despite being a public module, we do not consider this to be a stable user-facing API and it may change without warning\[3\].

1.  There is also [PyQt4](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt4/) and [PySide](https://srinikom.github.io/pyside-docs/) for Qt4 but these are no longer supported by Matplotlib and upstream support for Qt4 ended in 2015.

2.  Despite the slight API differences, the more important distinction between the PyQt and Qt for Python series of bindings is licensing.

3.  If you are looking for a general purpose compatibility library please see [qtpy](https://github.com/spyder-ide/qtpy).

# API Reference

## Matplotlib interfaces

Matplotlib has two interfaces. See \[api\_interfaces\](\#api\_interfaces) for a more detailed description of both and their recommended use cases.

<div class="grid" data-padding="0" data-gutter="2">

1 1 2 2

<div class="grid-item-card" data-shadow="none" data-class-footer="api-interface-footer">

**Axes interface** (object-based, explicit)

create a <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> and one or more <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> objects, then *explicitly* use methods on these objects to add data, configure limits, set labels etc.

-----

API:

  - \`\~.pyplot.subplots\`: create Figure and Axes
  - `~matplotlib.axes`: add data, limits, labels etc.
  - \`.Figure\`: for figure-level methods

-----

Example:

``` python api-interface-example
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot(x, y)
ax.set_title("Sample plot")
plt.show()
```

</div>

<div class="grid-item-card" data-shadow="none" data-class-footer="api-interface-footer">

**pyplot interface** (function-based, implicit)

consists of functions in the <span class="title-ref">.pyplot</span> module. Figure and Axes are manipulated through these functions and are only *implicitly* present in the background.

-----

API:

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot</span>

-----

Example:

``` python api-interface-example
plt.plot(x, y)
plt.title("Sample plot")
plt.show()
```

# Adding API change notes

API change notes for future releases are collected in `doc/api/next_api_changes/`. They are divided into four subdirectories:

  - **Deprecations**: Announcements of future changes. Typically, these will raise a deprecation warning and users of this API should change their code to stay compatible with future releases of Matplotlib. If possible, state what should be used instead.
  - **Removals**: Parts of the API that got removed. If possible, state what should be used instead.
  - **Behaviour changes**: API that stays valid but will yield a different result.
  - **Development changes**: Changes to the build process, dependencies, etc.

Please place new entries in these directories with a new file named `99999-ABC.rst`, where `99999` would be the PR number, and `ABC` the author's initials. Typically, each change will get its own file, but you may also amend existing files when suitable. The overall goal is a comprehensible documentation of the changes.

A typical entry could look like this:

    Locators
    ~~~~~~~~
    The unused `Locator.autoscale()` method is deprecated (pass the axis
    limits to `Locator.view_limits()` instead).

Please avoid using references in section titles, as it causes links to be confusing in the table of contents. Instead, ensure that a reference is included in the descriptive text.

# onselect argument to selector widgets made optional

The *onselect* argument to <span class="title-ref">.EllipseSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">.LassoSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">.PolygonSelector</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.RectangleSelector</span> is no longer required.

# `NavigationToolbar2.save_figure` now returns filepath of saved figure

`NavigationToolbar2.save_figure` function may return the filename of the saved figure.

If a backend implements this functionality it should return <span class="title-ref">None</span> in the case where no figure is actually saved (because the user closed the dialog without saving).

If the backend does not or can not implement this functionality (currently the Gtk4 backends and webagg backends do not) this method will return `NavigationToolbar2.UNKNOWN_SAVED_STATUS`.

# SVG output: improved reproducibility

Some SVG-format plots [produced different output on each render](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/27831), even with a static `svg.hashsalt` value configured.

The problem was a non-deterministic ID-generation scheme for clip paths; the fix introduces a repeatable, monotonically increasing integer ID scheme as a replacement.

Provided that plots add clip paths themselves in deterministic order, this enables repeatable (a.k.a. reproducible, deterministic) SVG output.

# ft2font classes are now final

# `InsetIndicator` artist

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.indicate\_inset</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.indicate\_inset\_zoom</span> now return an instance of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.inset.InsetIndicator</span>. Use the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.inset.InsetIndicator.rectangle</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.inset.InsetIndicator.connectors</span> properties of this artist to access the objects that were previously returned directly.

# `imshow` *interpolation\_stage* default changed to 'auto'

The *interpolation\_stage* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.imshow</span> has a new default value 'auto'. For images that are up-sampled less than a factor of three or down-sampled, image interpolation will occur in 'rgba' space. For images that are up-sampled by a factor of 3 or more, then image interpolation occurs in 'data' space.

The previous default was 'data', so down-sampled images may change subtly with the new default. However, the new default also avoids floating point artifacts at sharp boundaries in a colormap when down-sampling.

The previous behavior can achieved by setting the *interpolation\_stage* parameter or `image.interpolation_stage` to 'data'.

# imshow default *interpolation* changed to 'auto'

The *interpolation* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.imshow</span> has a new default value 'auto', changed from 'antialiased', for consistency with *interpolation\_stage* and because the interpolation is only anti-aliasing during down-sampling. Passing 'antialiased' still works, and behaves exactly the same as 'auto', but is discouraged.

# dark\_background and fivethirtyeight styles no longer set `savefig.facecolor` and `savefig.edgecolor`

When using these styles, `savefig.facecolor` and `savefig.edgecolor` now inherit the global default value of "auto", which means that the actual figure colors will be used. Previously, these rcParams were set to the same values as `figure.facecolor` and `figure.edgecolor`, i.e. a saved figure would always use the theme colors even if the user manually overrode them; this is no longer the case.

This change should have no impact for users that do not manually set the figure face and edge colors.

# (Sub)Figure.get\_figure

...in future will by default return the direct parent figure, which may be a SubFigure. This will make the default behavior consistent with the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.artist.Artist.get\_figure</span> method of other artists. To control the behavior, use the newly introduced *root* parameter.

# Subfigures

<span class="title-ref">.Figure.subfigures</span> are now added in row-major order to be consistent with <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplots</span>. The return value of <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.subfigures</span> is not changed, but the order of `fig.subfigs` is.

# `transforms.AffineDeltaTransform` updates correctly on axis limit changes

---

# The offset string associated with ConciseDateFormatter will now invert when the axis is inverted

Previously, when the axis was inverted, the offset string associated with ConciseDateFormatter would not change, so the offset string indicated the axis was oriented in the wrong direction. Now, when the axis is inverted, the offset string is oriented correctly.

# `suptitle` in compressed layout

Compressed layout now automatically positions the <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.suptitle</span> just above the top row of axes. To keep this title in its previous position, either pass `in_layout=False` or explicitly set `y=0.98` in the <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.suptitle</span> call.

# `Tick.set_label`, `Tick.set_label1` and `Tick.set_label2`

... are removed. Calling these methods from third-party code usually had no effect, as the labels are overwritten at draw time by the tick formatter.

# Functions in `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d`

The function `transform` is just an alias for `proj_transform`, use the latter instead.

The following functions were either unused (so no longer required in Matplotlib) or considered private.

  - `ortho_transformation`
  - `persp_transformation`
  - `proj_points`
  - `proj_trans_points`
  - `rot_x`
  - `rotation_about_vector`
  - `view_transformation`

# Arguments other than `renderer` to `get_tightbbox`

... are keyword-only arguments. This is for consistency and that different classes have different additional arguments.

# Method parameters renamed to match base classes

The only parameter of `transform_affine` and `transform_non_affine` in `Transform` subclasses is renamed to *values*.

The *points* parameter of `transforms.IdentityTransform.transform` is renamed to *values*.

The *trans* parameter of `table.Cell.set_transform` is renamed to *t* consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_transform</span>.

The *clippath* parameters of `axis.Axis.set_clip_path` and `axis.Tick.set_clip_path` are renamed to *path* consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_clip\_path</span>.

The *s* parameter of `images.NonUniformImage.set_filternorm` is renamed to *filternorm* consistently with `_ImageBase.set_filternorm`.

The *s* parameter of `images.NonUniformImage.set_filterrad` is renamed to *filterrad* consistently with `_ImageBase.set_filterrad`.

The only parameter of `Annotation.contains` and `Legend.contains` is renamed to *mouseevent* consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.contains</span>.

# Method parameters renamed

The *p* parameter of `BboxBase.padded` is renamed to *w\_pad*, consistently with the other parameter, *h\_pad*

# *numdecs* parameter and attribute of `LogLocator`

... are removed without replacement, because they had no effect.

# The `PolyQuadMesh` class requires full 2D arrays of values

Previously, if a masked array was input, the list of polygons within the collection would shrink to the size of valid polygons and users were required to keep track of which polygons were drawn and call `set_array()` with the smaller "compressed" array size. Passing the "compressed" and flattened array values will no longer work and the full 2D array of values (including the mask) should be passed to <span class="title-ref">.PolyQuadMesh.set\_array</span>.

Positional arguments passed to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_axes</span> other than a rect or an existing `Axes` were previously ignored, and is now an error.

# Artists explicitly passed in will no longer be filtered by legend() based on their label

Previously, artists explicitly passed to `legend(handles=[...])` are filtered out if their label starts with an underscore. This filter is no longer applied; explicitly filter out such artists (`[art for art in artists if not art.get_label().startswith('_')]`) if necessary.

Note that if no handles are specified at all, then the default still filters out labels starting with an underscore.

# The parameter of `Annotation.contains` and `Legend.contains` is renamed to *mouseevent*

... consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.contains</span>.

# Support for passing the "frac" key in `annotate(..., arrowprops={"frac": ...})`

... has been removed. This key has had no effect since Matplotlib 1.5.

# Passing non-int or sequence of non-int to `Table.auto_set_column_width`

Column numbers are ints, and formerly passing any other type was effectively ignored. This has now become an error.

# Widgets

The *visible* attribute getter of `*Selector` widgets has been removed; use `get_visible` instead.

# Auto-closing of figures when switching backend

Allowable backend switches (i.e. those that do not swap a GUI event loop with another one) will not close existing figures. If necessary, call `plt.close("all")` before switching.

# `FigureCanvasBase.switch_backends`

... has been removed with no replacement.

# Accessing `event.guiEvent` after event handlers return

... is no longer supported, and `event.guiEvent` will be set to None once the event handlers return. For some GUI toolkits, it is unsafe to use the event, though you may separately stash the object at your own risk.

# `PdfPages(keep_empty=True)`

A zero-page PDF is not valid, thus passing `keep_empty=True` to <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> and <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span>, and the `keep_empty` attribute of these classes, is no longer allowed, and empty PDF files will not be created.

Furthermore, <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> no longer immediately creates the target file upon instantiation, but only when the first figure is saved. To fully control file creation, directly pass an opened file object as argument (`with open(path, "wb") as file, PdfPages(file) as pdf: ...`).

# `backend_ps.psDefs`

The `psDefs` module-level variable in `backend_ps` has been removed with no replacement.

# Automatic papersize selection in PostScript

Setting `ps.papersize` to `'auto'` or passing `papersize='auto'` to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span> is no longer supported. Either pass an explicit paper type name, or omit this parameter to use the default from the rcParam.

# `RendererAgg.tostring_rgb` and `FigureCanvasAgg.tostring_rgb`

... have been remove with no direct replacement. Consider using `buffer_rgba` instead, which should cover most use cases.

# `NavigationToolbar2QT.message` has been removed

... with no replacement.

# `TexManager.texcache`

... is considered private and has been removed. The location of the cache directory is clarified in the doc-string.

# `cbook` API changes

`cbook.Stack` has been removed with no replacement.

`Grouper.clean()` has been removed with no replacement. The Grouper class now cleans itself up automatically.

The *np\_load* parameter of `cbook.get_sample_data` has been removed; <span class="title-ref">.get\_sample\_data</span> now auto-loads numpy arrays. Use `get_sample_data(..., asfileobj=False)` instead to get the filename of the data file, which can then be passed to <span class="title-ref">open</span>, if desired.

# Calling `paths.get_path_collection_extents` with empty *offsets*

Calling <span class="title-ref">\~.get\_path\_collection\_extents</span> with an empty *offsets* parameter has an ambiguous interpretation and is no longer allowed.

# `bbox.anchored()` with no explicit container

Not passing a *container* argument to <span class="title-ref">.BboxBase.anchored</span> is no longer supported.

# `INVALID_NON_AFFINE`, `INVALID_AFFINE`, `INVALID` attributes of `TransformNode`

These attributes have been removed.

# `axes_grid1` API changes

`anchored_artists.AnchoredEllipse` has been removed. Instead, directly construct an <span class="title-ref">.AnchoredOffsetbox</span>, an <span class="title-ref">.AuxTransformBox</span>, and an <span class="title-ref">\~.patches.Ellipse</span>, as demonstrated in \[/gallery/misc/anchored\_artists\](/gallery/misc/anchored\_artists.md).

The `axes_divider.AxesLocator` class has been removed. The `new_locator` method of divider instances now instead returns an opaque callable (which can still be passed to `ax.set_axes_locator`).

`axes_divider.Divider.locate` has been removed; use `Divider.new_locator(...)(ax, renderer)` instead.

`axes_grid.CbarAxesBase.toggle_label` has been removed. Instead, use standard methods for manipulating colorbar labels (<span class="title-ref">.Colorbar.set\_label</span>) and tick labels (<span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span>).

`inset_location.InsetPosition` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.inset\_axes</span> instead.

# `axisartist` API changes

The `axisartist.axes_grid` and `axisartist.axes_rgb` modules, which provide wrappers combining the functionality of <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axisartist</span>, have been removed; directly use e.g. `AxesGrid(..., axes_class=axislines.Axes)` instead.

Calling an axisartist Axes to mean <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.axis</span> has been removed; explicitly call the method instead.

`floating_axes.GridHelperCurveLinear.get_data_boundary` has been removed. Use `grid_finder.extreme_finder(*[None] * 5)` to get the extremes of the grid.

# Changes for 0.50

`` `text * refactored Figure class so it is no longer backend dependent.   FigureCanvasBackend takes over the backend specific duties of the   Figure.  matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureBase moved to   matplotlib.figure.Figure.  * backends must implement FigureCanvasBackend (the thing that   controls the figure and handles the events if any) and   FigureManagerBackend (wraps the canvas and the window for MATLAB   interface).  FigureCanvasBase implements a backend switching   mechanism  * Figure is now an Artist (like everything else in the figure) and   is totally backend independent  * GDFONTPATH renamed to TTFPATH  * backend faceColor argument changed to rgbFace  * colormap stuff moved to colors.py  * arg_to_rgb in backend_bases moved to class ColorConverter in   colors.py  * GD users must upgrade to gd-2.0.22 and gdmodule-0.52 since new gd   features (clipping, antialiased lines) are now used.  * Renderer must implement points_to_pixels  Migrating code:  MATLAB interface:    The only API change for those using the MATLAB interface is in how   you call figure redraws for dynamically updating figures.  In the   old API, you did      fig.draw()    In the new API, you do      manager = get_current_fig_manager()     manager.canvas.draw()    See the examples system_monitor.py, dynamic_demo.py, and anim.py  API    There is one important API change for application developers.   Figure instances used subclass GUI widgets that enabled them to be   placed directly into figures.  e.g., FigureGTK subclassed   gtk.DrawingArea.  Now the Figure class is independent of the   backend, and FigureCanvas takes over the functionality formerly   handled by Figure.  In order to include figures into your apps,   you now need to do, for example      # gtk example     fig = Figure(figsize=(5,4), dpi=100)     canvas = FigureCanvasGTK(fig)  # a gtk.DrawingArea     canvas.show()     vbox.pack_start(canvas)    If you use the NavigationToolbar, this in now initialized with a   FigureCanvas, not a Figure.  The examples embedding_in_gtk.py,   embedding_in_gtk2.py, and mpl_with_glade.py all reflect the new   API so use these as a guide.    All prior calls to     figure.draw()  and    figure.print_figure(args)    should now be     canvas.draw()  and    canvas.print_figure(args)    Apologies for the inconvenience.  This refactorization brings   significant more freedom in developing matplotlib and should bring   better plotting capabilities, so I hope the inconvenience is worth   it. ``\`

# Changes for 0.54

## MATLAB interface

### dpi

Several of the backends used a PIXELS\_PER\_INCH hack that I added to try and make images render consistently across backends. This just complicated matters. So you may find that some font sizes and line widths appear different than before. Apologies for the inconvenience. You should set the dpi to an accurate value for your screen to get true sizes.

### pcolor and scatter

There are two changes to the MATLAB interface API, both involving the patch drawing commands. For efficiency, pcolor and scatter have been rewritten to use polygon collections, which are a new set of objects from matplotlib.collections designed to enable efficient handling of large collections of objects. These new collections make it possible to build large scatter plots or pcolor plots with no loops at the python level, and are significantly faster than their predecessors. The original pcolor and scatter functions are retained as pcolor\_classic and scatter\_classic.

The return value from pcolor is a PolyCollection. Most of the properties that are available on rectangles or other patches are also available on PolyCollections, e.g., you can say:

    c = scatter(blah, blah)
    c.set_linewidth(1.0)
    c.set_facecolor('r')
    c.set_alpha(0.5)

or:

    c = scatter(blah, blah)
    set(c, 'linewidth', 1.0, 'facecolor', 'r', 'alpha', 0.5)

Because the collection is a single object, you no longer need to loop over the return value of scatter or pcolor to set properties for the entire list.

If you want the different elements of a collection to vary on a property, e.g., to have different line widths, see matplotlib.collections for a discussion on how to set the properties as a sequence.

For scatter, the size argument is now in points^2 (the area of the symbol in points) as in MATLAB and is not in data coords as before. Using sizes in data coords caused several problems. So you will need to adjust your size arguments accordingly or use scatter\_classic.

### mathtext spacing

For reasons not clear to me (and which I'll eventually fix) spacing no longer works in font groups. However, I added three new spacing commands which compensate for this '' (regular space), '/' (small space) and 'hspace{frac}' where frac is a fraction of fontsize in points. You will need to quote spaces in font strings, is:

    title(r'$\rm{Histogram\ of\ IQ:}\ \mu=100,\ \sigma=15$')

## Object interface - Application programmers

### Autoscaling

The x and y axis instances no longer have autoscale view. These are handled by axes.autoscale\_view

### Axes creation

You should not instantiate your own Axes any more using the OO API. Rather, create a Figure as before and in place of:

    f = Figure(figsize=(5,4), dpi=100)
    a = Subplot(f, 111)
    f.add_axis(a)

use:

    f = Figure(figsize=(5,4), dpi=100)
    a = f.add_subplot(111)

That is, add\_axis no longer exists and is replaced by:

    add_axes(rect, axisbg=defaultcolor, frameon=True)
    add_subplot(num, axisbg=defaultcolor, frameon=True)

### Artist methods

If you define your own Artists, you need to rename the \_draw method to draw

### Bounding boxes

matplotlib.transforms.Bound2D is replaced by matplotlib.transforms.Bbox. If you want to construct a bbox from left, bottom, width, height (the signature for Bound2D), use matplotlib.transforms.lbwh\_to\_bbox, as in:

    bbox = clickBBox = lbwh_to_bbox(left, bottom, width, height)

The Bbox has a different API than the Bound2D. e.g., if you want to get the width and height of the bbox

**OLD**:

    width  = fig.bbox.x.interval()
    height = fig.bbox.y.interval()

**NEW**:

    width  = fig.bbox.width()
    height = fig.bbox.height()

### Object constructors

You no longer pass the bbox, dpi, or transforms to the various Artist constructors. The old way or creating lines and rectangles was cumbersome because you had to pass so many attributes to the Line2D and Rectangle classes not related directly to the geometry and properties of the object. Now default values are added to the object when you call axes.add\_line or axes.add\_patch, so they are hidden from the user.

If you want to define a custom transformation on these objects, call o.set\_transform(trans) where trans is a Transformation instance.

In prior versions of you wanted to add a custom line in data coords, you would have to do:

    l = Line2D(dpi, bbox, x, y,
               color = color,
               transx = transx,
               transy = transy,
               )

now all you need is:

    l = Line2D(x, y, color=color)

and the axes will set the transformation for you (unless you have set your own already, in which case it will eave it unchanged)

### Transformations

The entire transformation architecture has been rewritten. Previously the x and y transformations where stored in the xaxis and yaxis instances. The problem with this approach is it only allows for separable transforms (where the x and y transformations don't depend on one another). But for cases like polar, they do. Now transformations operate on x,y together. There is a new base class matplotlib.transforms.Transformation and two concrete implementations, matplotlib.transforms.SeparableTransformation and matplotlib.transforms.Affine. The SeparableTransformation is constructed with the bounding box of the input (this determines the rectangular coordinate system of the input, i.e., the x and y view limits), the bounding box of the display, and possibly nonlinear transformations of x and y. The 2 most frequently used transformations, data coordinates -\> display and axes coordinates -\> display are available as ax.transData and ax.transAxes. See alignment\_demo.py which uses axes coords.

Also, the transformations should be much faster now, for two reasons

  - they are written entirely in extension code

  - because they operate on x and y together, they can do the entire transformation in one loop. Earlier I did something along the lines of:
    
        xt = sx*func(x) + tx
        yt = sy*func(y) + ty
    
    Although this was done in numerix, it still involves 6 length(x) for-loops (the multiply, add, and function evaluation each for x and y). Now all of that is done in a single pass.

If you are using transformations and bounding boxes to get the cursor position in data coordinates, the method calls are a little different now. See the updated examples/coords\_demo.py which shows you how to do this.

Likewise, if you are using the artist bounding boxes to pick items on the canvas with the GUI, the bbox methods are somewhat different. You will need to see the updated examples/object\_picker.py.

See unit/transforms\_unit.py for many examples using the new transformations.

Current version will issue a   deprecation warning which will be removed in future versions  - imshow interpolation arguments changes for advanced interpolation   schemes.  See help imshow, particularly the interpolation,   filternorm and filterrad kwargs  - Support for masked arrays has been added to the plot command and   to the Line2D object.  Only the valid points are plotted.  A   "valid_only" kwarg was added to the get_xdata() and get_ydata()   methods of Line2D; by default it is False, so that the original   data arrays are returned. Setting it to True returns the plottable   points.  - contour changes:    Masked arrays: contour and contourf now accept masked arrays as     the variable to be contoured.  Masking works correctly for     contour, but a bug remains to be fixed before it will work for     contourf.  The "badmask" kwarg has been removed from both     functions.     Level argument changes:       Old version: a list of levels as one of the positional      arguments specified the lower bound of each filled region; the      upper bound of the last region was taken as a very large      number.  Hence, it was not possible to specify that z values      between 0 and 1, for example, be filled, and that values      outside that range remain unfilled.       New version: a list of N levels is taken as specifying the      boundaries of N-1 z ranges.  Now the user has more control over      what is colored and what is not.  Repeated calls to contourf      (with different colormaps or color specifications, for example)      can be used to color different ranges of z.  Values of z      outside an expected range are left uncolored.       Example:        Old: contourf(z, [0, 1, 2]) would yield 3 regions: 0-1, 1-2, and >2.        New: it would yield 2 regions: 0-1, 1-2.  If the same 3 regions were        desired, the equivalent list of levels would be [0, 1, 2,        1e38]. ``\`

`` `text - toolbar import change in GTKAgg, GTKCairo and WXAgg  - Added subplot config tool to GTK* backends -- note you must now   import the NavigationToolbar2 from your backend of choice rather   than from backend_gtk because it needs to know about the backend   specific canvas -- see examples/embedding_in_gtk2.py.  Ditto for   wx backend -- see examples/embedding_in_wxagg.py   - hist bin change      Sean Richards notes there was a problem in the way we created     the binning for histogram, which made the last bin     underrepresented.  From his post:        I see that hist uses the linspace function to create the bins       and then uses searchsorted to put the values in their correct       bin. That's all good but I am confused over the use of linspace       for the bin creation. I wouldn't have thought that it does       what is needed, to quote the docstring it creates a "Linear       spaced array from min to max". For it to work correctly       shouldn't the values in the bins array be the same bound for       each bin? (i.e. each value should be the lower bound of a       bin). To provide the correct bins for hist would it not be       something like        def bins(xmin, xmax, N):         if N==1: return xmax         dx = (xmax-xmin)/N # instead of N-1         return xmin + dx*arange(N)        This suggestion is implemented in 0.81.

If old files are found, a warning is issued and they are moved to   the new location.  - backends/__init__.py no longer imports new_figure_manager,   draw_if_interactive and show from the default backend, but puts   these imports into a call to pylab_setup.  Also, the Toolbar is no   longer imported from WX/WXAgg.  New usage:      from backends import pylab_setup     new_figure_manager, draw_if_interactive, show = pylab_setup()  - Moved Figure.get_width_height() to FigureCanvasBase.

`` `text Made xtick and ytick separate props in rc  made pos=None the default for tick formatters rather than 0 to indicate "not supplied"  Removed "feature" of minor ticks which prevents them from overlapping major ticks.  Often you want major and minor ticks at the same place, and can offset the major ticks with the pad.  This could be made configurable  Changed the internal structure of contour.py to a more OO style. Calls to contour or contourf in axes.py or pylab.py now return a ContourSet object which contains references to the LineCollections or PolyCollections created by the call, as well as the configuration variables that were used. The ContourSet object is a "mappable" if a colormap was used.  Added a clip_ends kwarg to contourf. From the docstring:          * clip_ends = True            If False, the limits for color scaling are set to the            minimum and maximum contour levels.            True (default) clips the scaling limits.  Example:            if the contour boundaries are V = [-100, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2, 100],            then the scaling limits will be [-100, 100] if clip_ends            is False, and [-3, 3] if clip_ends is True. Added kwargs linewidths, antialiased, and nchunk to contourf.  These are experimental; see the docstring.  Changed Figure.colorbar():     kw argument order changed;     if mappable arg is a non-filled ContourSet, colorbar() shows             lines instead hof polygons.     if mappable arg is a filled ContourSet with clip_ends=True,             the endpoints are not labelled, so as to give the             correct impression of open-endedness.  Changed LineCollection.get_linewidths to get_linewidth, for consistency. ``\`

`` `text Matplotlib data is installed into the matplotlib module. This is similar to package_data.  This should get rid of having to check for many possibilities in _get_data_path(). The MATPLOTLIBDATA env key is still checked first to allow for flexibility.  1) Separated the color table data from cm.py out into a new file, _cm.py, to make it easier to find the actual code in cm.py and to add new colormaps. Everything from _cm.py is imported by cm.py, so the split should be transparent. 2) Enabled automatic generation of a colormap from a list of colors in contour; see modified examples/contour_demo.py. 3) Support for imshow of a masked array, with the ability to specify colors (or no color at all) for masked regions, and for regions that are above or below the normally mapped region.  See examples/image_masked.py. 4) In support of the above, added two new classes, ListedColormap, and no_norm, to colors.py, and modified the Colormap class to include common functionality.

`` `text Completely reworked the annotations API because I found the old API cumbersome.  The new design is much more legible and easy to read.  See matplotlib.text.Annotation and examples/annotation_demo.py  markeredgecolor and markerfacecolor cannot be configured in matplotlibrc any more. Instead, markers are generally colored automatically based on the color of the line, unless marker colors are explicitly set as kwargs - NN  Changed default comment character for load to '#' - JDH  math_parse_s_ft2font_svg from mathtext.py & mathtext2.py now returns width, height, svg_elements. svg_elements is an instance of Bunch ( cmbook.py) and has the attributes svg_glyphs and svg_lines, which are both lists.  Renderer.draw_arc now takes an additional parameter, rotation. It specifies to draw the artist rotated in degrees anti- clockwise.  It was added for rotated ellipses.  Renamed Figure.set_figsize_inches to Figure.set_size_inches to better match the get method, Figure.get_size_inches.  Removed the copy_bbox_transform from transforms.py; added shallowcopy methods to all transforms.  All transforms already had deepcopy methods.  FigureManager.resize(width, height): resize the window specified in pixels  barh: x and y args have been renamed to width and bottom respectively, and their order has been swapped to maintain a (position, value) order.  bar and barh: now accept kwarg 'edgecolor'.  bar and barh: The left, height, width and bottom args can now all be scalars or sequences; see docstring.  barh: now defaults to edge aligned instead of center aligned bars  bar, barh and hist: Added a keyword arg 'align' that controls between edge or center bar alignment.  Collections: PolyCollection and LineCollection now accept vertices or segments either in the original form [(x,y), (x,y), ...] or as a 2D numerix array, with X as the first column and Y as the second. Contour and quiver output the numerix form.  The transforms methods Bbox.update() and Transformation.seq_xy_tups() now accept either form.  Collections: LineCollection is now a ScalarMappable like PolyCollection, etc.  Specifying a grayscale color as a float is deprecated; use a string instead, e.g., 0.75 -> '0.75'.  Collections: initializers now accept any mpl color arg, or sequence of such args; previously only a sequence of rgba tuples was accepted.  Colorbar: completely new version and api; see docstring.  The original version is still accessible as colorbar_classic, but is deprecated.  Contourf: "extend" kwarg replaces "clip_ends"; see docstring. Masked array support added to pcolormesh.

Rather, set the "picker" property of any artist you want to pick on (the epsilon distance in points for a hit test) and register with the "pick_event" callback.  See examples/pick_event_demo.py for details  Bar, barh, and hist have "log" binary kwarg: log=True sets the ordinate to a log scale.  Boxplot can handle a list of vectors instead of just an array, so vectors can have different lengths.  Plot can handle 2-D x and/or y; it plots the columns.  Added linewidth kwarg to bar and barh.  Made the default Artist._transform None (rather than invoking identity_transform for each artist only to have it overridden later).  Use artist.get_transform() rather than artist._transform, even in derived classes, so that the default transform will be created lazily as needed  New LogNorm subclass of Normalize added to colors.py.

`` `text The file dviread.py has a (very limited and fragile) dvi reader for usetex support. The API might change in the future so don't depend on it yet.  Removed deprecated support for a float value as a gray-scale; now it must be a string, like '0.5'.  Added alpha kwarg to ColorConverter.to_rgba_list.  New method set_bounds(vmin, vmax) for formatters, locators sets the viewInterval and dataInterval from floats.  Removed deprecated colorbar_classic.  Line2D.get_xdata and get_ydata valid_only=False kwarg is replaced by orig=True.  When True, it returns the original data, otherwise the processed data (masked, converted)  Some modifications to the units interface. units.ConversionInterface.tickers renamed to units.ConversionInterface.axisinfo and it now returns a units.AxisInfo object rather than a tuple.  This will make it easier to add axis info functionality (e.g., I added a default label on this iteration) w/o having to change the tuple length and hence the API of the client code every time new functionality is added. Also, units.ConversionInterface.convert_to_value is now simply named units.ConversionInterface.convert.  Axes.errorbar uses Axes.vlines and Axes.hlines to draw its error limits int he vertical and horizontal direction.  As you'll see in the changes below, these functions now return a LineCollection rather than a list of lines.  The new return signature for errorbar is  ylins, caplines, errorcollections where errorcollections is a xerrcollection, yerrcollection  Axes.vlines and Axes.hlines now create and returns a LineCollection, not a list of lines.  This is much faster.  The kwarg signature has changed, so consult the docs  MaxNLocator accepts a new Boolean kwarg ('integer') to force ticks to integer locations.  Commands that pass an argument to the Text constructor or to Text.set_text() now accept any object that can be converted with '%s'.  This affects xlabel(), title(), etc.  Barh now takes a **kwargs dict instead of most of the old arguments. This helps ensure that bar and barh are kept in sync, but as a side effect you can no longer pass e.g., color as a positional argument.  ft2font.get_charmap() now returns a dict that maps character codes to glyph indices (until now it was reversed)  Moved data files into lib/matplotlib so that setuptools' develop mode works. Re-organized the mpl-data layout so that this source structure is maintained in the installation. (i.e., the 'fonts' and 'images' sub-directories are maintained in site-packages.).

# Changes for 0.91.0

  - Changed `cbook.is_file_like` to `cbook.is_writable_file_like` and corrected behavior.
  - Added *ax* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> so that one can specify the axes object from which space for the colorbar is to be taken, if one does not want to make the colorbar axes manually.
  - Changed `cbook.reversed` so it yields a tuple rather than a (index, tuple). This agrees with the Python reversed builtin, and cbook only defines reversed if Python doesn't provide the builtin.
  - Made skiprows=1 the default on `csv2rec`
  - The gd and paint backends have been deleted.
  - The errorbar method and function now accept additional kwargs so that upper and lower limits can be indicated by capping the bar with a caret instead of a straight line segment.
  - The `matplotlib.dviread` file now has a parser for files like psfonts.map and pdftex.map, to map TeX font names to external files.
  - The file `matplotlib.type1font` contains a new class for Type 1 fonts. Currently it simply reads pfa and pfb format files and stores the data in a way that is suitable for embedding in pdf files. In the future the class might actually parse the font to allow e.g., subsetting.
  - `matplotlib.ft2font` now supports `FT_Attach_File`. In practice this can be used to read an afm file in addition to a pfa/pfb file, to get metrics and kerning information for a Type 1 font.
  - The `AFM` class now supports querying CapHeight and stem widths. The get\_name\_char method now has an isord kwarg like get\_width\_char.
  - Changed <span class="title-ref">.pcolor</span> default to `shading='flat'`; but as noted now in the docstring, it is preferable to simply use the *edgecolor* keyword argument.
  - The mathtext font commands (`\cal`, `\rm`, `\it`, `\tt`) now behave as TeX does: they are in effect until the next font change command or the end of the grouping. Therefore uses of `$\cal{R}$` should be changed to `${\cal R}$`. Alternatively, you may use the new LaTeX-style font commands (`\mathcal`, `\mathrm`, `\mathit`, `\mathtt`) which do affect the following group, e.g., `$\mathcal{R}$`.
  - Text creation commands have a new default linespacing and a new `linespacing` kwarg, which is a multiple of the maximum vertical extent of a line of ordinary text. The default is 1.2; `linespacing=2` would be like ordinary double spacing, for example.
  - Changed default kwarg in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Normalize</span> to `clip=False`; clipping silently defeats the purpose of the special over, under, and bad values in the colormap, thereby leading to unexpected behavior. The new default should reduce such surprises.
  - Made the emit property of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_ylim</span> `True` by default; removed the Axes custom callback handling into a 'callbacks' attribute which is a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> instance. This now supports the 'xlim\_changed' and 'ylim\_changed' Axes events.

  - For `csv2rec`, checkrows=0 is the new default indicating all rows will be checked for type inference
  - A warning is issued when an image is drawn on log-scaled axes, since it will not log-scale the image data.

  - Moved `rec2excel` to `matplotlib.toolkits.exceltools`

# Changes for 0.98.0

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.image.imread</span> now no longer always returns RGBA data---if the image is luminance or RGB, it will return a MxN or MxNx3 array if possible. Also uint8 is no longer always forced to float.
  - Rewrote the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable</span> callback infrastructure to use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> rather than custom callback handling. Any users of `matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable.add_observer` of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable</span> should use the `matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable.callbacksSM` <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> instead.
  - New axes function and Axes method provide control over the plot color cycle: `matplotlib.axes.set_default_color_cycle` and `matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_color_cycle`.
  - Matplotlib now requires Python 2.4, so `matplotlib.cbook` will no longer provide <span class="title-ref">set</span>, <span class="title-ref">enumerate</span>, <span class="title-ref">reversed</span> or `izip` compatibility functions.
  - In Numpy 1.0, bins are specified by the left edges only. The axes method <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist</span> now uses future Numpy 1.3 semantics for histograms. Providing `binedges`, the last value gives the upper-right edge now, which was implicitly set to +infinity in Numpy 1.0. This also means that the last bin doesn't contain upper outliers any more by default.
  - New axes method and pyplot function, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.hexbin</span>, is an alternative to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.scatter</span> for large datasets. It makes something like a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor</span> of a 2-D histogram, but uses hexagonal bins.
  - New kwarg, `symmetric`, in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator</span> allows one require an axis to be centered around zero.
  - Toolkits must now be imported from `mpl_toolkits` (not `matplotlib.toolkits`)

## Notes about the transforms refactoring

A major new feature of the 0.98 series is a more flexible and extensible transformation infrastructure, written in Python/Numpy rather than a custom C extension.

The primary goal of this refactoring was to make it easier to extend matplotlib to support new kinds of projections. This is mostly an internal improvement, and the possible user-visible changes it allows are yet to come.

See `matplotlib.transforms` for a description of the design of the new transformation framework.

For efficiency, many of these functions return views into Numpy arrays. This means that if you hold on to a reference to them, their contents may change. If you want to store a snapshot of their current values, use the Numpy array method copy().

The view intervals are now stored only in one place -- in the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> instance, not in the locator instances as well. This means locators must get their limits from their <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axis.Axis</span>, which in turn looks up its limits from the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span>. If a locator is used temporarily and not assigned to an Axis or Axes, (e.g., in `matplotlib.contour`), a dummy axis must be created to store its bounds. Call <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.TickHelper.create\_dummy\_axis</span> to do so.

The functionality of `Pbox` has been merged with <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Bbox</span>. Its methods now all return copies rather than modifying in place.

The following lists many of the simple changes necessary to update code from the old transformation framework to the new one. In particular, methods that return a copy are named with a verb in the past tense, whereas methods that alter an object in place are named with a verb in the present tense.

# Changes for 0.98.1

  - Removed broken `matplotlib.axes3d` support and replaced it with a non-implemented error pointing to 0.91.x

# Changes for 0.98.x

  - `psd()`, `csd()`, and `cohere()` will now automatically wrap negative frequency components to the beginning of the returned arrays. This is much more sensible behavior and makes them consistent with `specgram()`. The previous behavior was more of an oversight than a design decision.

  - Added new keyword parameters *nonposx*, *nonposy* to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> methods that set log scale parameters. The default is still to mask out non-positive values, but the kwargs accept 'clip', which causes non-positive values to be replaced with a very small positive value.

  - Added new <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.fignum\_exists</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.get\_fignums</span>; they merely expose information that had been hidden in `matplotlib._pylab_helpers`.

  - Deprecated numerix package.

  - Added new <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.image.imsave</span> and exposed it to the `matplotlib.pyplot` interface.

  - Remove support for pyExcelerator in exceltools -- use xlwt instead

  - Changed the defaults of acorr and xcorr to use usevlines=True, maxlags=10 and normed=True since these are the best defaults

  - Following keyword parameters for <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.legend.Legend</span> are now deprecated and new set of parameters are introduced. The new parameters are given as a fraction of the font-size. Also, *scatteryoffsets*, *fancybox* and *columnspacing* are added as keyword parameters.

    | handlelen      | handlelength  |
    | handlestextsep | handletextpad |
    | axespad        | borderaxespad |

  - Removed the configobj and experimental traits rc support

  - Modified <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.psd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.csd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.cohere</span>, and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.specgram</span> to scale one-sided densities by a factor of 2. Also, optionally scale the densities by the sampling frequency, which gives true values of densities that can be integrated by the returned frequency values. This also gives better MATLAB compatibility. The corresponding <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> methods and `matplotlib.pyplot` functions were updated as well.

  - Font lookup now uses a nearest-neighbor approach rather than an exact match. Some fonts may be different in plots, but should be closer to what was requested.

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_ylim</span> now return a copy of the `viewlim` array to avoid modify-in-place surprises.

  - `matplotlib.afm.AFM.get_fullname` and `matplotlib.afm.AFM.get_familyname` no longer raise an exception if the AFM file does not specify these optional attributes, but returns a guess based on the required FontName attribute.

  - Changed precision kwarg in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.spy</span>; default is 0, and the string value 'present' is used for sparse arrays only to show filled locations.

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.collections.EllipseCollection</span> added.

  - Added `angles` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.quiver</span> for more flexible specification of the arrow angles.

  - Deprecated (raise NotImplementedError) all the mlab2 functions from `matplotlib.mlab` out of concern that some of them were not clean room implementations.

  - Methods <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.collections.Collection.get\_offsets</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.collections.Collection.set\_offsets</span> added to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.Collection</span> base class.

  - `matplotlib.figure.Figure.figurePatch` renamed `matplotlib.figure.Figure.patch`; `matplotlib.axes.Axes.axesPatch` renamed `matplotlib.axes.Axes.patch`; `matplotlib.axes.Axes.axesFrame` renamed `matplotlib.axes.Axes.frame`. `matplotlib.axes.Axes.get_frame`, which returns `matplotlib.axes.Axes.patch`, is deprecated.

  - Changes in the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.contour.ContourLabeler</span> attributes (<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.clabel</span> function) so that they all have a form like `.labelAttribute`. The three attributes that are most likely to be used by end users, `.cl`, `.cl_xy` and `.cl_cvalues` have been maintained for the moment (in addition to their renamed versions), but they are deprecated and will eventually be removed.

  - Moved several functions in `matplotlib.mlab` and `matplotlib.cbook` into a separate module `matplotlib.numerical_methods` because they were unrelated to the initial purpose of mlab or cbook and appeared more coherent elsewhere.

# Changes in 0.99

  - pylab no longer provides a load and save function. These are available in matplotlib.mlab, or you can use numpy.loadtxt and numpy.savetxt for text files, or np.save and np.load for binary NumPy arrays.
  - User-generated colormaps can now be added to the set recognized by `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`. Colormaps can be made the default and applied to the current image using <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.set\_cmap</span>.
  - changed use\_mrecords default to False in mlab.csv2rec since this is partially broken
  - Axes instances no longer have a "frame" attribute. Instead, use the new "spines" attribute. Spines is a dictionary where the keys are the names of the spines (e.g., 'left','right' and so on) and the values are the artists that draw the spines. For normal (rectilinear) axes, these artists are Line2D instances. For other axes (such as polar axes), these artists may be Patch instances.
  - Polar plots no longer accept a resolution kwarg. Instead, each Path must specify its own number of interpolation steps. This is unlikely to be a user-visible change -- if interpolation of data is required, that should be done before passing it to Matplotlib.

# Changes beyond 0.99.x

  - The default behavior of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_ylim</span>, and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.axis</span>, and their corresponding pyplot functions, has been changed: when view limits are set explicitly with one of these methods, autoscaling is turned off for the matching axis. A new *auto* kwarg is available to control this behavior. The limit kwargs have been renamed to *left* and *right* instead of *xmin* and *xmax*, and *bottom* and *top* instead of *ymin* and *ymax*. The old names may still be used, however.

  - There are five new Axes methods with corresponding pyplot functions to facilitate autoscaling, tick location, and tick label formatting, and the general appearance of ticks and tick labels:
    
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.autoscale</span> turns autoscaling on or off, and applies it.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.margins</span> sets margins used to autoscale the `matplotlib.axes.Axes.viewLim` based on the `matplotlib.axes.Axes.dataLim`.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.locator\_params</span> allows one to adjust axes locator parameters such as *nbins*.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.ticklabel\_format</span> is a convenience method for controlling the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter</span> that is used by default with linear axes.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span> controls direction, size, visibility, and color of ticks and their labels.

  - The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar</span> method accepts a *error\_kw* kwarg; it is a dictionary of kwargs to be passed to the errorbar function.

  - The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist</span> *color* kwarg now accepts a sequence of color specs to match a sequence of datasets.

  - The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.EllipseCollection</span> has been changed in two ways:
    
      - There is a new *units* option, 'xy', that scales the ellipse with the data units. This matches the :class:'\~matplotlib.patches.Ellipse\` scaling.
      - The *height* and *width* kwargs have been changed to specify the height and width, again for consistency with <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Ellipse</span>, and to better match their names; previously they specified the half-height and half-width.

  - There is a new rc parameter `axes.color_cycle`, and the color cycle is now independent of the rc parameter `lines.color`. `matplotlib.Axes.set_default_color_cycle` is deprecated.

  - You can now print several figures to one pdf file and modify the document information dictionary of a pdf file. See the docstrings of the class <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> for more information.

  - Removed [configobj](http://www.voidspace.org.uk/python/configobj.html) and [enthought.traits](http://code.enthought.com/pages/traits.html) packages, which are only required by the experimental traited config and are somewhat out of date. If needed, install them independently.

  - The new rc parameter `savefig.extension` sets the filename extension that is used by <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig</span> if its *fname* argument lacks an extension.

  - In an effort to simplify the backend API, all clipping rectangles and paths are now passed in using GraphicsContext objects, even on collections and images. Therefore:
    
        draw_path_collection(self, master_transform, cliprect, clippath,
                             clippath_trans, paths, all_transforms, offsets,
                             offsetTrans, facecolors, edgecolors, linewidths,
                             linestyles, antialiaseds, urls)
        
        # is now
        
        draw_path_collection(self, gc, master_transform, paths, all_transforms,
                             offsets, offsetTrans, facecolors, edgecolors,
                             linewidths, linestyles, antialiaseds, urls)

        draw_quad_mesh(self, master_transform, cliprect, clippath,
                       clippath_trans, meshWidth, meshHeight, coordinates,
                       offsets, offsetTrans, facecolors, antialiased,
                       showedges)
        
        # is now
        
        draw_quad_mesh(self, gc, master_transform, meshWidth, meshHeight,
                       coordinates, offsets, offsetTrans, facecolors,
                       antialiased, showedges)

        draw_image(self, x, y, im, bbox, clippath=None, clippath_trans=None)
        
        # is now
        
        draw_image(self, gc, x, y, im)

  - There are four new Axes methods with corresponding pyplot functions that deal with unstructured triangular grids:
    
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.tricontour</span> draws contour lines on a triangular grid.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.tricontourf</span> draws filled contours on a triangular grid.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.tripcolor</span> draws a pseudocolor plot on a triangular grid.
      - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.triplot</span> draws a triangular grid as lines and/or markers.

api_changes_1.1.x.md

# API Changes in 1.1.x

  - Added new <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sankey.Sankey</span> for generating Sankey diagrams.
  - In <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow</span>, setting *interpolation* to 'nearest' will now always mean that the nearest-neighbor interpolation is performed. If you want the no-op interpolation to be performed, choose 'none'.
  - There were errors in how the tri-functions were handling input parameters that had to be fixed. If your tri-plots are not working correctly anymore, or you were working around apparent mistakes, please see issue \#203 in the github tracker. When in doubt, use kwargs.
  - The 'symlog' scale had some bad behavior in previous versions. This has now been fixed and users should now be able to use it without frustrations. The fixes did result in some minor changes in appearance for some users who may have been depending on the bad behavior.
  - There is now a common set of markers for all plotting functions. Previously, some markers existed only for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.scatter</span> or just for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.plot</span>. This is now no longer the case. This merge did result in a conflict. The string 'd' now means "thin diamond" while 'D' will mean "regular diamond".

api_changes_1.2.x.md

# API Changes in 1.2.x

  - The `classic` option of the rc parameter `toolbar` is deprecated and will be removed in the next release.

  - The `matplotlib.cbook.isvector` method has been removed since it is no longer functional.

  - The `rasterization_zorder` property on <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> sets a zorder below which artists are rasterized. This has defaulted to -30000.0, but it now defaults to *None*, meaning no artists will be rasterized. In order to rasterize artists below a given zorder value, <span class="title-ref">.set\_rasterization\_zorder</span> must be explicitly called.

  - In <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.scatter</span>, when specifying a marker using a tuple, the angle is now specified in degrees, not radians.

  - Using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.twinx</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.twiny</span> no longer overrides the current locaters and formatters on the axes.

  - In <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.contourf</span>, the handling of the *extend* kwarg has changed. Formerly, the extended ranges were mapped after to 0, 1 after being normed, so that they always corresponded to the extreme values of the colormap. Now they are mapped outside this range so that they correspond to the special colormap values determined by the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.Colormap.set\_under</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.Colormap.set\_over</span> methods, which default to the colormap end points.

  - The new rc parameter `savefig.format` replaces `cairo.format` and `savefig.extension`, and sets the default file format used by <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure.savefig</span>.

  - In <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.pie</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.pie</span>, one can now set the radius of the pie; setting the *radius* to 'None' (the default value), will result in a pie with a radius of 1 as before.

  - Use of `matplotlib.projections.projection_factory` is now deprecated in favour of axes class identification using `matplotlib.projections.process_projection_requirements` followed by direct axes class invocation (at the time of writing, functions which do this are: <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.add\_axes</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.add\_subplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.gca</span>). Therefore:
    
        key = figure._make_key(*args, **kwargs)
        ispolar = kwargs.pop('polar', False)
        projection = kwargs.pop('projection', None)
        if ispolar:
            if projection is not None and projection != 'polar':
                raise ValueError('polar and projection args are inconsistent')
            projection = 'polar'
        ax = projection_factory(projection, self, rect, **kwargs)
        key = self._make_key(*args, **kwargs)
        
        # is now
        
        projection_class, kwargs, key = \
                           process_projection_requirements(self, *args, **kwargs)
        ax = projection_class(self, rect, **kwargs)
    
    This change means that third party objects can expose themselves as Matplotlib axes by providing a `_as_mpl_axes` method. See `matplotlib.projections` for more detail.

  - A new keyword *extendfrac* in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase</span> allows one to control the size of the triangular minimum and maximum extensions on colorbars.

  - A new keyword *capthick* in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar</span> has been added as an intuitive alias to the *markeredgewidth* and *mew* keyword arguments, which indirectly controlled the thickness of the caps on the errorbars. For backwards compatibility, specifying either of the original keyword arguments will override any value provided by *capthick*.

  - Transform subclassing behaviour is now subtly changed. If your transform implements a non-affine transformation, then it should override the `transform_non_affine` method, rather than the generic `transform` method. Previously transforms would define `transform` and then copy the method into `transform_non_affine`:
    
        class MyTransform(mtrans.Transform):
            def transform(self, xy):
                ...
            transform_non_affine = transform
    
    This approach will no longer function correctly and should be changed to:
    
        class MyTransform(mtrans.Transform):
            def transform_non_affine(self, xy):
                ...

  - Artists no longer have `x_isdata` or `y_isdata` attributes; instead any artist's transform can be interrogated with `artist_instance.get_transform().contains_branch(ax.transData)`

  - Lines added to an axes now take into account their transform when updating the data and view limits. This means transforms can now be used as a pre-transform. For instance:
    
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> import matplotlib.transforms as mtrans
        >>> ax = plt.axes()
        >>> ax.plot(range(10), transform=mtrans.Affine2D().scale(10) + ax.transData)
        >>> print(ax.viewLim)
        Bbox('array([[  0.,   0.],\n       [ 90.,  90.]])')

  - One can now easily get a transform which goes from one transform's coordinate system to another, in an optimized way, using the new subtract method on a transform. For instance, to go from data coordinates to axes coordinates:
    
        >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
        >>> ax = plt.axes()
        >>> data2ax = ax.transData - ax.transAxes
        >>> print(ax.transData.depth, ax.transAxes.depth)
        3, 1
        >>> print(data2ax.depth)
        2
    
    for versions before 1.2 this could only be achieved in a sub-optimal way, using `ax.transData + ax.transAxes.inverted()` (depth is a new concept, but had it existed it would return 4 for this example).

  - `twinx` and `twiny` now returns an instance of SubplotBase if parent axes is an instance of SubplotBase.

  - All Qt3-based backends are now deprecated due to the lack of py3k bindings. Qt and QtAgg backends will continue to work in v1.2.x for py2.6 and py2.7. It is anticipated that the Qt3 support will be completely removed for the next release.

  - `matplotlib.colors.ColorConverter`, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.Normalize</span> now subclasses `object`

  - ContourSet instances no longer have a `transform` attribute. Instead, access the transform with the `get_transform` method.

# API Changes in 1.3.x

## Changes in 1.3.1

It is rare that we make an API change in a micro release, however, for 1.3.1 since 1.3.0 the following change was made:

  - `text.Text.cached` (used to cache font objects) has been made into a private variable. Among the obvious encapsulation benefit, this removes this confusing-looking member from the documentation.
  - The method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist</span> now always returns bin occupancies as an array of type <span class="title-ref">float</span>. Previously, it was sometimes an array of type <span class="title-ref">int</span>, depending on the call.

## Code removal

  - The following items that were deprecated in version 1.2 or earlier have now been removed completely.
      - The Qt 3.x backends (`qt` and `qtagg`) have been removed in favor of the Qt 4.x backends (`qt4` and `qt4agg`).
    
      - The FltkAgg and Emf backends have been removed.
    
      - The `matplotlib.nxutils` module has been removed. Use the functionality on <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.path.Path.contains\_point</span> and friends instead.
    
      - Instead of `axes.Axes.get_frame`, use `axes.Axes.patch`.
    
      - The following keyword arguments to the <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.legend</span> function have been renamed:
        
          - *pad* -\> *borderpad*
          - *labelsep* -\> *labelspacing*
          - *handlelen* -\> *handlelength*
          - *handletextsep* -\> *handletextpad*
          - *axespad* -\> *borderaxespad*
        
        Related to this, the following rcParams have been removed:
        
          - `legend.pad`,
          - `legend.labelsep`,
          - `legend.handlelen`,
          - `legend.handletextsep` and
          - `legend.axespad`
    
      - For the <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.hist</span> function, instead of *width*, use *rwidth* (relative width).
    
      - On <span class="title-ref">.patches.Circle</span>, the *resolution* keyword argument has been removed. For a circle made up of line segments, use <span class="title-ref">.patches.CirclePolygon</span>.
    
      - The printing functions in the Wx backend have been removed due to the burden of keeping them up-to-date.
    
      - `mlab.liaupunov` has been removed.
    
      - `mlab.save`, `mlab.load`, `pylab.save` and `pylab.load` have been removed. We recommend using <span class="title-ref">numpy.savetxt</span> and <span class="title-ref">numpy.loadtxt</span> instead.
    
      - `widgets.HorizontalSpanSelector` has been removed. Use <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SpanSelector</span> instead.

## Code deprecation

  - The CocoaAgg backend has been deprecated, with the possibility for deletion or resurrection in a future release.
  - The top-level functions in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.path</span> that are implemented in C++ were never meant to be public. Instead, users should use the Pythonic wrappers for them in the <span class="title-ref">.path.Path</span> and <span class="title-ref">.collections.Collection</span> classes. Use the following mapping to update your code:
      - `point_in_path` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.contains\_point</span>
      - `get_path_extents` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.get\_extents</span>
      - `point_in_path_collection` -\> <span class="title-ref">.collections.Collection.contains</span>
      - `path_in_path` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.contains\_path</span>
      - `path_intersects_path` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.intersects\_path</span>
      - `convert_path_to_polygons` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.to\_polygons</span>
      - `cleanup_path` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.cleaned</span>
      - `points_in_path` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.contains\_points</span>
      - `clip_path_to_rect` -\> <span class="title-ref">.path.Path.clip\_to\_bbox</span>
  - `matplotlib.colors.normalize` and `matplotlib.colors.no_norm` have been deprecated in favour of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Normalize</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.NoNorm</span> respectively.
  - The <span class="title-ref">.ScalarMappable</span> class' `set_colorbar` method is now deprecated. Instead, the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable.colorbar</span> attribute should be used. In previous Matplotlib versions this attribute was an undocumented tuple of `(colorbar_instance, colorbar_axes)` but is now just `colorbar_instance`. To get the colorbar axes it is possible to just use the `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.ax` attribute on a colorbar instance.
  - The `matplotlib.mpl` module is now deprecated. Those who relied on this module should transition to simply using `import matplotlib as mpl`.

## Code changes

  - <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> now fully supports using RGBA values for its `facecolor` and `edgecolor` attributes, which enables faces and edges to have different alpha values. If the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> object's `alpha` attribute is set to anything other than `None`, that value will override any alpha-channel value in both the face and edge colors. Previously, if <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> had `alpha=None`, the alpha component of `edgecolor` would be applied to both the edge and face.

  - The optional `isRGB` argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase.set\_foreground</span> (and the other GraphicsContext classes that descend from it) has been renamed to `isRGBA`, and should now only be set to `True` if the `fg` color argument is known to be an RGBA tuple.

  - For <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span>, the `capstyle` used is now `butt`, to be consistent with the default for most other objects, and to avoid problems with non-solid `linestyle` appearing solid when using a large `linewidth`. Previously, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> used `capstyle='projecting'`.

  - <span class="title-ref">.Path</span> objects can now be marked as *readonly* by passing `readonly=True` to its constructor. The built-in path singletons, obtained through `Path.unit*` class methods return readonly paths. If you have code that modified these, you will need to make a deepcopy first, using either:
    
        import copy
        path = copy.deepcopy(Path.unit_circle())
        
        # or
        
        path = Path.unit_circle().deepcopy()
    
    Deep copying a <span class="title-ref">.Path</span> always creates an editable (i.e. non-readonly) <span class="title-ref">.Path</span>.

  - The list at `Path.NUM_VERTICES` was replaced by a dictionary mapping Path codes to the number of expected vertices at <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.path.Path.NUM\_VERTICES\_FOR\_CODE</span>.

  - To support XKCD style plots, the `matplotlib.path.cleanup_path` method's signature was updated to require a sketch argument. Users of `matplotlib.path.cleanup_path` are encouraged to use the new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.path.Path.cleaned</span> Path method.

  - Data limits on a plot now start from a state of having "null" limits, rather than limits in the range (0, 1). This has an effect on artists that only control limits in one direction, such as <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.axvline</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.axhline</span>, since their limits will no longer also include the range (0, 1). This fixes some problems where the computed limits would be dependent on the order in which artists were added to the axes.

  - Fixed a bug in setting the position for the right/top spine with data position type. Previously, it would draw the right or top spine at +1 data offset.

  - In <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.FancyArrow</span>, the default arrow head width, `head_width`, has been made larger to produce a visible arrow head. The new value of this kwarg is `head_width = 20 * width`.

  - It is now possible to provide `number of levels + 1` colors in the case of `extend='both'` for contourf (or just `number of levels` colors for an extend value `min` or `max`) such that the resulting colormap's `set_under` and `set_over` are defined appropriately. Any other number of colors will continue to behave as before (if more colors are provided than levels, the colors will be unused). A similar change has been applied to contour, where `extend='both'` would expect `number of levels + 2` colors.

  - A new keyword *extendrect* in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase</span> allows one to control the shape of colorbar extensions.

  - The extension of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.MultiCursor</span> to both vertical (default) and/or horizontal cursor implied that `self.line` is replaced by `self.vline` for vertical cursors lines and `self.hline` is added for the horizontal cursors lines.

  - On POSIX platforms, the `matplotlib.cbook.report_memory` function raises <span class="title-ref">NotImplementedError</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">OSError</span> if the `ps` command cannot be run.

  - The `matplotlib.cbook.check_output` function has been moved to `matplotlib.compat.subprocess`.

## Configuration and rcParams

  - On Linux, the user-specific `matplotlibrc` configuration file is now located in `~/.config/matplotlib/matplotlibrc` to conform to the [XDG Base Directory Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html).
  - The `font.*` rcParams now affect only text objects created after the rcParam has been set, and will not retroactively affect already existing text objects. This brings their behavior in line with most other rcParams.
  - Removed call of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.grid</span> in `matplotlib.pyplot.plotfile`. To draw the axes grid, set the `axes.grid` rcParam to *True*, or explicitly call <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.grid</span>.

# API Changes in 1.4.x

## Code changes

  - A major refactoring of the axes module was made. The axes module has been split into smaller modules:
    
      - the `_base` module, which contains a new private `_AxesBase` class. This class contains all methods except plotting and labelling methods.
      - the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes</span> module, which contains the <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes</span> class. This class inherits from `_AxesBase`, and contains all plotting and labelling methods.
      - the `_subplot` module, with all the classes concerning subplotting.
    
    There are a couple of things that do not exists in the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes</span> module's namespace anymore. If you use them, you need to import them from their original location:
    
      - `math` -\> `import math`
      - `ma` -\> `from numpy import ma`
      - `cbook` -\> `from matplotlib import cbook`
      - `docstring` -\> `from matplotlib import docstring`
      - `is_sequence_of_strings` -\> `from matplotlib.cbook import is_sequence_of_strings`
      - `is_string_like` -\> `from matplotlib.cbook import is_string_like`
      - `iterable` -\> `from matplotlib.cbook import iterable`
      - `itertools` -\> `import itertools`
      - `martist` -\> `from matplotlib import artist as martist`
      - `matplotlib` -\> `import matplotlib`

      - `mtable` -\> `from matplotlib import table as mtable`

  - As part of the refactoring to enable Qt5 support, the module `matplotlib.backends.qt4_compat` was renamed to `matplotlib.backends.qt_compat`. `qt4_compat` is deprecated in 1.4 and will be removed in 1.5.

  - The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar</span> method has been changed such that the upper and lower limits (*lolims*, *uplims*, *xlolims*, *xuplims*) now point in the correct direction.

  - The *fmt* kwarg for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar</span> now supports the string 'none' to suppress drawing of a line and markers; use of the *None* object for this is deprecated. The default *fmt* value is changed to the empty string (''), so the line and markers are governed by the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.plot</span> defaults.

  - A bug has been fixed in the path effects rendering of fonts, which now means that the font size is consistent with non-path effect fonts. See <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/2889> for more detail.

  - The Sphinx extensions `ipython_directive` and `ipython_console_highlighting` have been moved to the IPython project itself. While they remain in Matplotlib for this release, they have been deprecated. Update your extensions in `conf.py` to point to `IPython.sphinxext.ipython_directive` instead of `matplotlib.sphinxext.ipython_directive`.

  - In `matplotlib.finance`, almost all functions have been deprecated and replaced with a pair of functions name `*_ochl` and `*_ohlc`. The former is the 'open-close-high-low' order of quotes used previously in this module, and the latter is the 'open-high-low-close' order that is standard in finance.

  - For consistency the `face_alpha` keyword to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patheffects.SimplePatchShadow</span> has been deprecated in favour of the `alpha` keyword. Similarly, the keyword `offset_xy` is now named `offset` across all <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patheffects.AbstractPathEffect</span>s. `matplotlib.patheffects._Base` has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patheffects.AbstractPathEffect</span>. `matplotlib.patheffect.ProxyRenderer` has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patheffects.PathEffectRenderer</span> and is now a full RendererBase subclass.

  - The artist used to draw the outline of a <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> has been changed from a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patches.Polygon</span>, thus `colorbar.ColorbarBase.outline` is now a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patches.Polygon</span> object.

  - The legend handler interface has changed from a callable, to any object which implements the `legend_artists` method (a deprecation phase will see this interface be maintained for v1.4). See \[legend\_guide\](\#legend\_guide) for further details. Further legend changes include:
    
      - `matplotlib.axes.Axes._get_legend_handles` now returns a generator of handles, rather than a list.
      - The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.legend</span> function's *loc* positional argument has been deprecated. Use the *loc* keyword argument instead.

  - The `savefig.transparent` has been added to control default transparency when saving figures.

  - Slightly refactored the <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> family. The text location in <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> is now entirely handled by the underlying <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> object so `.set_position` works as expected. The attributes *xytext* and *textcoords* have been deprecated in favor of *xyann* and *anncoords* so that <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> and <span class="title-ref">.AnnotationBbox</span> can share a common sensibly named api for getting/setting the location of the text or box.
    
      - *xyann* -\> set the location of the annotation
      - *xy* -\> set where the arrow points to
      - *anncoords* -\> set the units of the annotation location
      - *xycoords* -\> set the units of the point location
      - `set_position()` -\> <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> only set location of annotation

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.specgram</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.psd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.csd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.cohere</span>, `matplotlib.mlab.cohere_pairs`, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.specgram</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.psd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.csd</span>, and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.cohere</span> now raise ValueError where they previously raised AssertionError.

  - For <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.psd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.csd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.cohere</span>, `matplotlib.mlab.cohere_pairs`, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.specgram</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.psd</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.csd</span>, and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.cohere</span>, in cases where a shape (n, 1) array is returned, this is now converted to a (n, ) array. Previously, (n, m) arrays were averaged to an (n, ) array, but (n, 1) arrays were returned unchanged. This change makes the dimensions consistent in both cases.

  - Added the `axes.formatter.useoffset` to control the default value of *useOffset* in <span class="title-ref">.ticker.ScalarFormatter</span>

  - Added <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span> sub-class <span class="title-ref">.StrMethodFormatter</span> which does the exact same thing as <span class="title-ref">.FormatStrFormatter</span>, but for new-style formatting strings.

  - Deprecated `matplotlib.testing.image_util` and the only function within, `matplotlib.testing.image_util.autocontrast`. These will be removed completely in v1.5.0.

  - The `fmt` argument of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot\_date</span> has been changed from `bo` to just `o`, so color cycling can happen by default.

  - Removed the class `FigureManagerQTAgg` and deprecated `NavigationToolbar2QTAgg` which will be removed in 1.5.

  - Removed formerly public (non-prefixed) attributes `rect` and `drawRect` from `FigureCanvasQTAgg`; they were always an implementation detail of the (preserved) `drawRectangle()` function.

  - The function signatures of `matplotlib.tight_bbox.adjust_bbox` and `matplotlib.tight_bbox.process_figure_for_rasterizing` have been changed. A new *fixed\_dpi* parameter allows for overriding the `figure.dpi` setting instead of trying to deduce the intended behaviour from the file format.

  - Added support for horizontal/vertical axes padding to <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span> --- argument *axes\_pad* can now be tuple-like if separate axis padding is required. The original behavior is preserved.

  - Added support for skewed transforms to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.transforms.Affine2D</span>, which can be created using the <span class="title-ref">\~.Affine2D.skew</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Affine2D.skew\_deg</span> methods.

  - Added clockwise parameter to control sectors direction in <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.pie</span>

  - In <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> the *markevery* functionality has been extended. Previously an integer start-index and stride-length could be specified using either a two-element-list or a two-element-tuple. Now this can only be done using a two-element-tuple. If a two-element-list is used then it will be treated as NumPy fancy indexing and only the two markers corresponding to the given indexes will be shown.

  - Removed *prop* keyword argument from <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.anchored\_artists.AnchoredSizeBar</span> call. It was passed through to the base-class `__init__` and is only used for setting padding. Now *fontproperties* (which is what is really used to set the font properties of <span class="title-ref">.AnchoredSizeBar</span>) is passed through in place of *prop*. If *fontproperties* is not passed in, but *prop* is, then *prop* is used in place of *fontproperties*. If both are passed in, *prop* is silently ignored.

  - The use of the index 0 in <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> and related commands is deprecated. Due to a lack of validation, calling `plt.subplots(2, 2, 0)` does not raise an exception, but puts an axes in the \_[last]() position. This is due to the indexing in subplot being 1-based (to mirror MATLAB) so before indexing into the <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> object used to determine where the axes should go, 1 is subtracted off. Passing in 0 results in passing -1 to <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> which results in getting the last position back. Even though this behavior is clearly wrong and not intended, we are going through a deprecation cycle in an abundance of caution that any users are exploiting this 'feature'. The use of 0 as an index will raise a warning in 1.4 and an exception in 1.5.

  - Clipping is now off by default on offset boxes.

  - Matplotlib now uses a less-aggressive call to `gc.collect(1)` when closing figures to avoid major delays with large numbers of user objects in memory.

  - The default clip value of *all* pie artists now defaults to `False`.

## Code removal

  - Removed `mlab.levypdf`. The code raised a NumPy error (and has for a long time) and was not the standard form of the Levy distribution. `scipy.stats.levy` should be used instead

# API Changes in 1.5.0

## Code Changes

### Reversed <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.ls\_mapper</span>, added <span class="title-ref">.ls\_mapper\_r</span>

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.ls\_mapper</span> was a dictionary with the long-form line-style names (`"solid"`) as keys and the short forms (`"-"`) as values. This long-to-short mapping is now done by <span class="title-ref">.ls\_mapper\_r</span>, and the short-to-long mapping is done by the <span class="title-ref">.ls\_mapper</span>.

### Prevent moving artists between Axes, Property-ify Artist.axes, deprecate Artist.{get,set}\_axes

This was done to prevent an Artist that is already associated with an Axes from being moved/added to a different Axes. This was never supported as it causes havoc with the transform stack. The apparent support for this (as it did not raise an exception) was the source of multiple bug reports and questions on SO.

For almost all use-cases, the assignment of the axes to an artist should be taken care of by the axes as part of the `Axes.add_*` method, hence the deprecation of {get,set}\_axes.

Removing the `set_axes` method will also remove the 'axes' line from the ACCEPTS kwarg tables (assuming that the removal date gets here before that gets overhauled).

### Tightened input validation on 'pivot' kwarg to quiver

Tightened validation so that only {'tip', 'tail', 'mid', and 'middle'} (but any capitalization) are valid values for the *pivot* keyword argument in the <span class="title-ref">.Quiver</span> class (and hence <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.quiver</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.quiver</span> which both fully delegate to <span class="title-ref">.Quiver</span>). Previously any input matching 'mid.*' would be interpreted as 'middle', 'tip.*' as 'tip' and any string not matching one of those patterns as 'tail'.

The value of `Quiver.pivot` is normalized to be in the set {'tip', 'tail', 'middle'} in <span class="title-ref">.Quiver</span>.

### Reordered `Axes.get_children`

The artist order returned by <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.get\_children</span> did not match the one used by <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.draw</span>. They now use the same order, as <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.draw</span> now calls <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.get\_children</span>.

### Changed behaviour of contour plots

The default behaviour of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contour</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span> when using a masked array is now determined by the new keyword argument *corner\_mask*, or if this is not specified then the new `contour.corner_mask` instead. The new default behaviour is equivalent to using `corner_mask=True`; the previous behaviour can be obtained using `corner_mask=False` or by changing the rcParam. The example <https://matplotlib.org/examples/pylab_examples/contour_corner_mask.html> demonstrates the difference. Use of the old contouring algorithm, which is obtained with `corner_mask='legacy'`, is now deprecated.

Contour labels may now appear in different places than in earlier versions of Matplotlib.

In addition, the keyword argument *nchunk* now applies to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contour</span> as well as <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span>, and it subdivides the domain into subdomains of exactly *nchunk* by *nchunk* quads, whereas previously it was only roughly *nchunk* by *nchunk* quads.

The C/C++ object that performs contour calculations used to be stored in the public attribute `QuadContourSet.Cntr`, but is now stored in a private attribute and should not be accessed by end users.

### Added set\_params function to all Locator types

This was a bug fix targeted at making the api for Locators more consistent.

In the old behavior, only locators of type MaxNLocator have set\_params() defined, causing its use on any other Locator to raise an AttributeError *( aside: set\_params(args) is a function that sets the parameters of a Locator instance to be as specified within args)*. The fix involves moving set\_params() to the Locator class such that all subtypes will have this function defined.

Since each of the Locator subtypes have their own modifiable parameters, a universal set\_params() in Locator isn't ideal. Instead, a default no-operation function that raises a warning is implemented in Locator. Subtypes extending Locator will then override with their own implementations. Subtypes that do not have a need for set\_params() will fall back onto their parent's implementation, which raises a warning as intended.

In the new behavior, Locator instances will not raise an AttributeError when set\_params() is called. For Locators that do not implement set\_params(), the default implementation in Locator is used.

### Disallow `None` as x or y value in ax.plot

Do not allow `None` as a valid input for the `x` or `y` args in <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.plot</span>. This may break some user code, but this was never officially supported (ex documented) and allowing `None` objects through can lead to confusing exceptions downstream.

To create an empty line use :

    ln1, = ax.plot([], [], ...)
    ln2, = ax.plot([], ...)

In either case to update the data in the <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> object you must update both the `x` and `y` data.

### Removed *args* and *kwargs* from `MicrosecondLocator.__call__`

The call signature of `matplotlib.dates.MicrosecondLocator.__call__` has changed from `__call__(self, *args, **kwargs)` to `__call__(self)`. This is consistent with the superclass <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator</span> and also all the other Locators derived from this superclass.

### No <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> for the MicrosecondLocator and YearLocator

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.dates.MicrosecondLocator</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.dates.YearLocator</span> objects when called will return an empty list if the axes have no data or the view has no interval. Previously, they raised a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>. This is consistent with all the Date Locators.

### 'OffsetBox.DrawingArea' respects the 'clip' keyword argument

The call signature was `OffsetBox.DrawingArea(..., clip=True)` but nothing was done with the *clip* argument. The object did not do any clipping regardless of that parameter. Now the object can and does clip the child <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s if they are set to be clipped.

You can turn off the clipping on a per-child basis using `child.set_clip_on(False)`.

### Add salt to clipPath id

Add salt to the hash used to determine the id of the `clipPath` nodes. This is to avoid conflicts when two svg documents with the same clip path are included in the same document (see <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/8133> and <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/4349> ), however this means that the svg output is no longer deterministic if the same figure is saved twice. It is not expected that this will affect any users as the current ids are generated from an md5 hash of properties of the clip path and any user would have a very difficult time anticipating the value of the id.

### Changed snap threshold for circle markers to inf

When drawing circle markers above some marker size (previously 6.0) the path used to generate the marker was snapped to pixel centers. However, this ends up distorting the marker away from a circle. By setting the snap threshold to inf snapping is never done on circles.

This change broke several tests, but is an improvement.

### Preserve units with Text position

Previously the 'get\_position' method on Text would strip away unit information even though the units were still present. There was no inherent need to do this, so it has been changed so that unit data (if present) will be preserved. Essentially a call to 'get\_position' will return the exact value from a call to 'set\_position'.

If you wish to get the old behaviour, then you can use the new method called 'get\_unitless\_position'.

### New API for custom Axes view changes

Interactive pan and zoom were previously implemented using a Cartesian-specific algorithm that was not necessarily applicable to custom Axes. Three new private methods, `matplotlib.axes._base._AxesBase._get_view`, `matplotlib.axes._base._AxesBase._set_view`, and `matplotlib.axes._base._AxesBase._set_view_from_bbox`, allow for custom *Axes* classes to override the pan and zoom algorithms. Implementors of custom *Axes* who override these methods may provide suitable behaviour for both pan and zoom as well as the view navigation buttons on the interactive toolbars.

## MathTex visual changes

The spacing commands in mathtext have been changed to more closely match vanilla TeX.

### Improved spacing in mathtext

The extra space that appeared after subscripts and superscripts has been removed.

### No annotation coordinates wrap

In \#2351 for 1.4.0 the behavior of \['axes points', 'axes pixel', 'figure points', 'figure pixel'\] as coordinates was change to no longer wrap for negative values. In 1.4.3 this change was reverted for 'axes points' and 'axes pixel' and in addition caused 'axes fraction' to wrap. For 1.5 the behavior has been reverted to as it was in 1.4.0-1.4.2, no wrapping for any type of coordinate.

## Deprecation

### Deprecated `GraphicsContextBase.set_graylevel`

The `GraphicsContextBase.set_graylevel` function has been deprecated in 1.5 and will be removed in 1.6. It has been unused. The <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase.set\_foreground</span> could be used instead.

### deprecated idle\_event

The `idle_event` was broken or missing in most backends and causes spurious warnings in some cases, and its use in creating animations is now obsolete due to the animations module. Therefore code involving it has been removed from all but the wx backend (where it partially works), and its use is deprecated. The <span class="title-ref">.animation</span> module may be used instead to create animations.

### `color_cycle` deprecated

In light of the new property cycling feature, the Axes method `set_color_cycle` is now deprecated. Calling this method will replace the current property cycle with one that cycles just the given colors.

Similarly, the rc parameter *axes.color\_cycle* is also deprecated in lieu of the new `axes.prop_cycle` parameter. Having both parameters in the same rc file is not recommended as the result cannot be predicted. For compatibility, setting *axes.color\_cycle* will replace the cycler in `axes.prop_cycle` with a color cycle. Accessing *axes.color\_cycle* will return just the color portion of the property cycle, if it exists.

Timeline for removal has not been set.

## Bundled jquery

The version of jquery bundled with the webagg backend has been upgraded from 1.7.1 to 1.11.3. If you are using the version of jquery bundled with webagg you will need to update your html files as such

`` `diff    -    <script src="_static/jquery/js/jquery-1.7.1.min.js"></script>    +    <script src="_static/jquery/js/jquery-1.11.3.min.js"></script>   Code Removed ``\` ------------

### Removed `Image` from main namespace

`Image` was imported from PIL/pillow to test if PIL is available, but there is no reason to keep `Image` in the namespace once the availability has been determined.

### Removed `lod` from Artist

Removed the method `set_lod` and all references to the attribute `_lod` as they are not used anywhere else in the code base. It appears to be a feature stub that was never built out.

### Removed threading related classes from cbook

The classes `Scheduler`, `Timeout`, and `Idle` were in cbook, but are not used internally. They appear to be a prototype for the idle event system which was not working and has recently been pulled out.

### Removed *Lena* images from sample\_data

The `lena.png` and `lena.jpg` images have been removed from Matplotlib's sample\_data directory. The images are also no longer available from <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.get\_sample\_data</span>. We suggest using `matplotlib.cbook.get_sample_data('grace_hopper.png')` or `matplotlib.cbook.get_sample_data('grace_hopper.jpg')` instead.

### Legend

Removed handling of *loc* as a positional argument to <span class="title-ref">.Legend</span>

### Legend handlers

Remove code to allow legend handlers to be callable. They must now implement a method `legend_artist`.

### Axis

Removed method `set_scale`. This is now handled via a private method which should not be used directly by users. It is called via `Axes.set_{x,y}scale` which takes care of ensuring the related changes are also made to the Axes object.

### finance.py

Removed functions with ambiguous argument order from finance.py

### Annotation

Removed `textcoords` and `xytext` proprieties from Annotation objects.

### [sphinxext.ipython]()\*.py

Both `ipython_console_highlighting` and `ipython_directive` have been moved to IPython.

Change your import from `matplotlib.sphinxext.ipython_directive` to `IPython.sphinxext.ipython_directive` and from `matplotlib.sphinxext.ipython_directive` to `IPython.sphinxext.ipython_directive`

### LineCollection.color

Deprecated in 2005, use `set_color`

### remove `'faceted'` as a valid value for *shading* in `tri.tripcolor`

Use *edgecolor* instead. Added validation on *shading* to only be valid values.

### Remove `faceted` kwarg from scatter

Remove support for the `faceted` kwarg. This was deprecated in d48b34288e9651ff95c3b8a071ef5ac5cf50bae7 (2008-04-18\!) and replaced by `edgecolor`.

### Remove `set_colorbar` method from `ScalarMappable`

Remove `set_colorbar` method, use <span class="title-ref">\~.cm.ScalarMappable.colorbar</span> attribute directly.

### patheffects.svg

  - remove `get_proxy_renderer` method from `AbstractPathEffect` class
  - remove `patch_alpha` and `offset_xy` from `SimplePatchShadow`

### Remove `testing.image_util.py`

Contained only a no-longer used port of functionality from PIL

### Remove `mlab.FIFOBuffer`

Not used internally and not part of core mission of mpl.

### Remove `mlab.prepca`

Deprecated in 2009.

### Remove `NavigationToolbar2QTAgg`

Added no functionality over the base `NavigationToolbar2Qt`

### mpl.py

Remove the module `matplotlib.mpl`. Deprecated in 1.3 by PR \#1670 and commit 78ce67d161625833cacff23cfe5d74920248c5b2

# API Changes in 1.5.2

## Default Behavior Changes

### Changed default `autorange` behavior in boxplots

Prior to v1.5.2, the whiskers of boxplots would extend to the minimum and maximum values if the quartiles were all equal (i.e., Q1 = median = Q3). This behavior has been disabled by default to restore consistency with other plotting packages.

To restore the old behavior, simply set `autorange=True` when calling `plt.boxplot`.

# API Changes in 1.5.3

## `ax.plot(..., marker=None)` gives default marker

Prior to 1.5.3 keyword arguments passed to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span> were handled in two parts -- default keyword arguments generated internal to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span> (such as the cycled styles) and user supplied keyword arguments. The internally generated keyword arguments were passed to the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> and the user keyword arguments were passed to `ln.set(**kwargs)` to update the artist after it was created. Now both sets of keyword arguments are merged and passed to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span>. This change was made to allow *None* to be passed in via the user keyword arguments to mean 'do the default thing' as is the convention through out Matplotlib rather than raising an exception.

Unlike most <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> setter methods <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D.set\_marker</span> did accept <span class="title-ref">None</span> as a valid input which was mapped to 'no marker'. Thus, by routing this `marker=None` through `__init__` rather than `set(...)` the meaning of `ax.plot(..., marker=None)` changed from 'no markers' to 'default markers from rcparams'.

This is change is only evident if `mpl.rcParams['lines.marker']` has a value other than `'None'` (which is string `'None'` which means 'no marker').

api_changes_2.0.0.md

# API Changes in 2.0.0

## Deprecation and removal

### Color of Axes

The `axisbg` and `axis_bgcolor` properties on *Axes* have been deprecated in favor of `facecolor`.

### GTK and GDK backends deprecated

The GDK and GTK backends have been deprecated. These obsolete backends allow figures to be rendered via the GDK API to files and GTK2 figures. They are untested and known to be broken, and their use has been discouraged for some time. Instead, use the `GTKAgg` and `GTKCairo` backends for rendering to GTK2 windows.

### WX backend deprecated

The WX backend has been deprecated. It is untested, and its use has been discouraged for some time. Instead, use the `WXAgg` backend for rendering figures to WX windows.

### CocoaAgg backend removed

The deprecated and not fully functional CocoaAgg backend has been removed.

### <span class="title-ref">round</span> removed from TkAgg Backend

The TkAgg backend had its own implementation of the <span class="title-ref">round</span> function. This was unused internally and has been removed. Instead, use either the <span class="title-ref">round</span> builtin function or <span class="title-ref">numpy.around</span>.

### 'hold' functionality deprecated

The 'hold' keyword argument and all functions and methods related to it are deprecated, along with the `axes.hold` rcParams entry. The behavior will remain consistent with the default `hold=True` state that has long been in place. Instead of using a function or keyword argument (`hold=False`) to change that behavior, explicitly clear the axes or figure as needed prior to subsequent plotting commands.

## <span class="title-ref">.Artist.update</span> has return value

The methods <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.set</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.update</span>, and the function <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.setp</span> now use a common codepath to look up how to update the given artist properties (either using the setter methods or an attribute/property).

The behavior of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.update</span> is slightly changed to return a list of the values returned from the setter methods to avoid changing the API of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.set</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.setp</span>.

The keys passed into <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.update</span> are now converted to lower case before being processed, to match the behavior of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.set</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.setp</span>. This should not break any user code because there are no set methods with capitals in their names, but this puts a constraint on naming properties in the future.

## <span class="title-ref">.Legend</span> initializers gain *edgecolor* and *facecolor* keyword arguments

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.legend.Legend</span> background patch (or 'frame') can have its `edgecolor` and `facecolor` determined by the corresponding keyword arguments to the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.legend.Legend</span> initializer, or to any of the methods or functions that call that initializer. If left to their default values of <span class="title-ref">None</span>, their values will be taken from `matplotlib.rcParams`. The previously-existing `framealpha` kwarg still controls the alpha transparency of the patch.

## Qualitative colormaps

Colorbrewer's qualitative/discrete colormaps ("Accent", "Dark2", "Paired", "Pastel1", "Pastel2", "Set1", "Set2", "Set3") are now implemented as <span class="title-ref">.ListedColormap</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">.LinearSegmentedColormap</span>.

To use these for images where categories are specified as integers, for instance, use:

    plt.imshow(x, cmap='Dark2', norm=colors.NoNorm())

## Change in the `draw_image` backend API

The `draw_image` method implemented by backends has changed its interface.

This change is only relevant if the backend declares that it is able to transform images by returning `True` from `option_scale_image`. See the `draw_image` docstring for more information.

## `matplotlib.ticker.LinearLocator` algorithm update

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.LinearLocator</span> is used to define the range and location of axis ticks when the user wants an exact number of ticks. `LinearLocator` thus differs from the default locator `MaxNLocator`, for which the user specifies a maximum number of intervals rather than a precise number of ticks.

The view range algorithm in `matplotlib.ticker.LinearLocator` has been changed so that more convenient tick locations are chosen. The new algorithm returns a plot view range that is a multiple of the user-requested number of ticks. This ensures tick marks will be located at whole integers more consistently. For example, when both y-axes of a`twinx` plot use `matplotlib.ticker.LinearLocator` with the same number of ticks, their y-tick locations and grid lines will coincide.

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.LogLocator</span> gains numticks kwarg

The maximum number of ticks generated by the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.LogLocator</span> can now be controlled explicitly via setting the new 'numticks' kwarg to an integer. By default the kwarg is None which internally sets it to the 'auto' string, triggering a new algorithm for adjusting the maximum according to the axis length relative to the ticklabel font size.

## \`matplotlib.ticker.LogFormatter\`: two new kwargs

Previously, minor ticks on log-scaled axes were not labeled by default. An algorithm has been added to the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.LogFormatter</span> to control the labeling of ticks between integer powers of the base. The algorithm uses two parameters supplied in a kwarg tuple named 'minor\_thresholds'. See the docstring for further explanation.

To improve support for axes using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.SymmetricalLogLocator</span>, a *linthresh* keyword argument was added.

## New defaults for 3D quiver function in mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.py

Matplotlib has both a 2D and a 3D `quiver` function. These changes affect only the 3D function and make the default behavior of the 3D function match the 2D version. There are two changes:

1)  The 3D quiver function previously normalized the arrows to be the same length, which makes it unusable for situations where the arrows should be different lengths and does not match the behavior of the 2D function. This normalization behavior is now controlled with the `normalize` keyword, which defaults to False.
2)  The `pivot` keyword now defaults to `tail` instead of `tip`. This was done in order to match the default behavior of the 2D quiver function.

To obtain the previous behavior with the 3D quiver function, one can call the function with :

    ax.quiver(x, y, z, u, v, w, normalize=True, pivot='tip')

where "ax" is an `Axes3d` object created with something like :

    import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d
    ax = plt.subplot(111, projection='3d')

## Stale figure behavior

Attempting to draw the figure will now mark it as not stale (independent if the draw succeeds). This change is to prevent repeatedly trying to re-draw a figure which is raising an error on draw. The previous behavior would only mark a figure as not stale after a full re-draw succeeded.

## The spectral colormap is now nipy\_spectral

The colormaps formerly known as `spectral` and `spectral_r` have been replaced by `nipy_spectral` and `nipy_spectral_r` since Matplotlib 1.3.0. Even though the colormap was deprecated in Matplotlib 1.3.0, it never raised a warning. As of Matplotlib 2.0.0, using the old names raises a deprecation warning. In the future, using the old names will raise an error.

## Default install no longer includes test images

To reduce the size of wheels and source installs, the tests and baseline images are no longer included by default.

To restore installing the tests and images, use a `setup.cfg` with :

    [packages]
    tests = True
    toolkits_tests = True

in the source directory at build/install time.

# API Changes in 2.0.1

## Extensions to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span>

To better support controlling the color of hatches, the method <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase.set\_hatch\_color</span> was added to the expected API of `GraphicsContext` classes. Calls to this method are currently wrapped with a `try:...except Attribute:` block to preserve back-compatibility with any third-party backends which do not extend <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span>.

This value can be accessed in the backends via <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase.get\_hatch\_color</span> (which was added in 2.0 see \[gc\_get\_hatch\_color\_wn\](\#gc\_get\_hatch\_color\_wn)) and should be used to color the hatches.

In the future there may also be `hatch_linewidth` and `hatch_density` related methods added. It is encouraged, but not required that third-party backends extend <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span> to make adapting to these changes easier.

## `afm.get_fontconfig_fonts` returns a list of paths and does not check for existence

`afm.get_fontconfig_fonts` used to return a set of paths encoded as a `{key: 1, ...}` dict, and checked for the existence of the paths. It now returns a list and dropped the existence check, as the same check is performed by the caller (`afm.findSystemFonts`) as well.

## `bar` now returns rectangles of negative height or width if the corresponding input is negative

<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.bar</span> used to normalize the coordinates of the rectangles that it created, to keep their height and width positives, even if the corresponding input was negative. This normalization has been removed to permit a simpler computation of the correct <span class="title-ref">.Artist.sticky\_edges</span> to use.

## Do not clip line width when scaling dashes

The algorithm to scale dashes was changed to no longer clip the scaling factor: the dash patterns now continue to shrink at thin line widths. If the line width is smaller than the effective pixel size, this may result in dashed lines turning into solid gray-ish lines. This also required slightly tweaking the default patterns for '--', ':', and '.-' so that with the default line width the final patterns would not change.

There is no way to restore the old behavior.

## Deprecate 'Vega' colormaps

The "Vega" colormaps are deprecated in Matplotlib 2.0.1 and will be removed in Matplotlib 2.2. Use the "tab" colormaps instead: "tab10", "tab20", "tab20b", "tab20c".

# API Changes in 2.1.0

## Default behavior of log scales changed to mask \<= 0 values

Calling <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xscale</span> or <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_yscale</span> now uses 'mask' as the default method to handle invalid values (as opposed to 'clip'). This means that any values \<= 0 on a log scale will not be shown.

Previously they were clipped to a very small number and shown.

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry.process</span> suppresses exceptions by default

Matplotlib uses instances of `~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry` as a bridge between user input event from the GUI and user callbacks. Previously, any exceptions raised in a user call back would bubble out of the `process` method, which is typically in the GUI event loop. Most GUI frameworks simple print the traceback to the screen and continue as there is not always a clear method of getting the exception back to the user. However PyQt5 now exits the process when it receives an un-handled python exception in the event loop. Thus, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry.process</span> now suppresses and prints tracebacks to stderr by default.

What <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry.process</span> does with exceptions is now user configurable via the `exception_handler` attribute and kwarg. To restore the previous behavior pass `None` :

    cb = CallbackRegistry(exception_handler=None)

A function which take and `Exception` as its only argument may also be passed :

    def maybe_reraise(exc):
        if isinstance(exc, RuntimeError):
            pass
        else:
            raise exc
    
    cb = CallbackRegistry(exception_handler=maybe_reraise)

## Improved toggling of the axes grids

The `g` key binding now switches the states of the `x` and `y` grids independently (by cycling through all four on/off combinations).

The new `G` key binding switches the states of the minor grids.

Both bindings are disabled if only a subset of the grid lines (in either direction) is visible, to avoid making irreversible changes to the figure.

## Ticklabels are turned off instead of being invisible

Internally, the <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span>'s `~matplotlib.axis.Tick.label1On` attribute is now used to hide tick labels instead of setting the visibility on the tick label objects. This improves overall performance and fixes some issues. As a consequence, in case those labels ought to be shown, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span> needs to be used, e.g.

    ax.tick_params(labelbottom=True)

## Removal of warning on empty legends

<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.legend</span> used to issue a warning when no labeled artist could be found. This warning has been removed.

## More accurate legend autopositioning

Automatic positioning of legends now prefers using the area surrounded by a <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> rather than placing the legend over the line itself.

## Cleanup of stock sample data

The sample data of stocks has been cleaned up to remove redundancies and increase portability. The `AAPL.dat.gz`, `INTC.dat.gz` and `aapl.csv` files have been removed entirely and will also no longer be available from <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cbook.get\_sample\_data</span>. If a CSV file is required, we suggest using the `msft.csv` that continues to be shipped in the sample data. If a NumPy binary file is acceptable, we suggest using one of the following two new files. The `aapl.npy.gz` and `goog.npy` files have been replaced by `aapl.npz` and `goog.npz`, wherein the first column's type has changed from <span class="title-ref">datetime.date</span> to <span class="title-ref">numpy.datetime64</span> for better portability across Python versions. Note that Matplotlib does not fully support <span class="title-ref">numpy.datetime64</span> as yet.

## Updated qhull to 2015.2

The version of qhull shipped with Matplotlib, which is used for Delaunay triangulation, has been updated from version 2012.1 to 2015.2.

## Improved Delaunay triangulations with large offsets

Delaunay triangulations now deal with large x,y offsets in a better way. This can cause minor changes to any triangulations calculated using Matplotlib, i.e. any use of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.tri.Triangulation</span> that requests that a Delaunay triangulation is calculated, which includes <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.tricontour</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.tricontourf</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.tripcolor</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.triplot</span>, `matplotlib.mlab.griddata` and <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_trisurf</span>.

## Use `backports.functools_lru_cache` instead of `functools32`

It's better maintained and more widely used (by pylint, jaraco, etc).

## `cbook.is_numlike` only performs an instance check

`matplotlib.cbook.is_numlike` now only checks that its argument is an instance of `(numbers.Number, np.Number)`. In particular, this means that arrays are now not num-like.

## Elliptical arcs now drawn between correct angles

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patches.Arc</span> patch is now correctly drawn between the given angles.

Previously a circular arc was drawn and then stretched into an ellipse, so the resulting arc did not lie between *theta1* and *theta2*.

## `-d$backend` no longer sets the backend

It is no longer possible to set the backend by passing `-d$backend` at the command line. Use the `MPLBACKEND` environment variable instead.

## Path.intersects\_bbox always treats the bounding box as filled

Previously, when `Path.intersects_bbox` was called with `filled` set to `False`, it would treat both the path and the bounding box as unfilled. This behavior was not well documented and it is usually not the desired behavior, since bounding boxes are used to represent more complex shapes located inside the bounding box. This behavior has now been changed: when `filled` is `False`, the path will be treated as unfilled, but the bounding box is still treated as filled. The old behavior was arguably an implementation bug.

When `Path.intersects_bbox` is called with `filled` set to `True` (the default value), there is no change in behavior. For those rare cases where `Path.intersects_bbox` was called with `filled` set to `False` and where the old behavior is actually desired, the suggested workaround is to call `Path.intersects_path` with a rectangle as the path:

    from matplotlib.path import Path
    from matplotlib.transforms import Bbox, BboxTransformTo
    rect = Path.unit_rectangle().transformed(BboxTransformTo(bbox))
    result = path.intersects_path(rect, filled=False)

## WX no longer calls generates `IdleEvent` events or calls `idle_event`

Removed unused private method `_onIdle` from `FigureCanvasWx`.

The `IdleEvent` class and `FigureCanvasBase.idle_event` method will be removed in 2.2

## Correct scaling of `magnitude_spectrum()`

The functions <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab.magnitude\_spectrum()</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.magnitude\_spectrum()</span> implicitly assumed the sum of windowing function values to be one. In Matplotlib and Numpy the standard windowing functions are scaled to have maximum value of one, which usually results in a sum of the order of n/2 for a n-point signal. Thus the amplitude scaling `magnitude_spectrum()` was off by that amount when using standard windowing functions ([Bug 8417](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/8417) ). Now the behavior is consistent with <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.psd()</span> and <span class="title-ref">scipy.signal.welch()</span>. The following example demonstrates the new and old scaling:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    tau, n = 10, 1024  # 10 second signal with 1024 points
    T = tau/n  # sampling interval
    t = np.arange(n)*T
    
    a = 4  # amplitude
    x = a*np.sin(40*np.pi*t)  # 20 Hz sine with amplitude a
    
    # New correct behavior: Amplitude at 20 Hz is a/2
    plt.magnitude_spectrum(x, Fs=1/T, sides='onesided', scale='linear')
    
    # Original behavior: Amplitude at 20 Hz is (a/2)*(n/2) for a Hanning window
    w = np.hanning(n)  # default window is a Hanning window
    plt.magnitude_spectrum(x*np.sum(w), Fs=1/T, sides='onesided', scale='linear')

## Change to signatures of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar</span> & <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh</span>

For 2.0 the \[default value of *align* \<barbarh\_align\>\](\#default-value-of-*align*-\<barbarh\_align\>) changed to `'center'`. However this caused the signature of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh</span> to be misleading as the first parameters were still *left* and *bottom* respectively:

    bar(left, height, *, align='center', **kwargs)
    barh(bottom, width, *, align='center', **kwargs)

despite behaving as the center in both cases. The methods now take `*args, **kwargs` as input and are documented to have the primary signatures of:

    bar(x, height, *, align='center', **kwargs)
    barh(y, width, *, align='center', **kwargs)

Passing *left* and *bottom* as keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barh</span> respectively will warn. Support will be removed in Matplotlib 3.0.

## Font cache as json

The font cache is now saved as json, rather than a pickle.

## Invalid (Non-finite) Axis Limit Error

When using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_ylim</span>, passing non-finite values now results in a `ValueError`. The previous behavior resulted in the limits being erroneously reset to `(-0.001, 0.001)`.

## `scatter` and `Collection` offsets are no longer implicitly flattened

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.Collection</span> (and thus both 2D <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter</span> and 3D <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.scatter</span>) no longer implicitly flattens its offsets. As a consequence, `scatter`'s `x` and `y` arguments can no longer be 2+-dimensional arrays.

## Deprecations

### `GraphicsContextBase`'s `linestyle` property.

The `GraphicsContextBase.get_linestyle` and `GraphicsContextBase.set_linestyle` methods, which had no effect, have been deprecated. All of the backends Matplotlib ships use `GraphicsContextBase.get_dashes` and `GraphicsContextBase.set_dashes` which are more general. Third-party backends should also migrate to the `*_dashes` methods.

### `NavigationToolbar2.dynamic_update`

Use <span class="title-ref">\~.FigureCanvasBase.draw\_idle</span> method on the `Canvas` instance instead.

### Testing

`matplotlib.testing.noseclasses` is deprecated and will be removed in 2.3

### `EngFormatter` *num* arg as string

Passing a string as *num* argument when calling an instance of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.EngFormatter</span> is deprecated and will be removed in 2.3.

### `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` module

All functionally from `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` can be found in either <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1</span> or <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span>. Axes classes from `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` based on `Axis` from <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span> can be found in <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span>.

### `Axes` collision in `Figure.add_axes`

Adding an axes instance to a figure by using the same arguments as for a previous axes instance currently reuses the earlier instance. This behavior has been deprecated in Matplotlib 2.1. In a future version, a *new* instance will always be created and returned. Meanwhile, in such a situation, a deprecation warning is raised by `matplotlib.figure.AxesStack`.

This warning can be suppressed, and the future behavior ensured, by passing a *unique* label to each axes instance. See the docstring of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.add\_axes</span> for more information.

Additional details on the rationale behind this deprecation can be found in `7377` and `9024`.

### Former validators for `contour.negative_linestyle`

The former public validation functions `validate_negative_linestyle` and `validate_negative_linestyle_legacy` will be deprecated in 2.1 and may be removed in 2.3. There are no public functions to replace them.

### `cbook`

Many unused or near-unused `matplotlib.cbook` functions and classes have been deprecated: `converter`, `tostr`, `todatetime`, `todate`, `tofloat`, `toint`, `unique`, `is_string_like`, `is_sequence_of_strings`, `is_scalar`, `Sorter`, `Xlator`, `soundex`, `Null`, `dict_delall`, `RingBuffer`, `get_split_ind`, `wrap`, `get_recursive_filelist`, `pieces`, `exception_to_str`, `allequal`, `alltrue`, `onetrue`, `allpairs`, `finddir`, `reverse_dict`, `restrict_dict`, `issubclass_safe`, `recursive_remove`, `unmasked_index_ranges`.

## Code Removal

### qt4\_compat.py

Moved to `qt_compat.py`. Renamed because it now handles Qt5 as well.

### Previously Deprecated methods

The `GraphicsContextBase.set_graylevel`, `FigureCanvasBase.onHilite` and `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.mpl_axes.Axes.toggle_axisline` methods have been removed.

The `ArtistInspector.findobj` method, which was never working due to the lack of a `get_children` method, has been removed.

The deprecated `point_in_path`, `get_path_extents`, `point_in_path_collection`, `path_intersects_path`, `convert_path_to_polygons`, `cleanup_path` and `clip_path_to_rect` functions in the `matplotlib.path` module have been removed. Their functionality remains exposed as methods on the `Path` class.

The deprecated `Artist.get_axes` and `Artist.set_axes` methods have been removed

The `matplotlib.backends.backend_ps.seq_allequal` function has been removed. Use `np.array_equal` instead.

The deprecated `matplotlib.rcsetup.validate_maskedarray`, `matplotlib.rcsetup.deprecate_savefig_extension` and `matplotlib.rcsetup.validate_tkpythoninspect` functions, and associated `savefig.extension` and `tk.pythoninspect` rcparams entries have been removed.

The keyword argument *resolution* of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes</span> has been removed. It has deprecation with no effect from version *0.98.x*.

### `Axes.set_aspect("normal")`

Support for setting an `Axes`'s aspect to `"normal"` has been removed, in favor of the synonym `"auto"`.

### `shading` kwarg to `pcolor`

The `shading` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pcolor</span> has been removed. Set `edgecolors` appropriately instead.

### Functions removed from the `lines` module

The `matplotlib.lines` module no longer imports the `pts_to_prestep`, `pts_to_midstep` and `pts_to_poststep` functions from `matplotlib.cbook`.

### PDF backend functions

The methods `embedTeXFont` and `tex_font_mapping` of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf.PdfFile</span> have been removed. It is unlikely that external users would have called these methods, which are related to the font system internal to the PDF backend.

### matplotlib.delaunay

Remove the delaunay triangulation code which is now handled by Qhull via `matplotlib.tri`.

# API Changes in 2.1.1

## Default behavior of log scales reverted to clip \<= 0 values

The change it 2.1.0 to mask in logscale by default had more disruptive changes than anticipated and has been reverted, however the clipping is now done in a way that fixes the issues that motivated changing the default behavior to `'mask'`.

As a side effect of this change, error bars which go negative now work as expected on log scales.

---

api_changes_2.1.2.md

---

# API Changes in 2.1.2

## <span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span> no longer checks for repeated lines to ignore

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure.legend</span> used to check if a line had the same label as an existing legend entry. If it also had the same line color or marker color legend didn't add a new entry for that line. However, the list of conditions was incomplete, didn't handle RGB tuples, didn't handle linewidths or linestyles etc.

This logic did not exist in <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.legend</span>. It was included (erroneously) in Matplotlib 2.1.1 when the legend argument parsing was unified `9324`. This change removes that check in <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.legend</span> again to restore the old behavior.

This logic has also been dropped from <span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span>, where it was previously undocumented. Repeated lines with the same label will now each have an entry in the legend. If you do not want the duplicate entries, don't add a label to the line, or prepend the label with an underscore.

# API Changes in 2.2.0

## New dependency

[kiwisolver](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) is now a required dependency to support the new constrained\_layout, see \[constrainedlayout\_guide\](\#constrainedlayout\_guide) for more details.

## Deprecations

### Classes, functions, and methods

The unused and untested `Artist.onRemove` and `Artist.hitlist` methods have been deprecated.

The now unused `mlab.less_simple_linear_interpolation` function is deprecated.

The unused `ContourLabeler.get_real_label_width` method is deprecated.

The unused `FigureManagerBase.show_popup` method is deprecated. This introduced in e945059b327d42a99938b939a1be867fa023e7ba in 2005 but never built out into any of the backends.

`backend_tkagg.AxisMenu` is deprecated, as it has become unused since the removal of "classic" toolbars.

### Changed function signatures

kwarg `fig` to <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec.get\_subplot\_params</span> is deprecated, use `figure` instead.

Using <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.axes</span> with an <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> as argument is deprecated. This sets the current axes, i.e. it has the same effect as <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.sca</span>. For clarity `plt.sca(ax)` should be preferred over `plt.axes(ax)`.

Using strings instead of booleans to control grid and tick visibility is deprecated. Using `"on"`, `"off"`, `"true"`, or `"false"` to control grid and tick visibility has been deprecated. Instead, use normal booleans (`True`/`False`) or boolean-likes. In the future, all non-empty strings may be interpreted as `True`.

When given 2D inputs with non-matching numbers of columns, <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.plot</span> currently cycles through the columns of the narrower input, until all the columns of the wider input have been plotted. This behavior is deprecated; in the future, only broadcasting (1 column to *n* columns) will be performed.

### rcparams

The `backend.qt4` and `backend.qt5` rcParams were deprecated in version 2.2. In order to force the use of a specific Qt binding, either import that binding first, or set the `QT_API` environment variable.

Deprecation of the `nbagg.transparent` rcParam. To control transparency of figure patches in the nbagg (or any other) backend, directly set `figure.patch.facecolor`, or the `figure.facecolor` rcParam.

### Deprecated `Axis.unit_data`

Use `Axis.units` (which has long existed) instead.

## Removals

### Function Signatures

Contouring no longer supports `legacy` corner masking. The deprecated `ContourSet.vmin` and `ContourSet.vmax` properties have been removed.

Passing `None` instead of `"none"` as format to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.errorbar</span> is no longer supported.

The `bgcolor` keyword argument to `Axes` has been removed.

### Modules, methods, and functions

The `matplotlib.finance`, `mpl_toolkits.exceltools` and `mpl_toolkits.gtktools` modules have been removed. `matplotlib.finance` remains available at <https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl_finance>.

The `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.iscolor` function has been removed.

The `Axes.get_axis_bgcolor`, `Axes.set_axis_bgcolor`, `Bbox.update_from_data`, `Bbox.update_datalim_numerix`, `MaxNLocator.bin_boundaries` methods have been removed.

`mencoder` can no longer be used to encode animations.

The unused `FONT_SCALE` and `fontd` attributes of the <span class="title-ref">.RendererSVG</span> class have been removed.

### colormaps

The `spectral` colormap has been removed. The `Vega*` colormaps, which were aliases for the `tab*` colormaps, have been removed.

### rcparams

The following deprecated rcParams have been removed:

  - `axes.color_cycle` (see `axes.prop_cycle`),
  - `legend.isaxes`,
  - `svg.embed_char_paths` (see `svg.fonttype`),
  - `text.fontstyle`, `text.fontangle`, `text.fontvariant`, `text.fontweight`, `text.fontsize` (renamed to `text.style`, etc.),
  - `tick.size` (renamed to `tick.major.size`).

## Only accept string-like for Categorical input

Do not accept mixed string / float / int input, only strings are valid categoricals.

## Removal of unused imports

Many unused imports were removed from the codebase. As a result, trying to import certain classes or functions from the "wrong" module (e.g. <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure</span> from `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg` instead of `matplotlib.figure`) will now raise an <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span>.

## `Axes3D.get_xlim`, `get_ylim` and `get_zlim` now return a tuple

They previously returned an array. Returning a tuple is consistent with the behavior for 2D axes.

## Exception type changes

If <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriterRegistry</span> can't find the requested <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriter</span>, a more helpful <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> message is now raised instead of the previously raised <span class="title-ref">KeyError</span>.

`matplotlib.tight_layout.auto_adjust_subplotpars` now raises <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> when sizes of input lists don't match

## <span class="title-ref">.Figure.set\_figwidth</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Figure.set\_figheight</span> default *forward* to True

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure.set\_figwidth</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure.set\_figheight</span> had the keyword argument `forward=False` by default, but <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.set\_size\_inches</span> now defaults to `forward=True`. This makes these functions consistent.

## Do not truncate svg sizes to nearest point

There is no reason to size the SVG out put in integer points, change to out putting floats for the *height*, *width*, and *viewBox* attributes of the *svg* element.

## Fontsizes less than 1 pt are clipped to be 1 pt.

FreeType doesn't allow fonts to get smaller than 1 pt, so all Agg backends were silently rounding up to 1 pt. PDF (other vector backends?) were letting us write fonts that were less than 1 pt, but they could not be placed properly because position information comes from FreeType. This change makes it so no backends can use fonts smaller than 1 pt, consistent with FreeType and ensuring more consistent results across backends.

## Changes to Qt backend class MRO

To support both Agg and cairo rendering for Qt backends all of the non-Agg specific code previously in `backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAggBase` has been moved to `backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT` so it can be shared with the cairo implementation. The `FigureCanvasQTAggBase.paintEvent`, `FigureCanvasQTAggBase.blit`, and `FigureCanvasQTAggBase.print_figure` methods have moved to `FigureCanvasQTAgg.paintEvent`, `FigureCanvasQTAgg.blit`, and `FigureCanvasQTAgg.print_figure`. The first two methods assume that the instance is also a `QWidget` so to use `FigureCanvasQTAggBase` it was required to multiple inherit from a `QWidget` sub-class.

Having moved all of its methods either up or down the class hierarchy `FigureCanvasQTAggBase` has been deprecated. To do this without warning and to preserve as much API as possible, `.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAggBase` now inherits from `backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQTAgg`.

The MRO for `FigureCanvasQTAgg` and `FigureCanvasQTAggBase` used to be :

    [matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAggBase,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT,
     PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidget,
     PyQt5.QtCore.QObject,
     sip.wrapper,
     PyQt5.QtGui.QPaintDevice,
     sip.simplewrapper,
     matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase,
     object]

and :

    [matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAggBase,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg,
     matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase,
     object]

respectively. They are now :

    [matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT,
     PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidget,
     PyQt5.QtCore.QObject,
     sip.wrapper,
     PyQt5.QtGui.QPaintDevice,
     sip.simplewrapper,
     matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase,
     object]

and :

    [matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAggBase,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg.FigureCanvasQTAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_agg.FigureCanvasAgg,
     matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT,
     PyQt5.QtWidgets.QWidget,
     PyQt5.QtCore.QObject,
     sip.wrapper,
     PyQt5.QtGui.QPaintDevice,
     sip.simplewrapper,
     matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase,
     object]

## <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.imshow</span> clips RGB values to the valid range

When <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.imshow</span> is passed an RGB or RGBA value with out-of-range values, it now logs a warning and clips them to the valid range. The old behaviour, wrapping back in to the range, often hid outliers and made interpreting RGB images unreliable.

## GTKAgg and GTKCairo backends deprecated

The GTKAgg and GTKCairo backends have been deprecated. These obsolete backends allow figures to be rendered via the GTK+ 2 toolkit. They are untested, known to be broken, will not work with Python 3, and their use has been discouraged for some time. Instead, use the `GTK3Agg` and `GTK3Cairo` backends for rendering to GTK+ 3 windows.

# API Changes for 3.0.0

## Drop support for python 2

Matplotlib 3 only supports python 3.5 and higher.

## Changes to backend loading

Failure to load backend modules (`macosx` on non-framework builds and `gtk3` when running headless) now raises <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span> (instead of <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> and <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span>, respectively).

Third-party backends that integrate with an interactive framework are now encouraged to define the `required_interactive_framework` global value to one of the following values: "qt5", "qt4", "gtk3", "wx", "tk", or "macosx". This information will be used to determine whether it is possible to switch from a backend to another (specifically, whether they use the same interactive framework).

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist2d</span> now uses <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolorfast</span>

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist2d</span> now uses <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolorfast</span>, which will improve the handling of log-axes. Note that the returned *image* now is of type <span class="title-ref">\~.matplotlib.collections.QuadMesh</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">\~.matplotlib.image.AxesImage</span>.

## <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span> now includes all artists

For Matplotlib 3.0, *all* artists are now included in the bounding box returned by <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span>.

<span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span> adds a new kwarg `bbox_extra_artists` to manually specify the list of artists on the axes to include in the tight bounding box calculation.

Layout tools like <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span>, `constrained_layout`, and `fig.savefig('fname.png', bbox_inches="tight")` use <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span> to determine the bounds of each axes on a figure and adjust spacing between axes.

In Matplotlib 2.2 `get_tightbbox` started to include legends made on the axes, but still excluded some other artists, like text that may overspill an axes. This has been expanded to include *all* artists.

This new default may be overridden in either of three ways:

1.  Make the artist to be excluded a child of the figure, not the axes. E.g., call `fig.legend()` instead of `ax.legend()` (perhaps using <span class="title-ref">\~.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_legend\_handles\_labels</span> to gather handles and labels from the parent axes).
2.  If the artist is a child of the axes, set the artist property `artist.set_in_layout(False)`.
3.  Manually specify a list of artists in the new kwarg `bbox_extra_artists`.

## <span class="title-ref">.Text.set\_text</span> with string argument `None` sets string to empty

<span class="title-ref">.Text.set\_text</span> when passed a string value of `None` would set the string to `"None"`, so subsequent calls to <span class="title-ref">.Text.get\_text</span> would return the ambiguous `"None"` string.

This change sets text objects passed `None` to have empty strings, so that <span class="title-ref">.Text.get\_text</span> returns an empty string.

## `Axes3D.get_xlim`, `get_ylim` and `get_zlim` now return a tuple

They previously returned an array. Returning a tuple is consistent with the behavior for 2D axes.

## `font_manager.list_fonts` now follows the platform's casefolding semantics

i.e., it behaves case-insensitively on Windows only.

## `bar` / `barh` no longer accepts `left` / `bottom` as first named argument

These arguments were renamed in 2.0 to `x` / `y` following the change of the default alignment from `edge` to `center`.

## Different exception types for undocumented options

  - Passing `style='comma'` to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.ticklabel\_format</span> was never supported. It now raises `ValueError` like all other unsupported styles, rather than `NotImplementedError`.
  - Passing the undocumented `xmin` or `xmax` arguments to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span> would silently override the `left` and `right` arguments. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_ylim</span> and the 3D equivalents (e.g. <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.set\_zlim</span>) had a corresponding problem. A `TypeError` will be raised if they would override the earlier limit arguments. In 3.0 these were kwargs were deprecated, but in 3.1 the deprecation was undone.

## Improved call signature for `Axes.margins`

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.margins</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.margins</span> no longer accept arbitrary keywords. `TypeError` will therefore be raised if unknown kwargs are passed; previously they would be silently ignored.

If too many positional arguments are passed, `TypeError` will be raised instead of `ValueError`, for consistency with other call-signature violations.

<span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.margins</span> now raises `TypeError` instead of emitting a deprecation warning if only two positional arguments are passed. To supply only `x` and `y` margins, use keyword arguments.

## Explicit arguments instead of \*args, \*\*kwargs

[PEP 3102](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3102/ "PEP 3102") describes keyword-only arguments, which allow Matplotlib to provide explicit call signatures - where we previously used `*args, **kwargs` and `kwargs.pop`, we can now expose named arguments. In some places, unknown kwargs were previously ignored but now raise `TypeError` because `**kwargs` has been removed.

  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.stem</span> no longer accepts unknown keywords, and raises `TypeError` instead of emitting a deprecation.
  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.stem</span> now raises TypeError when passed unhandled positional arguments. If two or more arguments are passed (ie X, Y, \[linefmt\], ...) and Y cannot be cast to an array, an error will be raised instead of treating X as Y and Y as linefmt.
  - <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider.SubplotDivider</span> raises `TypeError` instead of `Exception` when passed unknown kwargs.

## Cleanup decorators and test classes no longer destroy warnings filter on exit

The decorators and classes in matplotlib.testing.decorators no longer destroy the warnings filter on exit. Instead, they restore the warnings filter that existed before the test started using `warnings.catch_warnings`.

## Non-interactive FigureManager classes are now aliases of FigureManagerBase

The `FigureManagerPdf`, `FigureManagerPS`, and `FigureManagerSVG` classes, which were previously empty subclasses of <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span> (i.e., not adding or overriding any attribute or method), are now direct aliases for <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span>.

## Change to the output of <span class="title-ref">.image.thumbnail</span>

When called with `preview=False`, <span class="title-ref">.image.thumbnail</span> previously returned an figure whose canvas class was set according to the output file extension. It now returns a figure whose canvas class is the base <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase</span> (and relies on <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase.print\_figure</span>) to handle the canvas switching properly).

As a side effect of this change, <span class="title-ref">.image.thumbnail</span> now also supports .ps, .eps, and .svgz output.

## <span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> now draws artists according to their zorder when blitting

<span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> now draws artists returned by the user-function according to their zorder when using blitting, instead of using the order in which they are being passed. However, note that only zorder of passed artists will be respected, as they are drawn on top of any existing artists (see [\#11369](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/11369)).

## Contour color autoscaling improvements

Selection of contour levels is now the same for contour and contourf; previously, for contour, levels outside the data range were deleted. (Exception: if no contour levels are found within the data range, the `levels` attribute is replaced with a list holding only the minimum of the data range.)

When contour is called with levels specified as a target number rather than a list, and the 'extend' kwarg is used, the levels are now chosen such that some data typically will fall in the extended range.

When contour is called with a <span class="title-ref">.LogNorm</span> or a <span class="title-ref">.LogLocator</span>, it will now select colors using the geometric mean rather than the arithmetic mean of the contour levels.

## Streamplot last row and column fixed

A bug was fixed where the last row and column of data in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.streamplot</span> were being dropped.

## Changed default <span class="title-ref">.AutoDateLocator</span> kwarg *interval\_multiples* to `True`

The default value of the tick locator for dates, <span class="title-ref">.dates.AutoDateLocator</span> kwarg *interval\_multiples* was set to `False` which leads to not-nice looking automatic ticks in many instances. The much nicer `interval_multiples=True` is the new default. See below to get the old behavior back:

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import datetime import matplotlib.dates as mdates

t0 = datetime.datetime(2009, 8, 20, 1, 10, 12) tf = datetime.datetime(2009, 8, 20, 1, 42, 11)

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, constrained\_layout=True) ax = axs\[0\] ax.axhspan(t0, tf, facecolor="blue", alpha=0.25) ax.set\_ylim(t0 - datetime.timedelta(minutes=3), tf + datetime.timedelta(minutes=3)) ax.set\_title('NEW DEFAULT')

ax = axs\[1\] ax.axhspan(t0, tf, facecolor="blue", alpha=0.25) ax.set\_ylim(t0 - datetime.timedelta(minutes=3), tf + datetime.timedelta(minutes=3)) \# old behavior locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator(interval\_multiples=False, ) ax.yaxis.set\_major\_locator(locator) ax.yaxis.set\_major\_formatter(mdates.AutoDateFormatter(locator))

ax.set\_title('OLD') plt.show()

</div>

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_position</span> now returns actual position if aspect changed

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_position</span> used to return the original position unless a draw had been triggered or <span class="title-ref">.Axes.apply\_aspect</span> had been called, even if the kwarg *original* was set to `False`. Now <span class="title-ref">.Axes.apply\_aspect</span> is called so `ax.get_position()` will return the new modified position. To get the old behavior use `ax.get_position(original=True)`.

## The ticks for colorbar now adjust for the size of the colorbar

Colorbar ticks now adjust for the size of the colorbar if the colorbar is made from a mappable that is not a contour or doesn't have a BoundaryNorm, or boundaries are not specified. If boundaries, etc are specified, the colorbar maintains the original behavior.

## Colorbar for log-scaled hexbin

When using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.hexbin</span> and plotting with a logarithmic color scale, the colorbar ticks are now correctly log scaled. Previously the tick values were linear scaled log(number of counts).

## PGF backend now explicitly makes black text black

Previous behavior with the pgf backend was for text specified as black to actually be the default color of whatever was rendering the pgf file (which was of course usually black). The new behavior is that black text is black, regardless of the default color. However, this means that there is no way to fall back on the default color of the renderer.

## Blacklisted rcparams no longer updated by <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rcdefaults</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_file\_defaults</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_file</span>

The rc modifier functions <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rcdefaults</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_file\_defaults</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_file</span> now ignore rcParams in the `matplotlib.style.core.STYLE_BLACKLIST` set. In particular, this prevents the `backend` and `interactive` rcParams from being incorrectly modified by these functions.

## <span class="title-ref">.CallbackRegistry</span> now stores callbacks using stdlib's <span class="title-ref">weakref.WeakMethod</span>s

In particular, this implies that `CallbackRegistry.callbacks[signal]` is now a mapping of callback ids to <span class="title-ref">weakref.WeakMethod</span>s (i.e., they need to be first called with no arguments to retrieve the method itself).

## Changes regarding the text.latex.unicode rcParam

The rcParam now defaults to True and is deprecated (i.e., in future versions of Matplotlib, unicode input will always be supported).

Moreover, the underlying implementation now uses `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` instead of `\usepackage{ucs}\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}`.

## Return type of ArtistInspector.get\_aliases changed

`ArtistInspector.get_aliases` previously returned the set of aliases as `{fullname: {alias1: None, alias2: None, ...}}`. The dict-to-None mapping was used to simulate a set in earlier versions of Python. It has now been replaced by a set, i.e. `{fullname: {alias1, alias2, ...}}`.

This value is also stored in `ArtistInspector.aliasd`, which has likewise changed.

## Removed `pytz` as a dependency

Since `dateutil` and `pytz` both provide time zones, and matplotlib already depends on `dateutil`, matplotlib will now use `dateutil` time zones internally and drop the redundant dependency on `pytz`. While `dateutil` time zones are preferred (and currently recommended in the Python documentation), the explicit use of `pytz` zones is still supported.

## Deprecations

### Modules

The following modules are deprecated:

  - `matplotlib.compat.subprocess`. This was a python 2 workaround, but all the functionality can now be found in the python 3 standard library `subprocess`.
  - `matplotlib.backends.wx_compat`. Python 3 is only compatible with wxPython 4, so support for wxPython 3 or earlier can be dropped.

### Classes, methods, functions, and attributes

The following classes, methods, functions, and attributes are deprecated:

  - `RcParams.msg_depr`, `RcParams.msg_depr_ignore`, `RcParams.msg_depr_set`, `RcParams.msg_obsolete`, `RcParams.msg_backend_obsolete`

  - `afm.parse_afm`

  - `backend_pdf.PdfFile.texFontMap`

  - `backend_pgf.get_texcommand`

  - `backend_ps.get_bbox`

  - `backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT.keyAutoRepeat` (directly check `event.guiEvent.isAutoRepeat()` in the event handler to decide whether to handle autorepeated key presses).

  - `backend_qt5.error_msg_qt`, `backend_qt5.exception_handler`

  - `backend_wx.FigureCanvasWx.macros`

  - `backends.pylab_setup`

  - `cbook.GetRealpathAndStat`, `cbook.Locked`

  - `cbook.is_numlike` (use `isinstance(..., numbers.Number)` instead), `cbook.listFiles`, `cbook.unicode_safe`

  - `container.Container.set_remove_method`,

  - `contour.ContourLabeler.cl`, `.cl_xy`, and `.cl_cvalues`

  - `dates.DateFormatter.strftime_pre_1900`, `dates.DateFormatter.strftime`

  - `font_manager.TempCache`

  - `image._ImageBase.iterpnames`, use the `interpolation_names` property instead. (this affects classes that inherit from `_ImageBase` including <span class="title-ref">.FigureImage</span>, <span class="title-ref">.BboxImage</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.AxesImage</span>)

  - `mathtext.unichr_safe` (use `chr` instead)

  - `patches.Polygon.xy`

  - `table.Table.get_child_artists` (use `get_children` instead)

  - `testing.compare.ImageComparisonTest`, `testing.compare.compare_float`

  - `testing.decorators.CleanupTest`, `testing.decorators.skip_if_command_unavailable`

  - `FigureCanvasQT.keyAutoRepeat` (directly check `event.guiEvent.isAutoRepeat()` in the event handler to decide whether to handle autorepeated key presses)

  - `FigureCanvasWx.macros`

  - `_ImageBase.iterpnames`, use the `interpolation_names` property instead. (this affects classes that inherit from `_ImageBase` including <span class="title-ref">.FigureImage</span>, <span class="title-ref">.BboxImage</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.AxesImage</span>)

  - `patches.Polygon.xy`

  - `texmanager.dvipng_hack_alpha`

  - `text.Annotation.arrow`

  -   - `Legend.draggable()`, in favor of <span class="title-ref">.Legend.set\_draggable()</span>  
        (`Legend.draggable` may be reintroduced as a property in future releases)

  - `textpath.TextToPath.tex_font_map`

  - `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation.mplDeprecation` will be removed in future versions. It is just an alias for `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning`. Please use `matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` directly if necessary.

  - The `matplotlib.cbook.Bunch` class has been deprecated. Instead, use <span class="title-ref">types.SimpleNamespace</span> from the standard library which provides the same functionality.

  - `Axes.mouseover_set` is now a frozenset, and deprecated. Directly manipulate the artist's `.mouseover` attribute to change their mouseover status.

The following keyword arguments are deprecated:

  - passing `verts` to `Axes.scatter` (use `marker` instead)
  - passing `obj_type` to `cbook.deprecated`

The following call signatures are deprecated:

  - passing a `wx.EvtHandler` as first argument to `backend_wx.TimerWx`

### rcParams

The following rcParams are deprecated:

  - `examples.directory` (use `datapath` instead)
  - `pgf.debug` (the pgf backend relies on logging)
  - `text.latex.unicode` (always True now)

### marker styles

  - Using `(n, 3)` as marker style to specify a circle marker is deprecated. Use `"o"` instead.
  - Using `([(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...], 0)` as marker style to specify a custom marker path is deprecated. Use `[(x0, y0), (x1, y1), ...]` instead.

### Deprecation of `LocatableAxes` in toolkits

The `LocatableAxes` classes in toolkits have been deprecated. The base <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> classes provide the same functionality to all subclasses, thus these mixins are no longer necessary. Related functions have also been deprecated. Specifically:

  - `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_divider.LocatableAxesBase`: no specific replacement; use any other `Axes`-derived class directly instead.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_divider.locatable_axes_factory`: no specific replacement; use any other `Axes`-derived class directly instead.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_divider.Axes`: use <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.mpl\_axes.Axes</span> directly.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_divider.LocatableAxes`: use <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.mpl\_axes.Axes</span> directly.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_divider.Axes`: use <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist.axislines.Axes</span> directly.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_divider.LocatableAxes`: use <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist.axislines.Axes</span> directly.

## Removals

### Hold machinery

Setting or unsetting `hold` (\[deprecated in version 2.0\<v200\_deprecate\_hold\>\](\#deprecated-in-version-2.0\<v200\_deprecate\_hold\>)) has now been completely removed. Matplotlib now always behaves as if `hold=True`. To clear an axes you can manually use <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.cla()</span>, or to clear an entire figure use <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure.clear()</span>.

### Removal of deprecated backends

Deprecated backends have been removed:

  - GTKAgg
  - GTKCairo
  - GTK
  - GDK

### Deprecated APIs

  - `backend_wxagg.Toolbar` (alternative: `backend_wxagg.NavigationToolbar2WxAgg`)
  - `RendererAgg.debug()`
  - passing non-numbers to `EngFormatter.format_eng`
  - passing `frac` to `PolarAxes.set_theta_grids`
  - any mention of idle events

The following API elements have been removed:

  - `backend_cairo.HAS_CAIRO_CFFI`
  - `sphinxext.sphinx_version`

### Proprietary sphinx directives

The matplotlib documentation used the proprietary sphinx directives `.. htmlonly::`, and `.. latexonly::`. These have been replaced with the standard sphinx directives `.. only:: html` and `.. only:: latex`. This change will not affect any users. Only downstream package maintainers, who have used the proprietary directives in their docs, will have to switch to the sphinx directives.

### lib/mpl\_examples symlink

The symlink from lib/mpl\_examples to ../examples has been removed. This is not installed as an importable package and should not affect end users, however this may require down-stream packagers to adjust. The content is still available top-level examples directory.

# API Changes for 3.0.1

`matplotlib.tight_layout.auto_adjust_subplotpars` can return `None` now if the new subplotparams will collapse axes to zero width or height. This prevents `tight_layout` from being executed. Similarly `matplotlib.tight_layout.get_tight_layout_figure` will return None.

To improve import (startup) time, private modules are now imported lazily. These modules are no longer available at these locations:

  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_agg._png`
  - `matplotlib.contour._contour`
  - `matplotlib.image._png`
  - `matplotlib.mathtext._png`
  - `matplotlib.testing.compare._png`
  - `matplotlib.texmanager._png`
  - `matplotlib.tri.triangulation._tri`
  - `matplotlib.tri.triangulation._qhull`
  - `matplotlib.tri.tricontour._tri`
  - `matplotlib.tri.trifinder._tri`

# API Changes for 3.1.0

<div class="contents" data-local="" data-depth="1">

</div>

## Behavior changes

### Matplotlib.use

Switching backends via <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span> is now allowed by default, regardless of whether <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot</span> has been imported. If the user tries to switch from an already-started interactive backend to a different interactive backend, an <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span> will be raised.

### Invalid points in PathCollections

PathCollections created with <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span> now keep track of invalid points. Previously, points with nonfinite (infinite or nan) coordinates would not be included in the offsets (as returned by <span class="title-ref">.PathCollection.get\_offsets</span>) of a <span class="title-ref">.PathCollection</span> created by <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>, and points with nonfinite values (as specified by the *c* kwarg) would not be included in the array (as returned by <span class="title-ref">.PathCollection.get\_array</span>)

Such points are now included, but masked out by returning a masked array.

If the *plotnonfinite* kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span> is set, then points with nonfinite values are plotted using the bad color of the <span class="title-ref">.collections.PathCollection</span>'s colormap (as set by <span class="title-ref">.colors.Colormap.set\_bad</span>).

### Alpha blending in imshow of RBGA input

The alpha-channel of RBGA images is now re-sampled independently of RGB channels. While this is a bug fix, it does change the output and may result in some down-stream image comparison tests to fail.

### Autoscaling

On log-axes where a single value is plotted at a "full" decade (1, 10, 100, etc.), the autoscaling now expands the axis symmetrically around that point, instead of adding a decade only to the right.

### Log-scaled axes

When the default <span class="title-ref">.LogLocator</span> would generate no ticks for an axis (e.g., an axis with limits from 0.31 to 0.39) or only a single tick, it now instead falls back on the linear <span class="title-ref">.AutoLocator</span> to pick reasonable tick positions.

### <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_subplot</span> with no arguments

Calling <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_subplot()</span> with no positional arguments used to do nothing; this now is equivalent to calling `add_subplot(111)` instead.

### <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> and rcparams

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> now respects `boxplot.boxprops.linewidth` even when *patch\_artist* is set. Previously, when the *patch\_artist* parameter was set, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> would ignore `boxplot.boxprops.linewidth`. This was an oversight -- in particular, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span> did not ignore it.

### Major/minor tick collisions

Minor ticks that collide with major ticks are now hidden by default. Previously, certain locator classes (<span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.LogLocator</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.AutoMinorLocator</span>) contained custom logic to avoid emitting tick locations that collided with major ticks when they were used as minor locators. This logic has now moved to the <span class="title-ref">\~.axis.Axis</span> class, and is used regardless of the locator class. You can control this behavior via the <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.remove\_overlapping\_locs</span> attribute on <span class="title-ref">\~.axis.Axis</span>.

If you were relying on both the major and minor tick labels to appear on the same tick, you may need to update your code. For example, the following snippet :

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.dates as mdates
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    t = np.arange("2018-11-03", "2018-11-06", dtype="datetime64")
    x = np.random.rand(len(t))
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.plot(t, x)
    ax.xaxis.set(
        major_locator=mdates.DayLocator(),
        major_formatter=mdates.DateFormatter("\n%a"),
        minor_locator=mdates.HourLocator((0, 6, 12, 18)),
        minor_formatter=mdates.DateFormatter("%H:%M"),
    )
    # disable removing overlapping locations
    ax.xaxis.remove_overlapping_locs = False
    plt.show()

labeled days using major ticks, and hours and minutes using minor ticks and added a newline to the major ticks labels to avoid them crashing into the minor tick labels. Setting the <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.remove\_overlapping\_locs</span> property (also accessible via <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.set\_remove\_overlapping\_locs</span> / <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.get\_remove\_overlapping\_locs</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.setp</span>) disables removing overlapping tick locations.

The major tick labels could also be adjusted include hours and minutes, as the minor ticks are gone, so the `major_formatter` would be:

    mdates.DateFormatter("%H:%M\n%a")

### usetex support

Previously, if `text.usetex` was True, then constructing a <span class="title-ref">.TextPath</span> on a non-mathtext string with `usetex=False` would rely on the mathtext parser (but not on usetex support\!) to parse the string. The mathtext parser is not invoked anymore, which may cause slight changes in glyph positioning.

### get\_window\_extents

<span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_window\_extent</span> used to return a bounding box that was slightly larger than the axes, presumably to take into account the ticks that may be on a spine. However, it was not scaling the tick sizes according to the dpi of the canvas, and it did not check if the ticks were visible, or on the spine.

Now <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_window\_extent</span> just returns the axes extent with no padding for ticks.

This affects <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span> in cases where there are outward ticks with no tick labels, and it also removes the (small) pad around axes in that case.

<span class="title-ref">.spines.Spine.get\_window\_extent</span> now takes into account ticks that are on the spine.

### Sankey

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.Sankey.add</span> would only accept a single string as the *labels* argument if its length is equal to the number of flows, in which case it would use one character of the string for each flow.

The behavior has been changed to match the documented one: when a single string is passed, it is used to label all the flows.

### <span class="title-ref">\~.font\_manager.FontManager</span> scores

<span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.FontManager.score\_weight</span> is now more strict with its inputs. Previously, when a weight string was passed to <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.FontManager.score\_weight</span>,

  - if the weight was the string representation of an integer, it would be converted to that integer,
  - otherwise, if the weight was not a standard weight name, it would be silently replaced by a value of 500 ("normal" weight).

<span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.FontManager.score\_weight</span> now raises an exception on such inputs.

### Text alignment

Text alignment was previously incorrect, in particular for multiline text objects with large descenders (i.e. subscripts) and rotated text. These have been fixed and made more consistent, but could make old code that has compensated for this no longer have the correct alignment.

### Upper case color strings

Support for passing single-letter colors (one of "rgbcmykw") as UPPERCASE characters is deprecated; these colors will become case-sensitive (lowercase) after the deprecation period has passed.

The goal is to decrease the number of ambiguous cases when using the `data` keyword to plotting methods; e.g. `plot("X", "Y", data={"X": ..., "Y": ...})` will not warn about "Y" possibly being a color anymore after the deprecation period has passed.

### Degenerate limits

When bounds passed to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.set\_xlim</span> are degenerate (i.e. the lower and upper value are equal), the method used to "expand" the bounds now matches the expansion behavior of autoscaling when the plot contains a single x-value, and should in particular produce nicer limits for non-linear scales.

### <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> format string parsing

In certain cases, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> would previously accept format strings specifying more than one linestyle (e.g. `"---."` which specifies both `"--"` and `"-."`); only use one of them would be used. This now raises a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> instead.

### HTMLWriter

The HTMLWriter constructor is more strict: it no longer normalizes unknown values of *default\_mode* to 'loop', but errors out instead.

### AFM parsing

In accordance with the AFM spec, the AFM parser no longer truncates the `UnderlinePosition` and `UnderlineThickness` fields to integers.

The `Notice` field (which can only be publicly accessed by the deprecated `afm.parse_afm` API) is no longer decoded to a <span class="title-ref">str</span>, but instead kept as <span class="title-ref">bytes</span>, to support non-conformant AFM files that use non-ASCII characters in that field.

### <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set</span> keyword normalisation

<span class="title-ref">.Artist.set</span> now normalizes keywords before sorting them. Previously it sorted its keyword arguments in reverse alphabetical order (with a special-case to put `color` at the end) before applying them.

It now normalizes aliases (and, as above, emits a warning on duplicate properties) before doing the sorting (so `c` goes to the end too).

### <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span> argument checking

Previously <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span> silently did nothing when an invalid *axis* parameter was supplied. This behavior has been changed to raise a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> instead.

### <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist</span> output

Input that consists of multiple empty lists will now return a list of histogram values for each one of the lists. For example, an input of `[[],[]]` will return 2 lists of histogram values. Previously, a single list was returned.

### `backend_bases.TimerBase.remove_callback` future signature change

Currently, `backend_bases.TimerBase.remove_callback(func, *args, **kwargs)` removes a callback previously added by `backend_bases.Timer.add_callback(func, *args, **kwargs)`, but if `*args, **kwargs` is not passed in (i.e., `TimerBase.remove_callback(func)`), then the first callback with a matching `func` is removed, regardless of whether it was added with or without `*args, **kwargs`.

In a future version, <span class="title-ref">.TimerBase.remove\_callback</span> will always use the latter behavior (not consider `*args, **kwargs`); to specifically consider them, add the callback as a <span class="title-ref">functools.partial</span> object :

    cb = timer.add_callback(functools.partial(func, *args, **kwargs))
    # ...
    # later
    timer.remove_callback(cb)

<span class="title-ref">.TimerBase.add\_callback</span> was modified to return *func* to simplify the above usage (previously it returned None); this also allows using it as a decorator.

The new API is modelled after <span class="title-ref">atexit.register</span> / <span class="title-ref">atexit.unregister</span>.

### <span class="title-ref">\~.container.StemContainer</span> performance increase

<span class="title-ref">\~.container.StemContainer</span> objects can now store a <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.LineCollection</span> object instead of a list of <span class="title-ref">\~.lines.Line2D</span> objects for stem lines plotted using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span>. This gives a very large performance boost to displaying and moving <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> plots.

This will become the default behaviour in Matplotlib 3.3. To use it now, the *use\_line\_collection* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> can be set to <span class="title-ref">True</span> :

    ax.stem(..., use_line_collection=True)

Individual line segments can be extracted from the <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.LineCollection</span> using <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.LineCollection.get\_segments()</span>. See the <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.LineCollection</span> documentation for other methods to retrieve the collection properties.

### <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase</span> inheritance

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase</span> is no longer a subclass of <span class="title-ref">.cm.ScalarMappable</span>. This inheritance lead to a confusing situation where the <span class="title-ref">.cm.ScalarMappable</span> passed to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> (<span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.colorbar</span>) had a `set_norm` method, as did the colorbar. The colorbar is now purely a follower to the <span class="title-ref">.ScalarMappable</span> norm and colormap, and the old inherited methods `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_norm`, `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_cmap`, `matplotlib.colorbar.ColorbarBase.set_clim` are deprecated, as are the getter versions of those calls. To set the norm associated with a colorbar do `colorbar.mappable.set_norm()` etc.

### FreeType and libpng search paths

The `MPLBASEDIRLIST` environment variables and `basedirlist` entry in `setup.cfg` have no effect anymore. Instead, if building in situations where FreeType or libpng are not in the compiler or linker's default path, set the standard environment variables `CFLAGS`/`LDFLAGS` on Linux or OSX, or `CL`/`LINK` on Windows, to indicate the relevant paths.

See details in \[/install/index\](/install/index.md).

### Setting artist properties twice or more in the same call

Setting the same artist property multiple time via aliases is deprecated. Previously, code such as :

    plt.plot([0, 1], c="red", color="blue")

would emit a warning indicating that `c` and `color` are aliases of one another, and only keep the `color` kwarg. This behavior has been deprecated; in a future version, this will raise a TypeError, similar to Python's behavior when a keyword argument is passed twice :

    plt.plot([0, 1], c="red", c="blue")

This warning is raised by <span class="title-ref">\~.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span>.

### Path code types

Path code types like `Path.MOVETO` are now `np.uint8` instead of `int` `Path.STOP`, `Path.MOVETO`, `Path.LINETO`, `Path.CURVE3`, `Path.CURVE4` and `Path.CLOSEPOLY` are now of the type `Path.code_type` (`np.uint8` by default) instead of plain `int`. This makes their type match the array value type of the `Path.codes` array.

### LaTeX code in matplotlibrc file

Previously, the rc file keys `pgf.preamble` and `text.latex.preamble` were parsed using commas as separators. This would break valid LaTeX code, such as:

    \usepackage[protrusion=true, expansion=false]{microtype}

The parsing has been modified to pass the complete line to the LaTeX system, keeping all commas. Passing a list of strings from within a Python script still works as it used to. Passing a list containing non-strings now fails, instead of coercing the results to strings.

### <span class="title-ref">.Axes.spy</span>

The method <span class="title-ref">.Axes.spy</span> now raises a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> for the keyword arguments *interpolation* and *linestyle* instead of silently ignoring them.

Furthermore, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.spy</span> spy does now allow for an *extent* argument (was silently ignored so far).

A bug with `Axes.spy(..., origin='lower')` is fixed. Previously this flipped the data but not the y-axis resulting in a mismatch between axes labels and actual data indices. Now, *origin='lower'* flips both the data and the y-axis labels.

### Boxplot tick methods

The *manage\_xticks* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> has been renamed (with a deprecation period) to *manage\_ticks*, to take into account the fact that it manages either x or y ticks depending on the *vert* parameter.

When `manage_ticks=True` (the default), these methods now attempt to take previously drawn boxplots into account when setting the axis limits, ticks, and tick labels.

### MouseEvents

MouseEvents now include the event name in their `str()`. Previously they contained the prefix "MPL MouseEvent".

### RGBA buffer return type

<span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasAgg.buffer\_rgba</span> and <span class="title-ref">.RendererAgg.buffer\_rgba</span> now return a memoryview The `buffer_rgba` method now allows direct access to the renderer's underlying buffer (as a `(m, n, 4)`-shape memoryview) rather than copying the data to a new bytestring. This is consistent with the behavior on Py2, where a buffer object was returned.

### `matplotlib.font_manager.win32InstalledFonts` return type

`matplotlib.font_manager.win32InstalledFonts` returns an empty list instead of None if no fonts are found.

### `Axes.fmt_xdata` and `Axes.fmt_ydata` error handling

Previously, if the user provided a `Axes.fmt_xdata` or `Axes.fmt_ydata` function that raised a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> (or set them to a non-callable), the exception would be silently ignored and the default formatter be used instead. This is no longer the case; the exception is now propagated out.

### Deprecation of redundant <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span> attributes

The `gridOn`, `tick1On`, `tick2On`, `label1On`, and `label2On` <span class="title-ref">\~.Tick</span> attributes have been deprecated. Directly get and set the visibility on the underlying artists, available as the `gridline`, `tick1line`, `tick2line`, `label1`, and `label2` attributes.

The `label` attribute, which was an alias for `label1`, has been deprecated.

Subclasses that relied on setting the above visibility attributes needs to be updated; see e.g. `examples/api/skewt.py`.

### Passing a Line2D's drawstyle together with the linestyle is deprecated

Instead of `plt.plot(..., linestyle="steps--")`, use `plt.plot(..., linestyle="--", drawstyle="steps")`. `ds` is now an alias for `drawstyle`.

## `pgi` support dropped

Support for `pgi` in the GTK3 backends has been dropped. `pgi` is an alternative implementation to `PyGObject`. `PyGObject` should be used instead.

## rcParam changes

### Removed

The following deprecated rcParams have been removed:

  - `text.dvipnghack`
  - `nbagg.transparent` (use `figure.facecolor` instead)
  - `plugins.directory`
  - `axes.hold`
  - `backend.qt4` and `backend.qt5` (set the `QT_API` environment variable instead)

### Deprecated

The associated validator functions `rcsetup.validate_qt4` and `validate_qt5` are deprecated.

The `verbose.fileo` and `verbose.level` rcParams have been deprecated. These have had no effect since the switch from Matplotlib's old custom Verbose logging to the stdlib's <span class="title-ref">logging</span> module. In addition the `rcsetup.validate_verbose` function is deprecated.

The `text.latex.unicode` rcParam now defaults to `True` and is deprecated (i.e., in future versions of Matplotlib, unicode input will always be supported). Moreover, the underlying implementation now uses `\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}` instead of `\usepackage{ucs}\usepackage[utf8x]{inputenc}`.

## Exception changes

  - `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_size.GetExtentHelper` now raises <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> for invalid directions instead of <span class="title-ref">KeyError</span>.
  - Previously, subprocess failures in the animation framework would raise either in a <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> or a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> depending on when the error occurred. They now raise a <span class="title-ref">subprocess.CalledProcessError</span> with attributes set as documented by the exception class.
  - In certain cases, Axes methods (and pyplot functions) used to raise a <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> if they were called with a `data` kwarg and otherwise mismatched arguments. They now raise a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> instead.
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.streamplot</span> does not support irregularly gridded `x` and `y` values. So far, it used to silently plot an incorrect result. This has been changed to raise a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> instead.
  - The `streamplot.Grid` class, which is internally used by streamplot code, also throws a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> when irregularly gridded values are passed in.

## Removals

The following deprecated APIs have been removed:

### Classes and methods

  - `Verbose` (replaced by python logging library)
  - `artist.Artist.hitlist` (no replacement)
  - `artist.Artist.is_figure_set` (use `artist.figure is not None` instead)
  - `axis.Axis.unit_data` (use `axis.Axis.units` instead)
  - `backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.onRemove` (no replacement) `backend_bases.FigureManagerBase.show_popup` (this never did anything)
  - `backend_wx.SubplotToolWx` (no replacement)
  - `backend_wx.Toolbar` (use `backend_wx.NavigationToolbar2Wx` instead)
  - `cbook.align_iterators` (no replacement)
  - `contour.ContourLabeler.get_real_label_width` (no replacement)
  - `legend.Legend.draggable` (use <span class="title-ref">.legend.Legend.set\_draggable()</span> instead)
  - `texmanager.TexManager.postscriptd`, `texmanager.TexManager.pscnt`, `texmanager.TexManager.make_ps`, `texmanager.TexManager.get_ps_bbox` (no replacements)

### Arguments

  - The *fig* kwarg to <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec.get\_subplot\_params</span> and <span class="title-ref">.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec.get\_subplot\_params</span> (use the argument *figure* instead)
  - Passing 'box-forced' to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_adjustable</span> (use 'box' instead)
  - Support for the strings 'on'/'true'/'off'/'false' to mean <span class="title-ref">True</span> / <span class="title-ref">False</span> (directly use <span class="title-ref">True</span> / <span class="title-ref">False</span> instead). The following functions are affected:
      - <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.grid</span>
      - <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.grid</span>
      - <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span>
      - <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.box</span>
  - Using <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.axes</span> with an <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes</span> type argument (use <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.sca</span> instead)

### Other

The following miscellaneous API elements have been removed

  - svgfont support (in `svg.fonttype`)

  - Logging is now done with the standard python `logging` library. `matplotlib.verbose` and the command line switches `--verbose-LEVEL` have been removed.
    
    To control the logging output use:
    
        import logging
        logger = logging.getLogger('matplotlib')
        logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
        # configure log handling: Either include it into your ``logging`` hierarchy,
        # e.g. by configuring a root looger using ``logging.basicConfig()``,
        # or add a standalone handler to the matplotlib logger:
        logger.addHandler(logging.StreamHandler())

  - `__version__numpy__`

  - `collections.CIRCLE_AREA_FACTOR`

  - `font_manager.USE_FONTCONFIG`

  - `font_manager.cachedir`

## `matplotlib.mlab` removals

## <span class="title-ref">pylab</span> removals

Lots of code inside the `matplotlib.mlab` module which was deprecated in Matplotlib 2.2 has been removed. This means the following functions are no longer available in the <span class="title-ref">pylab</span> module:

  - `amap`
  - `base_repr`
  - `binary_repr`
  - `bivariate_normal`
  - `center_matrix`
  - `csv2rec` (use <span class="title-ref">numpy.recarray.tofile</span> instead)
  - `dist` (use <span class="title-ref">numpy.hypot</span> instead)
  - `dist_point_to_segment`
  - `distances_along_curve`
  - `entropy` (use <span class="title-ref">scipy.stats.entropy</span> instead)
  - `exp_safe` (use <span class="title-ref">numpy.exp</span> instead)

  - `get_sparse_matrix`
  - `get_xyz_where`
  - `griddata` (use <span class="title-ref">scipy.interpolate.griddata</span> instead)

  - `log2` (use <span class="title-ref">numpy.log2</span> instead)
  - `longest_contiguous_ones`
  - `longest_ones`
  - `movavg`

  - `path_length`
  - `poly_below`
  - `poly_between`
  - `prctile` (use <span class="title-ref">numpy.percentile</span> instead)

  - `stineman_interp`
  - `vector_lengths`

## mplot3d changes

### Voxel shading

<span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.voxels</span> now shades the resulting voxels; for more details see What's new. The previous behavior can be achieved by passing :

    ax.voxels(.., shade=False)

### Equal aspect axes disabled

Setting the aspect on 3D axes previously returned non-sensical results (e.g. see `1077`). Calling `ax.set_aspect('equal')` or `ax.set_aspect(num)` on a 3D axes now raises a <span class="title-ref">NotImplementedError</span>.

### <span class="title-ref">.Poly3DCollection.set\_zsort</span>

<span class="title-ref">.Poly3DCollection.set\_zsort</span> no longer silently ignores invalid inputs, or <span class="title-ref">False</span> (which was always broken). Passing <span class="title-ref">True</span> to mean `"average"` is deprecated.

## Testing

The `--no-network` flag to `tests.py` has been removed (no test requires internet access anymore). If it is desired to disable internet access both for old and new versions of Matplotlib, use `tests.py -m 'not network'` (which is now a no-op).

The image comparison test decorators now skip (rather than xfail) the test for uncomparable formats. The affected decorators are <span class="title-ref">\~.image\_comparison</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.check\_figures\_equal</span>. The deprecated `ImageComparisonTest` class is likewise changed.

## Dependency changes

### NumPy

Matplotlib 3.1 now requires NumPy\>=1.11.

### ghostscript

Support for ghostscript 8.60 (released in 2007) has been removed. The oldest supported version of ghostscript is now 9.0 (released in 2010).

## Mathtext changes

  - In constructs such as `"$1~2$"`, mathtext now interprets the tilde as a space, consistently with TeX (this was previously a parse error).

### Deprecations

  - The `\stackrel` mathtext command has been deprecated (it behaved differently from LaTeX's `\stackrel`. To stack two mathtext expressions, use `\genfrac{left-delim}{right-delim}{fraction-bar-thickness}{}{top}{bottom}`.
  - The `\mathcircled` mathtext command (which is not a real TeX command) is deprecated. Directly use unicode characters (e.g. `"\N{CIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A}"` or `"\u24b6"`) instead.
  - Support for setting `mathtext.default` to circled is deprecated.

## Signature deprecations

The following signature related behaviours are deprecated:

  - The *withdash* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.text()</span>. Consider using <span class="title-ref">.Axes.annotate()</span> instead.
  - Passing (n, 1)-shaped error arrays to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar()</span>, which was not documented and did not work for `n = 2`. Pass a 1D array instead.
  - The *frameon* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span> and the `savefig.frameon` rcParam. To emulate `frameon = False`, set *facecolor* to fully transparent (`"none"`, or `(0, 0, 0, 0)`).
  - Passing a non-1D (typically, (n, 1)-shaped) input to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span>. Pass a 1D array instead.
  - The <span class="title-ref">.TextPath</span> constructor used to silently drop ignored arguments; this behavior is deprecated.
  - The *usetex* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.TextToPath.get\_text\_path</span> is deprecated and folded into the *ismath* parameter, which can now take the values <span class="title-ref">False</span>, <span class="title-ref">True</span>, and `"TeX"`, consistently with other low-level text processing functions.
  - Passing `'normal'` to <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.axis()</span> is deprecated, use `ax.axis('auto')` instead.
  - Passing the *block* argument of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.show</span> positionally is deprecated; it should be passed by keyword.
  - When using the nbagg backend, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.show</span> used to silently accept and ignore all combinations of positional and keyword arguments. This behavior is deprecated.
  - The unused *shape* and *imlim* parameters to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.imshow</span> are deprecated. To avoid triggering the deprecation warning, the *filternorm*, *filterrad*, *resample*, and *url* arguments should be passed by keyword.
  - The *interp\_at\_native* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.BboxImage</span>, which has had no effect since Matplotlib 2.0, is deprecated.
  - All arguments to the `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation.deprecated` decorator and `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation.warn_deprecated` function, except the first one (the version where the deprecation occurred), are now keyword-only. The goal is to avoid accidentally setting the "message" argument when the "name" (or "alternative") argument was intended, as this has repeatedly occurred in the past.
  - The arguments of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.testing.compare.calculate\_rms</span> have been renamed from `expectedImage, actualImage`, to `expected_image, actual_image`.
  - Passing positional arguments to <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticklabels</span> beyond *ticklabels* itself has no effect, and support for them is deprecated.
  - Passing `shade=None` to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span> is deprecated. This was an unintended implementation detail with the same semantics as `shade=False`. Please use the latter code instead.
  - <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator</span> and its *set\_params* method will issue a warning on unknown keyword arguments instead of silently ignoring them. Future versions will raise an error.

## Changes in parameter names

  - The *arg* parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span> has been renamed to *backend*.
    
    This will only affect cases where that parameter has been set as a keyword argument. The common usage pattern as a positional argument `matplotlib.use('Qt5Agg')` is not affected.

  - The *normed* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist2d</span> has been renamed to *density*.

  - The *s* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> (and indirectly <span class="title-ref">.Axes.annotate</span>) has been renamed to *text*.

  - The *tolerence* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.bezier.find\_bezier\_t\_intersecting\_with\_closedpath</span>, <span class="title-ref">.bezier.split\_bezier\_intersecting\_with\_closedpath</span>, `bezier.find_r_to_boundary_of_closedpath`, <span class="title-ref">.bezier.split\_path\_inout</span> and <span class="title-ref">.bezier.check\_if\_parallel</span> has been renamed to *tolerance*.

In each case, the old parameter name remains supported (it cannot be used simultaneously with the new name), but support for it will be dropped in Matplotlib 3.3.

## Class/method/attribute deprecations

Support for custom backends that do not provide a <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase.set\_hatch\_color</span> method is deprecated. We suggest that custom backends let their `GraphicsContext` class inherit from <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase</span>, to at least provide stubs for all required methods.

  - `spine.Spine.is_frame_like`

This has not been used in the codebase since its addition in 2009.

  - `axis3d.Axis.get_tick_positions`
    
    This has never been used internally, there is no equivalent method exists on the 2D Axis classes, and despite the similar name, it has a completely different behavior from the 2D Axis' `axis.Axis.get_ticks_position` method.

  - `.backend_pgf.LatexManagerFactory`

  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axislines.SimpleChainedObjects`

  - `mpl_toolkits.Axes.AxisDict`

### Internal Helper Functions

  - `checkdep_dvipng`
  - `checkdep_ghostscript`
  - `checkdep_pdftops`
  - `checkdep_inkscape`
  - `ticker.decade_up`
  - `ticker.decade_down`
  - `cbook.dedent`
  - `docstring.Appender`
  - `docstring.dedent`
  - `docstring.copy_dedent`

Use the standard library's docstring manipulation tools instead, such as <span class="title-ref">inspect.cleandoc</span> and <span class="title-ref">inspect.getdoc</span>.

  - `matplotlib.scale.get_scale_docs()`
  - `matplotlib.pyplot.get_scale_docs()`

These are considered internal and will be removed from the public API in a future version.

  - `projections.process_projection_requirements`
  - `backend_ps.PsBackendHelper`
  - `backend_ps.ps_backend_helper`,
  - `cbook.iterable`
  - `cbook.get_label`
  - `cbook.safezip` Manually check the lengths of the inputs instead, or rely on NumPy to do it.
  - `cbook.is_hashable` Use `isinstance(..., collections.abc.Hashable)` instead.
  - The `.backend_bases.RendererBase.strip_math`. Use <span class="title-ref">.cbook.strip\_math</span> instead.

Multiple internal functions that were exposed as part of the public API of <span class="title-ref">.mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d</span> are deprecated,

**mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d**

  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.norm_angle`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.norm_text_angle`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.path_to_3d_segment`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.paths_to_3d_segments`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.path_to_3d_segment_with_codes`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.paths_to_3d_segments_with_codes`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.get_patch_verts`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.get_colors`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.zalpha`

**mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d**

  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.line2d`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.line2d_dist`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.line2d_seg_dist`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.mod`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.proj_transform_vec`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.proj_transform_vec_clip`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.vec_pad_ones`
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d.proj_trans_clip_points`

If your project relies on these functions, consider vendoring them.

### Font Handling

  - `backend_pdf.RendererPdf.afm_font_cache`
  - `backend_ps.RendererPS.afmfontd`
  - `font_manager.OSXInstalledFonts`
  - `.TextToPath.glyph_to_path` (Instead call `font.get_path()` and manually transform the path.)

### Date related functions

  - `dates.seconds()`
  - `dates.minutes()`
  - `dates.hours()`
  - `dates.weeks()`
  - `dates.strpdate2num`
  - `dates.bytespdate2num`

These are brittle in the presence of locale changes. Use standard datetime parsers such as <span class="title-ref">time.strptime</span> or <span class="title-ref">dateutil.parser.parse</span>, and additionally call <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.date2num</span> if you need to convert to Matplotlib's internal datetime representation; or use `dates.datestr2num`.

### Axes3D

  - `.axes3d.Axes3D.w_xaxis`
  - `.axes3d.Axes3D.w_yaxis`
  - `.axes3d.Axes3D.w_zaxis`

Use `axes3d.Axes3D.xaxis`, `axes3d.Axes3D.yaxis` and `axes3d.Axes3D.zaxis` instead.

### Testing

  - `matplotlib.testing.decorators.switch_backend` decorator

Test functions should use `pytest.mark.backend`, and the mark will be picked up by the `matplotlib.testing.conftest.mpl_test_settings` fixture.

### Quiver

  - `.color` attribute of <span class="title-ref">.Quiver</span> objects

Instead, use (as for any <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>) the `get_facecolor` method. Note that setting to the `.color` attribute did not update the quiver artist, whereas calling `set_facecolor` does.

### GUI / backend details

  - `.get_py2exe_datafiles`
  - `.tk_window_focus`
  - `.backend_gtk3.FileChooserDialog`
  - `.backend_gtk3.NavigationToolbar2GTK3.get_filechooser`
  - `.backend_gtk3.SaveFigureGTK3.get_filechooser`
  - `.NavigationToolbar2QT.adj_window` attribute. This is unused and always `None`.
  - `.backend_wx.IDLE_DELAY` global variable This is unused and only relevant to the now removed wx "idling" code (note that as it is a module-level global, no deprecation warning is emitted when accessing it).
  - `mlab.demean`
  - `backend_gtk3cairo.FigureCanvasGTK3Cairo`,
  - `backend_wx.debug_on_error`, `backend_wx.fake_stderr`, `backend_wx.raise_msg_to_str`, `backend_wx.MenuButtonWx`, `backend_wx.PrintoutWx`,
  - `matplotlib.backends.qt_editor.formlayout` module

This module is a vendored, modified version of the official [formlayout](https://pypi.org/project/formlayout/) module available on PyPI. Install that module separately if you need it.

  - `GraphicsContextPS.shouldstroke`

### Transforms / scales

  - `LogTransformBase`
  - `Log10Transform`
  - `Log2Transform`,
  - `NaturalLogTransformLog`
  - `InvertedLogTransformBase`
  - `InvertedLog10Transform`
  - `InvertedLog2Transform`
  - `InvertedNaturalLogTransform`

These classes defined in `matplotlib.scale` are deprecated. As a replacement, use the general <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.LogTransform</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.InvertedLogTransform</span> classes, whose constructors take a *base* argument.

### Locators / Formatters

  - `OldScalarFormatter.pprint_val`
  - `ScalarFormatter.pprint_val`
  - `LogFormatter.pprint_val`

These are helper methods that do not have a consistent signature across formatter classes.

### Path tools

  - `path.get_paths_extents`

Use <span class="title-ref">\~.path.get\_path\_collection\_extents</span> instead.

  - `.Path.has_nonfinite` attribute

Use `not np.isfinite(path.vertices).all()` instead.

  - `.bezier.find_r_to_boundary_of_closedpath` function is deprecated

This has always returned None instead of the requested radius.

### Text

  - `text.TextWithDash`
  - `Text.is_math_text`
  - `TextPath.is_math_text`
  - `TextPath.text_get_vertices_codes` (As an alternative, construct a new `TextPath` object.)

### Unused attributes

  - `NavigationToolbar2QT.buttons`
  - `Line2D.verticalOffset`
  - `Quiver.keytext`
  - `Quiver.keyvec`
  - `SpanSelector.buttonDown`

These are unused and never updated.

### Sphinx extensions

  - `matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl.math_directive`
  - `matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive.plot_directive`

This is because the `matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl` and `matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive` interfaces have changed from the (Sphinx-)deprecated function-based interface to a class-based interface; this should not affect end users.

  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axis_artist.UnimplementedException`

### Environmental Variables

  - The `MATPLOTLIBDATA` environment variable

### Axis

  - `Axis.iter_ticks`

This only served as a helper to the private `Axis._update_ticks`

## Undeprecations

The following API elements have been un-deprecated:

  - The *obj\_type* keyword argument to the `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation.deprecated` decorator.
  - *xmin*, *xmax* keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xlim</span> and *ymin*, *ymax* keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_ylim</span>

## New features

### <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> now has a `c` alias for the `color` property

For consistency with <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>, the <span class="title-ref">\~.text.Text</span> class has gained the `c` alias for the `color` property. For example, one can now write :

    ax.text(.5, .5, "foo", c="red")

### `Cn` colors now support `n>=10`

It is now possible to go beyond the tenth color in the property cycle using `Cn` syntax, e.g. :

    plt.plot([1, 2], color="C11")

now uses the 12th color in the cycle.

Note that previously, a construct such as:

    plt.plot([1, 2], "C11")

would be interpreted as a request to use color `C1` and marker `1` (an "inverted Y"). To obtain such a plot, one should now use :

    plt.plot([1, 2], "1C1")

(so that the first "1" gets correctly interpreted as a marker specification), or, more explicitly:

    plt.plot([1, 2], marker="1", color="C1")

### New <span class="title-ref">.Formatter.format\_ticks</span> method

The <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span> class gained a new <span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.format\_ticks</span> method, which takes the list of all tick locations as a single argument and returns the list of all formatted values. It is called by the axis tick handling code and, by default, first calls <span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.set\_locs</span> with all locations, then repeatedly calls `Formatter.__call__` for each location.

Tick-handling code in the codebase that previously performed this sequence (<span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.set\_locs</span> followed by repeated `Formatter.__call__`) have been updated to use <span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.format\_ticks</span>.

<span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.format\_ticks</span> is intended to be overridden by <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span> subclasses for which the formatting of a tick value depends on other tick values, such as <span class="title-ref">.ConciseDateFormatter</span>.

### Added support for RGB(A) images in pcolorfast

pcolorfast now accepts 3D images (RGB or RGBA) arrays if the X and Y specifications allow image or pcolorimage rendering; they remain unsupported by the more general quadmesh rendering

## Invalid inputs

Passing invalid locations to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.table</span> used to fallback on a default location. This behavior is deprecated and will throw an exception in a future version.

<span class="title-ref">.offsetbox.AnchoredText</span> is unable to handle the *horizontalalignment* or *verticalalignment* kwargs, and used to ignore them with a warning. This behavior is deprecated and will throw an exception in a future version.

Passing steps less than 1 or greater than 10 to <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.MaxNLocator</span> used to result in undefined behavior. It now throws a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

The signature of the (private) `Axis._update_ticks` has been changed to not take the renderer as argument anymore (that argument is unused).

# API Changes for 3.1.1

<div class="contents" data-local="" data-depth="1">

## Behavior changes

### Locator.nonsingular return order

<span class="title-ref">.Locator.nonsingular</span> (introduced in mpl 3.1) now returns a range `v0, v1` with `v0 <= v1`. This behavior is consistent with the implementation of `nonsingular` by the <span class="title-ref">.LogLocator</span> and <span class="title-ref">.LogitLocator</span> subclasses.

# Behavior changes

## Reduced default value of `axes.formatter.limits`

Changed the default value of `axes.formatter.limits` from -7, 7 to -5, 6 for better readability.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, (ax\_old, ax\_new) = plt.subplots(1, 2, constrained\_layout=True)

ax\_new.set\_title('new values (-5, 6)') ax\_old.set\_title('old values (-7, 7)')

x = np.logspace(-8, 8, 1024) y = 1e-5 \* np.exp(-x / 1e5) + 1e-6

ax\_old.xaxis.get\_major\_formatter().set\_powerlimits((-7, 7)) ax\_old.yaxis.get\_major\_formatter().set\_powerlimits((-7, 7))

  - for ax in \[ax\_new, ax\_old\]:  
    ax.plot(x, y) ax.set\_xlim(0, 1e6) ax.set\_ylim(1e-6, 1e-5)

</div>

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> uses un-normalized axes for all mappables

Before 3.0, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> (<span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.colorbar</span>) normalized all axes limits between 0 and 1 and had custom tickers to handle the labelling of the colorbar ticks. After 3.0, colorbars constructed from mappables that were *not* contours were constructed with axes that had limits between `vmin` and `vmax` of the mappable's norm, and the tickers were made children of the normal axes tickers.

This version of Matplotlib extends that to mappables made by contours, and allows the axes to run between the lowest boundary in the contour and the highest.

Code that worked around the normalization between 0 and 1 will need to be modified.

## `MovieWriterRegistry`

<span class="title-ref">.MovieWriterRegistry</span> now always checks the availability of the writer classes before returning them. If one wishes, for example, to get the first available writer, without performing the availability check on subsequent writers, it is now possible to iterate over the registry, which will yield the names of the available classes.

## Autoscaling

Matplotlib used to recompute autoscaled limits after every plotting (`plot()`, `bar()`, etc.) call. It now only does so when actually rendering the canvas, or when the user queries the Axes limits. This is a major performance improvement for plots with a large number of artists.

In particular, this means that artists added manually with <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_line</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_patch</span>, etc. will be taken into account by the autoscale, even without an explicit call to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.autoscale\_view</span>.

In some cases, this can result in different limits being reported. If this is an issue, consider triggering a draw with `fig.canvas.draw()`.

Autoscaling has also changed for artists that are based on the <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> class. Previously, the method that calculates the automatic limits <span class="title-ref">.Collection.get\_datalim</span> tried to take into account the size of objects in the collection and make the limits large enough to not clip any of the object, i.e., for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.scatter</span> it would make the limits large enough to not clip any markers in the scatter. This is problematic when the object size is specified in physical space, or figure-relative space, because the transform from physical units to data limits requires knowing the data limits, and becomes invalid when the new limits are applied. This is an inverse problem that is theoretically solvable (if the object is physically smaller than the axes), but the extra complexity was not deemed worth it, particularly as the most common use case is for markers in scatter that are usually small enough to be accommodated by the default data limit margins.

While the new behavior is algorithmically simpler, it is conditional on properties of the <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> object:

1.  `offsets = None`, `transform` is a child of `Axes.transData`: use the paths for the automatic limits (i.e. for <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span> in <span class="title-ref">.Axes.streamplot</span>).
2.  `offsets != None`, and `offset_transform` is child of `Axes.transData`:
    1)  `transform` is child of `Axes.transData`: use the `path + offset` for limits (i.e., for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.bar</span>).
    2)  `transform` is not a child of `Axes.transData`: just use the offsets for the limits (i.e. for scatter)
3.  otherwise return a null <span class="title-ref">.Bbox</span>.

While this seems complicated, the logic is simply to use the information from the object that are in data space for the limits, but not information that is in physical units.

## log-scale bar() / hist() autolimits

The autolimits computation in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.hist</span> when the axes already uses log-scale has changed to match the computation when the axes is switched to log-scale after the call to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.hist</span>, and when calling `bar(..., log=True)` / `hist(..., log=True)`: if there are at least two different bar heights, add the normal axes margins to them (in log-scale); if there is only a single bar height, expand the axes limits by one order of magnitude around it and then apply axes margins.

## Axes labels spanning multiple rows/columns

`Axes.label_outer` now correctly keep the x labels and tick labels visible for Axes spanning multiple rows, as long as they cover the last row of the Axes grid. (This is consistent with keeping the y labels and tick labels visible for Axes spanning multiple columns as long as they cover the first column of the Axes grid.)

The `Axes.is_last_row` and `Axes.is_last_col` methods now correctly return True for Axes spanning multiple rows, as long as they cover the last row or column respectively. Again this is consistent with the behavior for axes covering the first row or column.

The `Axes.rowNum` and `Axes.colNum` attributes are deprecated, as they only refer to the first grid cell covered by the Axes. Instead, use the new `ax.get_subplotspec().rowspan` and `ax.get_subplotspec().colspan` properties, which are <span class="title-ref">range</span> objects indicating the whole span of rows and columns covered by the subplot.

(Note that all methods and attributes mentioned here actually only exist on the `Subplot` subclass of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span>, which is used for grid-positioned Axes but not for Axes positioned directly in absolute coordinates.)

The <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> class gained the `nrows` and `ncols` properties as more explicit synonyms for the parameters returned by `GridSpec.get_geometry`.

## Locators

When more than <span class="title-ref">.Locator.MAXTICKS</span> ticks are generated, the behavior of <span class="title-ref">.Locator.raise\_if\_exceeds</span> changed from raising a RuntimeError to emitting a log at WARNING level.

## nonsingular Locators

`Locator.nonsingular` (introduced in mpl 3.1), `DateLocator.nonsingular`, and `AutoDateLocator.nonsingular` now returns a range `v0, v1` with `v0 <= v1`. This behavior is consistent with the implementation of `nonsingular` by the `LogLocator` and `LogitLocator` subclasses.

## `get_data_ratio`

`Axes.get_data_ratio` now takes the axes scale into account (linear, log, logit, etc.) before computing the y-to-x ratio. This change allows fixed aspects to be applied to any combination of x and y scales.

## Artist sticky edges

Previously, the `sticky_edges` attribute of artists was a list of values such that if an axis limit coincides with a sticky edge, it would not be expanded by the axes margins (this is the mechanism that e.g. prevents margins from being added around images).

`sticky_edges` now have an additional effect on margins application: even if an axis limit did not coincide with a sticky edge, it cannot *cross* a sticky edge through margin application -- instead, the margins will only expand the axis limit until it bumps against the sticky edge.

This change improves the margins of axes displaying a \`\~.Axes.streamplot\`:

  - if the streamplot goes all the way to the edges of the vector field, then the axis limits are set to match exactly the vector field limits (whereas they would sometimes be off by a small floating point error previously).
  - if the streamplot does not reach the edges of the vector field (e.g., due to the use of `start_points` and `maxlength`), then margins expansion will not cross the vector field limits anymore.

This change is also used internally to ensure that polar plots don't display negative *r* values unless the user really passes in a negative value.

## `gid` in svg output

Previously, if a figure, axis, legend or some other artists had a custom `gid` set (e.g. via `.set_gid()`), this would not be reflected in the svg output. Instead a default gid, like `figure_1` would be shown. This is now fixed, such that e.g. `fig.set_gid("myfigure")` correctly shows up as `<g id="myfigure">` in the svg file. If you relied on the gid having the default format, you now need to make sure not to set the `gid` parameter of the artists.

## Fonts

Font weight guessing now first checks for the presence of the FT\_STYLE\_BOLD\_FLAG before trying to match substrings in the font name. In particular, this means that Times New Roman Bold is now correctly detected as bold, not normal weight.

## Color-like checking

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.is\_color\_like</span> used to return True for all string representations of floats. However, only those with values in 0-1 are valid colors (representing grayscale values). <span class="title-ref">.is\_color\_like</span> now returns False for string representations of floats outside 0-1.

## Default image interpolation

Images displayed in Matplotlib previously used nearest-neighbor interpolation, leading to aliasing effects for downscaling and non-integer upscaling.

New default for `image.interpolation` is the new option "antialiased". `imshow(A, interpolation='antialiased')` will apply a Hanning filter when resampling the data in A for display (or saving to file) *if* the upsample rate is less than a factor of three, and not an integer; downsampled data is always smoothed at resampling.

To get the old behavior, set `image.interpolation` to the old default "nearest" (or specify the `interpolation` kwarg of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.imshow</span>)

To always get the anti-aliasing behavior, no matter what the up/down sample rate, set `image.interpolation` to "hanning" (or one of the other filters available).

Note that the "hanning" filter was chosen because it has only a modest performance penalty. Anti-aliasing can be improved with other filters.

## rcParams

When using <span class="title-ref">.RendererSVG</span> with `rcParams["svg.image_inline"] == True`, externally written images now use a single counter even if the `renderer.basename` attribute is overwritten, rather than a counter per basename.

This change will only affect you if you used `rcParams["svg.image_inline"] = True` (the default is False) *and* manually modified `renderer.basename`.

Changed the default value of `axes.formatter.limits` from -7, 7 to -5, 6 for better readability.

## `add_subplot()`

<span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_subplot()</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot()</span> do not accept a *figure* keyword argument anymore. It only used to work anyway if the passed figure was `self` or the current figure, respectively.

## `indicate_inset()`

In \<= 3.1.0, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate\_inset</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate\_inset\_zoom</span> were documented as returning a 4-tuple of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.ConnectionPatch</span>, where in fact they returned a 4-length list.

They now correctly return a 4-tuple. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate\_inset</span> would previously raise an error if the optional *inset\_ax* was not supplied; it now completes successfully, and returns *None* instead of the tuple of `ConnectionPatch`.

## PGF backend

The pgf backend's get\_canvas\_width\_height now returns the canvas size in display units rather than in inches, which it previously did. The new behavior is the correct one given the uses of `get_canvas_width_height` in the rest of the codebase.

The pgf backend now includes images using `\includegraphics` instead of `\pgfimage` if the version of `graphicx` is recent enough to support the `interpolate` option (this is detected automatically).

## <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook</span>

The default value of the "obj\_type" parameter to `cbook.warn_deprecated` has been changed from "attribute" (a default that was never used internally) to the empty string.

## Testing

The test suite no longer turns on the Python fault handler by default. Set the standard `PYTHONFAULTHANDLER` environment variable to do so.

## Backend `supports_blit`

Backends do not need to explicitly define the flag `supports_blit` anymore. This is only relevant for backend developers. Backends had to define the flag `supports_blit`. This is not needed anymore because the blitting capability is now automatically detected.

## Exception changes

Various APIs that raised a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> for incorrectly typed inputs now raise <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> instead: <span class="title-ref">.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase.set\_clip\_path</span>, `blocking_input.BlockingInput.__call__`, `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`, <span class="title-ref">.dviread.DviFont</span>, <span class="title-ref">.rcsetup.validate\_hatch</span>, `.rcsetup.validate_animation_writer_path`, <span class="title-ref">.spines.Spine</span>, many classes in the `matplotlib.transforms` module and `matplotlib.tri` package, and Axes methods that take a `norm` parameter.

If extra kwargs are passed to <span class="title-ref">.LogScale</span>, <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> will now be raised instead of <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

## mplot3d auto-registration

<span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d</span> is always registered by default now. It is no longer necessary to import mplot3d to create 3d axes with :

    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d")

## <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> now has a *base* parameter

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> had no *base* keyword argument and the base was hard-coded to `base=np.e`. This was inconsistent with the default behavior of <span class="title-ref">.SymmetricalLogScale</span> (which defaults to `base=10`) and the use of the word "decade" in the documentation.

In preparation for changing the default base to 10, calling <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> without the new *base* keyword argument emits a deprecation warning.

deprecations.md

---

# Deprecations

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span>

The `warn` parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use()</span> is deprecated (catch the <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span> emitted on backend switch failure and reemit a warning yourself if so desired).

## plotfile

`.pyplot.plotfile` is deprecated in favor of separately loading and plotting the data. Use pandas or NumPy to load data, and pandas or matplotlib to plot the resulting data.

## axes and axis

Setting `Axis.major.locator`, `Axis.minor.locator`, `Axis.major.formatter` or `Axis.minor.formatter` to an object that is not a subclass of <span class="title-ref">.Locator</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span> (respectively) is deprecated. Note that these attributes should usually be set using <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_major\_locator</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_minor\_locator</span>, etc. which already raise an exception when an object of the wrong class is passed.

Passing more than one positional argument or unsupported keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.axis()</span> is deprecated (such arguments used to be silently ignored).

## `minor` argument will become keyword-only

Using the parameter `minor` to `get_*ticks()` / `set_*ticks()` as a positional parameter is deprecated. It will become keyword-only in future versions.

## `axes_grid1`

The `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.colorbar` module and its colorbar implementation are deprecated in favor of `matplotlib.colorbar`, as the former is essentially abandoned and the latter is a more featureful replacement with a nearly compatible API (for example, the following additional keywords are supported: `panchor`, `extendfrac`, `extendrect`).

The main differences are:

  - Setting the ticks on the colorbar is done by calling `colorbar.set_ticks` rather than `colorbar.cbar_axis.set_xticks` or `colorbar.cbar_axis.set_yticks`; the `locator` parameter to `colorbar()` is deprecated in favor of its synonym `ticks` (which already existed previously, and is consistent with `matplotlib.colorbar`).
  - The colorbar's long axis is accessed with `colorbar.xaxis` or `colorbar.yaxis` depending on the orientation, rather than `colorbar.cbar_axis`.
  - The default ticker is no longer `MaxNLocator(5)`, but a `_ColorbarAutoLocator`.
  - Overdrawing multiple colorbars on top of one another in a single Axes (e.g. when using the `cax` attribute of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span> elements) is not supported; if you previously relied on the second colorbar being drawn over the first, you can call `cax.cla()` to clear the axes before drawing the second colorbar.

During the deprecation period, the `mpl_toolkits.legacy_colorbar` rcParam can be set to True to use `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.colorbar` in `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` code with a deprecation warning (the default), or to False to use `matplotlib.colorbar`.

Passing a `pad` size of `None` (the default) as a synonym for zero to the `append_axes`, `new_horizontal` and `new_vertical` methods of <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider.AxesDivider</span> is deprecated. In a future release, the default value of `None` will mean "use `figure.subplot.wspace` or `figure.subplot.hspace`" (depending on the orientation). Explicitly pass `pad=0` to keep the old behavior.

## Axes3D

`mplot3d.axis3d.get_flip_min_max` is deprecated.

`axes3d.unit_bbox` is deprecated (use `Bbox.unit` instead).

`axes3d.Axes3D.w_xaxis`, `.w_yaxis`, and `.w_zaxis` are deprecated (use `.xaxis`, `.yaxis`, and `.zaxis` instead).

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm</span>

`cm.revcmap` is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.Colormap.reversed</span> to reverse a colormap.

`cm.datad` no longer contains entries for reversed colormaps in their "unconverted" form.

## axisartist

`mpl_toolkits.axisartist.grid_finder.GridFinderBase` is deprecated (its only use is to be inherited by the <span class="title-ref">.GridFinder</span> class which just provides more defaults in the constructor and directly sets the transforms, so `GridFinderBase`'s methods were just moved to <span class="title-ref">.GridFinder</span>).

`axisartist.axis_artist.BezierPath` is deprecated (use <span class="title-ref">.patches.PathPatch</span> to draw arbitrary Paths).

`AxisArtist.line` is now a <span class="title-ref">.patches.PathPatch</span> instance instead of a `BezierPath` instance.

Returning a factor equal to None from axisartist Locators (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick Locators), or passing a factor equal to None to axisartist Formatters (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick Formatters) is deprecated. Pass a factor equal to 1 instead.

For the <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist.axis\_artist.AttributeCopier</span> class, the constructor and the `set_ref_artist` method, and the *default\_value* parameter of `get_attribute_from_ref_artist`, are deprecated.

Deprecation of the constructor means that classes inheriting from <span class="title-ref">.AttributeCopier</span> should no longer call its constructor.

## Locators

The unused `Locator.autoscale` method is deprecated (pass the axis limits to <span class="title-ref">.Locator.view\_limits</span> instead).

## Animation

The following methods and attributes of the <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriterRegistry</span> class are deprecated: `set_dirty`, `ensure_not_dirty`, `reset_available_writers`, `avail`.

## `smart_bounds()`

The "smart\_bounds" functionality is deprecated. This includes `Axis.set_smart_bounds()`, `Axis.get_smart_bounds()`, `Spine.set_smart_bounds()`, and `Spine.get_smart_bounds()`.

## `boxplot()`

Setting the `whis` parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.boxplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span> to "range" to mean "the whole data range" is deprecated; set it to (0, 100) (which gets interpreted as percentiles) to achieve the same effect.

## `fill_between()`

Passing scalars to parameter *where* in `fill_between()` and `fill_betweenx()` is deprecated. While the documentation already states that *where* must be of the same size as *x* (or *y*), scalars were accepted and broadcasted to the size of *x*. Non-matching sizes will raise a `ValueError` in the future.

## `scatter()`

Passing the *verts* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.scatter</span> is deprecated; use the *marker* parameter instead.

## `tight_layout()`

The `renderer` parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span> is deprecated; this method now always uses the renderer instance cached on the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span>.

## rcParams

The `rcsetup.validate_animation_writer_path` function is deprecated.

Setting `savefig.format` to "auto" is deprecated; use its synonym "png" instead.

Setting `text.hinting` to True or False is deprecated; use their synonyms "auto" or "none" instead.

`rcsetup.update_savefig_format` is deprecated.

`rcsetup.validate_path_exists` is deprecated (use `os.path.exists` to check whether a path exists).

`rcsetup.ValidateInterval` is deprecated.

## Dates

`dates.mx2num` is deprecated.

## TK

`NavigationToolbar2Tk.set_active` is deprecated, as it has no (observable) effect.

## WX

`FigureFrameWx.statusbar` and `NavigationToolbar2Wx.statbar` are deprecated. The status bar can be retrieved by calling standard wx methods (`frame.GetStatusBar()` and `toolbar.GetTopLevelParent().GetStatusBar()`).

`backend_wx.ConfigureSubplotsWx.configure_subplots` and `backend_wx.ConfigureSubplotsWx.get_canvas` are deprecated.

## PGF

`backend_pgf.repl_escapetext` and `backend_pgf.repl_mathdefault` are deprecated.

`RendererPgf.latexManager` is deprecated.

## FigureCanvas

`FigureCanvasBase.draw_cursor` (which has never done anything and has never been overridden in any backend) is deprecated.

`FigureCanvasMac.invalidate` is deprecated in favor of its synonym, `FigureCanvasMac.draw_idle`.

The `dryrun` parameter to the various `FigureCanvasFoo.print_foo` methods is deprecated.

## QuiverKey doc

`quiver.QuiverKey.quiverkey_doc` is deprecated; use `quiver.QuiverKey.__init__.__doc__` instead.

## <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.mlab</span>

`mlab.apply_window` and `mlab.stride_repeat` are deprecated.

## Fonts

`font_manager.JSONEncoder` is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.json\_dump</span> to dump a <span class="title-ref">.FontManager</span> instance.

`font_manager.createFontList` is deprecated. <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.FontManager.addfont</span> is now available to register a font at a given path.

The `as_str`, `as_rgba_str`, `as_array`, `get_width` and `get_height` methods of `matplotlib.ft2font.FT2Image` are deprecated. Convert the `FT2Image` to a NumPy array with `np.asarray` before processing it.

## Colors

The function `matplotlib.colors.makeMappingArray` is not considered part of the public API any longer. Thus, it's deprecated.

Using a string of single-character colors as a color sequence (e.g. "rgb") is deprecated. Use an explicit list instead.

## Scales

Passing unsupported keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">.ScaleBase</span>, and its subclasses <span class="title-ref">.LinearScale</span> and <span class="title-ref">.SymmetricalLogScale</span>, is deprecated and will raise a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> in 3.3.

If extra keyword arguments are passed to <span class="title-ref">.LogScale</span>, <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> will now be raised instead of <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

## Testing

The `matplotlib.testing.disable_internet` module is deprecated. Use (for example) [pytest-remotedata](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-remotedata/) instead.

Support in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.testing</span> for nose-based tests is deprecated (a deprecation is emitted if using e.g. the decorators from that module while both 1) matplotlib's conftests have not been called and 2) nose is in `sys.modules`).

`testing.is_called_from_pytest` is deprecated.

During the deprecation period, to force the generation of nose base tests, import nose first.

The *switch\_backend\_warn* parameter to `matplotlib.test` has no effect and is deprecated.

`testing.jpl_units.UnitDbl.UnitDbl.checkUnits` is deprecated.

## `DivergingNorm` renamed to `TwoSlopeNorm`

`DivergingNorm` was a misleading name; although the norm was developed with the idea that it would likely be used with diverging colormaps, the word 'diverging' does not describe or evoke the norm's mapping function. Since that function is monotonic, continuous, and piece-wise linear with two segments, the norm has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">.TwoSlopeNorm</span>

## Misc

`matplotlib.get_home` is deprecated (use e.g. `os.path.expanduser("~")`) instead.

`matplotlib.compare_versions` is deprecated (use comparison of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`s instead).

`matplotlib.checkdep_ps_distiller` is deprecated.

`matplotlib.figure.AxesStack` is considered private API and will be removed from the public API in future versions.

`BboxBase.is_unit` is deprecated (check the Bbox extents if needed).

`Affine2DBase.matrix_from_values(...)` is deprecated. Use (for example) `Affine2D.from_values(...).get_matrix()` instead.

`style.core.is_style_file` and `style.core.iter_style_files` are deprecated.

## The `datapath` rcParam

Use <span class="title-ref">.get\_data\_path</span> instead. (The rcParam is deprecated because it cannot be meaningfully set by an end user.) The rcParam had no effect from 3.2.0, but was deprecated only in 3.2.1. In 3.2.1+ if `'datapath'` is set in a `matplotlibrc` file it will be respected, but this behavior will be removed in 3.3.

# Development changes

## Windows build

Previously, when building the `matplotlib._png` extension, the build script would add "png" and "z" to the extensions `.libraries` attribute (if pkg-config information is not available, which is in particular the case on Windows).

In particular, this implies that the Windows build would look up files named `png.lib` and `z.lib`; but neither libpng upstream nor zlib upstream provides these files by default. (On Linux, this would look up `libpng.so` and `libz.so`, which are indeed standard names.)

Instead, on Windows, we now look up `libpng16.lib` and `zlib.lib`, which *are* the upstream names for the shared libraries (as of libpng 1.6.x).

For a statically-linked build, the upstream names are `libpng16_static.lib` and `zlibstatic.lib`; one still needs to manually rename them if such a build is desired.

## Packaging DLLs

Previously, it was possible to package Windows DLLs into the Matplotlib wheel (or sdist) by copying them into the source tree and setting the `package_data.dlls` entry in `setup.cfg`.

DLLs copied in the source tree are now always packaged; the `package_data.dlls` entry has no effect anymore. If you do not want to include the DLLs, don't copy them into the source tree.

The `required_interactive_framework` attribute of backend modules introduced in Matplotlib 3.0 has been moved to the `FigureCanvas` class, in order to let it be inherited by third-party canvas subclasses and to make it easier to know what interactive framework is required by a canvas class.

`backend_qt4.FigureCanvasQT5`, which is an alias for `backend_qt5.FigureCanvasQT` (but only exists under that name in `backend_qt4`), has been removed.

# Behaviour changes

## `Formatter.fix_minus`

<span class="title-ref">.Formatter.fix\_minus</span> now performs hyphen-to-unicode-minus replacement whenever `axes.unicode_minus` is True; i.e. its behavior matches the one of `ScalarFormatter.fix_minus` (<span class="title-ref">.ScalarFormatter</span> now just inherits that implementation).

This replacement is now used by the `format_data_short` method of the various builtin formatter classes, which affects the cursor value in the GUI toolbars.

## `FigureCanvasBase` now always has a `manager` attribute, which may be None

Previously, it did not necessarily have such an attribute. A check for `hasattr(figure.canvas, "manager")` should now be replaced by `figure.canvas.manager is not None` (or `getattr(figure.canvas, "manager", None) is not None` for back-compatibility).

## <span class="title-ref">.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> now propagates exceptions when no GUI event loop is running

<span class="title-ref">.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> now defaults to propagating exceptions thrown by callbacks when no interactive GUI event loop is running. If a GUI event loop *is* running, <span class="title-ref">.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> still defaults to just printing a traceback, as unhandled exceptions can make the program completely `abort()` in that case.

## `Axes.locator_params()` validates `axis` parameter

<span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.locator\_params</span> used to accept any value for `axis` and silently did nothing, when passed an unsupported value. It now raises a `ValueError`.

## `Axis.set_tick_params()` validates `which` parameter

<span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span> (and the higher level <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.tick\_params</span>) used to accept any value for `which` and silently did nothing, when passed an unsupported value. It now raises a `ValueError`.

## `Axis.set_ticklabels()` must match `FixedLocator.locs`

If an axis is using a <span class="title-ref">.ticker.FixedLocator</span>, typically set by a call to <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticks</span>, then the number of ticklabels supplied must match the number of locations available (`FixedFormattor.locs`). If not, a `ValueError` is raised.

## `backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex`

`backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex` is now created with `encoding="utf-8"`, so its `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` attributes are utf8-encoded.

## `pyplot.xticks()` and `pyplot.yticks()`

Previously, passing labels without passing the ticks to either <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.xticks</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.yticks</span> would result in:

    TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()

It now raises a `TypeError` with a proper description of the error.

## Setting the same property under multiple aliases now raises a TypeError

Previously, calling e.g. `plot(..., color=somecolor, c=othercolor)` would emit a warning because `color` and `c` actually map to the same Artist property. This now raises a TypeError.

## <span class="title-ref">.FileMovieWriter</span> temporary frames directory

<span class="title-ref">.FileMovieWriter</span> now defaults to writing temporary frames in a temporary directory, which is always cleared at exit. In order to keep the individual frames saved on the filesystem, pass an explicit *frame\_prefix*.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.plot</span> no longer accepts *x* and *y* being both 2D and with different numbers of columns

Previously, calling <span class="title-ref">.Axes.plot</span> e.g. with *x* of shape `(n, 3)` and *y* of shape `(n, 2)` would plot the first column of *x* against the first column of *y*, the second column of *x* against the second column of *y*, **and** the first column of *x* against the third column of *y*. This now raises an error instead.

## <span class="title-ref">.Text.update\_from</span> now copies usetex state from the source Text

## <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> now defaults to `use_line_collection=True`

This creates the stem plot as a <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span> rather than individual <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> objects, greatly improving performance.

## rcParams color validator is now stricter

Previously, rcParams entries whose values were color-like accepted "spurious" extra letters or characters in the "middle" of the string, e.g. `"(0, 1a, '0.5')"` would be interpreted as `(0, 1, 0.5)`. These extra characters (including the internal quotes) now cause a ValueError to be raised.

## <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> now has a *base* parameter

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> had no *base* keyword argument, and defaulted to `base=np.e` whereas the documentation said it was `base=10`. In preparation to make the default 10, calling <span class="title-ref">.SymLogNorm</span> without the new *base* keyword argument emits a deprecation warning.

## <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.errorbar</span> now color cycles when only errorbar color is set

Previously setting the *ecolor* would turn off automatic color cycling for the plot, leading to the the lines and markers defaulting to whatever the first color in the color cycle was in the case of multiple plot calls.

## <span class="title-ref">.rcsetup.validate\_color\_for\_prop\_cycle</span> now always raises TypeError for bytes input

It previously raised <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span>, **except** when the input was of the form `b"C[number]"` in which case it raised a ValueError.

## <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasPS.print\_ps</span> and <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasPS.print\_eps</span> no longer apply edgecolor and facecolor

These methods now assume that the figure edge and facecolor have been correctly applied by <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase.print\_figure</span>, as they are normally called through it.

This behavior is consistent with other figure saving methods (<span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasAgg.print\_png</span>, <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasPdf.print\_pdf</span>, <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasSVG.print\_svg</span>).

## <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot()</span> now raises TypeError when given an incorrect number of arguments

This is consistent with other signature mismatch errors. Previously a ValueError was raised.

## Shortcut for closing all figures

Shortcuts for closing all figures now also work for the classic toolbar. There is no default shortcut any more because unintentionally closing all figures by a key press might happen too easily. You can configure the shortcut yourself using `keymap.quit_all`.

## Autoscale for arrow

Calling ax.arrow() will now autoscale the axes.

## `set_tick_params(label1On=False)` now also makes the offset text (if any) invisible

... because the offset text can rarely be interpreted without tick labels anyways.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.annotate</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.annotate</span> parameter name changed

The parameter `s` to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.annotate</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.annotate</span> is renamed to `text`, matching <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span>.

The old parameter name remains supported, but support for it will be dropped in a future Matplotlib release.

## <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.json\_dump</span> now locks the font manager dump file

... to prevent multiple processes from writing to it at the same time.

## <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.rgrids</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.thetagrids</span> now act as setters also when called with only kwargs

Previously, keyword arguments were silently ignored when no positional arguments were given.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_minorticklabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_majorticklabels</span> now returns plain list

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_minorticklabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_majorticklabels</span> returns silent\_list. Their return type is now changed to normal list. <span class="title-ref">.get\_xminorticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.get\_yminorticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.get\_zminorticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_ticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.get\_xmajorticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.get\_ymajorticklabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.get\_zmajorticklabels</span> methods will be affected by this change.

## Default slider formatter

The default method used to format <span class="title-ref">.Slider</span> values has been changed to use a <span class="title-ref">.ScalarFormatter</span> adapted the slider values limits. This should ensure that values are displayed with an appropriate number of significant digits even if they are much smaller or much bigger than 1. To restore the old behavior, explicitly pass a "%1.2f" as the *valfmt* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Slider</span>.

## Add *normalize* keyword argument to `Axes.pie`

`pie()` used to draw a partial pie if the sum of the values was \< 1. This behavior is deprecated and will change to always normalizing the values to a full pie by default. If you want to draw a partial pie, please pass `normalize=False` explicitly.

## `table.CustomCell` is now an alias for <span class="title-ref">.table.Cell</span>

All the functionality of `CustomCell` has been moved to its base class <span class="title-ref">\~.table.Cell</span>.

## wx Timer interval

Setting the timer interval on a not-yet-started `TimerWx` won't start it anymore.

## "step"-type histograms default to the zorder of <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>

This ensures that they go above gridlines by default. The old `zorder` can be kept by passing it as a keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist</span>.

## <span class="title-ref">.Legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span> visibility

<span class="title-ref">.Legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span> subclasses (<span class="title-ref">.PaddedBox</span>, <span class="title-ref">.AnchoredOffsetbox</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.AnnotationBbox</span>) no longer directly keep track of the visibility of their underlying <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span> artist, but instead pass that flag down to the <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span>.

## <span class="title-ref">.Legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Table</span> no longer allow invalid locations

This affects legends produced on an Axes (<span class="title-ref">.Axes.legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.legend</span>) and on a Figure (<span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.figlegend</span>). Figure legends also no longer accept the unsupported `'best'` location. Previously, invalid Axes locations would use `'best'` and invalid Figure locations would used `'upper right'`.

## Passing Line2D's *drawstyle* together with *linestyle* is removed

Instead of `plt.plot(..., linestyle="steps--")`, use `plt.plot(..., linestyle="--", drawstyle="steps")`. `ds` is also an alias for `drawstyle`.

## Upper case color strings

Support for passing single-letter colors (one of "rgbcmykw") as UPPERCASE characters is removed; these colors are now case-sensitive (lowercase).

## tight/constrained\_layout no longer worry about titles that are too wide

*tight\_layout* and *constrained\_layout* shrink axes to accommodate "decorations" on the axes. However, if an xlabel or title is too long in the x direction, making the axes smaller in the x-direction doesn't help. The behavior of both has been changed to ignore the width of the title and xlabel and the height of the ylabel in the layout logic.

This also means there is a new keyword argument for <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.get\_tightbbox</span> and \`.axis.Axis.get\_tightbbox\`: `for_layout_only`, which defaults to *False*, but if *True* returns a bounding box using the rules above.

## `savefig.facecolor` and `savefig.edgecolor` now default to "auto"

This newly allowed value for `savefig.facecolor` and `savefig.edgecolor`, as well as the *facecolor* and *edgecolor* parameters to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span>, means "use whatever facecolor and edgecolor the figure current has".

## When using a single dataset, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist</span> no longer wraps the added artist in a <span class="title-ref">.silent\_list</span>

When <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist</span> is called with a single dataset, it adds to the axes either a <span class="title-ref">.BarContainer</span> object (when `histtype="bar"` or `"barstacked"`), or a <span class="title-ref">.Polygon</span> object (when `histype="step"` or `"stepfilled"`) -- the latter being wrapped in a list-of-one-element. Previously, either artist would be wrapped in a <span class="title-ref">.silent\_list</span>. This is no longer the case: the <span class="title-ref">.BarContainer</span> is now returned as is (this is an API breaking change if you were directly relying on the concrete <span class="title-ref">list</span> API; however, <span class="title-ref">.BarContainer</span> inherits from <span class="title-ref">tuple</span> so most common operations remain available), and the list-of-one <span class="title-ref">.Polygon</span> is returned as is. This makes the <span class="title-ref">repr</span> of the returned artist more accurate: it is now :

    <BarContainer object of 10 artists>  # "bar", "barstacked"
    [<matplotlib.patches.Polygon object at 0xdeadbeef>]  # "step", "stepfilled"

instead of :

    <a list of 10 Patch objects>  # "bar", "barstacked"
    <a list of 1 Patch objects>  # "step", "stepfilled"

When <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist</span> is called with multiple artists, it still wraps its return value in a <span class="title-ref">.silent\_list</span>, but uses more accurate type information :

    <a list of 3 BarContainer objects>  # "bar", "barstacked"
    <a list of 3 List[Polygon] objects>  # "step", "stepfilled"

instead of :

    <a list of 3 Lists of Patches objects>  # "bar", "barstacked"
    <a list of 3 Lists of Patches objects>  # "step", "stepfilled"

## Qt and wx backends no longer create a status bar by default

The coordinates information is now displayed in the toolbar, consistently with the other backends. This is intended to simplify embedding of Matplotlib in larger GUIs, where Matplotlib may control the toolbar but not the status bar.

## `text.hinting` now supports names mapping to FreeType flags

`text.hinting` now supports the values "default", "no\_autohint", "force\_autohint", and "no\_hinting", which directly map to the FreeType flags FT\_LOAD\_DEFAULT, etc. The old synonyms (respectively "either", "native", "auto", and "none") are still supported, but their use is discouraged. To get normalized values, use <span class="title-ref">.backend\_agg.get\_hinting\_flag</span>, which returns integer flag values.

## <span class="title-ref">.cbook.get\_sample\_data</span> auto-loads numpy arrays

When <span class="title-ref">.cbook.get\_sample\_data</span> is used to load a npy or npz file and the keyword-only parameter `np_load` is True, the file is automatically loaded using <span class="title-ref">numpy.load</span>. `np_load` defaults to False for backwards compatibility, but will become True in a later release.

## `get_text_width_height_descent` now checks `ismath` rather than `text.usetex`

... to determine whether a string should be passed to the usetex machinery or not. This allows single strings to be marked as not-usetex even when the rcParam is True.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.vlines</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hlines</span>, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.vlines</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.hlines</span> *colors* parameter default change

The *colors* parameter will now default to `lines.color`, while previously it defaulted to 'k'.

## Aggressively autoscale clim in `ScalerMappable` classes

Previously some plotting methods would defer autoscaling until the first draw if only one of the *vmin* or *vmax* keyword arguments were passed (<span class="title-ref">.Axes.scatter</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hexbin</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.imshow</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolorfast</span>) but would scale based on the passed data if neither was passed (independent of the *norm* keyword arguments). Other methods (<span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolor</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolormesh</span>) always autoscaled base on the initial data.

All of the plotting methods now resolve the unset *vmin* or *vmax* at the initial call time using the data passed in.

If you were relying on exactly one of the *vmin* or *vmax* remaining unset between the time when the method is called and the first time the figure is rendered you get back the old behavior by manually setting the relevant limit back to <span class="title-ref">None</span> :

    cm_obj.norm.vmin = None
    # or
    cm_obj.norm.vmax = None

which will be resolved during the draw process.

# Deprecations

## `figure.add_axes()` without arguments

Calling `fig.add_axes()` with no arguments currently does nothing. This call will raise an error in the future. Adding a free-floating axes needs a position rectangle. If you want a figure-filling single axes, use `add_subplot()` instead.

## `backend_wx.DEBUG_MSG`

`backend_wx.DEBUG_MSG` is deprecated. The wx backends now use regular logging.

## `Colorbar.config_axis()`

`Colorbar.config_axis()` is considered internal. Its use is deprecated.

## `NonUniformImage.is_grayscale` and `PcolorImage.is_grayscale`

These attributes are deprecated, for consistency with `AxesImage.is_grayscale`, which was removed back in Matplotlib 2.0.0. (Note that previously, these attributes were only available *after rendering the image*).

## `den` parameter and attribute to `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.angle_helper`

For all locator classes defined in `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.angle_helper`, the `den` parameter has been renamed to `nbins`, and the `den` attribute deprecated in favor of its (preexisting) synonym `nbins`, for consistency with locator classes defined in `matplotlib.ticker`.

## `backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex_stdin_utf8`

`backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex` is now created with `encoding="utf-8"`, so its `stdin` attribute is already utf8-encoded; the `latex_stdin_utf8` attribute is thus deprecated.

## Flags containing "U" passed to <span class="title-ref">.cbook.to\_filehandle</span> and <span class="title-ref">.cbook.open\_file\_cm</span>

Please remove "U" from flags passed to <span class="title-ref">.cbook.to\_filehandle</span> and <span class="title-ref">.cbook.open\_file\_cm</span>. This is consistent with their removal from <span class="title-ref">open</span> in Python 3.9.

## PDF and PS character tracking internals

The `used_characters` attribute and `track_characters` and `merge_used_characters` methods of <span class="title-ref">.RendererPdf</span>, <span class="title-ref">.PdfFile</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.RendererPS</span> are deprecated.

## Case-insensitive capstyles and joinstyles

Please pass capstyles ("miter", "round", "bevel") and joinstyles ("butt", "round", "projecting") as lowercase.

## Passing raw data to `register_cmap()`

Passing raw data via parameters *data* and *lut* to `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap()` is deprecated. Instead, explicitly create a <span class="title-ref">.LinearSegmentedColormap</span> and pass it via the *cmap* parameter: `register_cmap(cmap=LinearSegmentedColormap(name, data, lut))`.

## `DateFormatter.illegal_s`

This attribute is unused and deprecated.

## `widgets.TextBox.params_to_disable`

This attribute is deprecated.

## Revert deprecation \*min, \*max keyword arguments to `set_x/y/zlim_3d()`

These keyword arguments were deprecated in 3.0, alongside with the respective parameters in `set_xlim()` / `set_ylim()`. The deprecations of the 2D versions were already reverted in 3.1.

## `cbook.local_over_kwdict`

This function is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span> instead.

## Passing both singular and plural *colors*, *linewidths*, *linestyles* to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.eventplot</span>

Passing e.g. both *linewidth* and *linewidths* will raise a TypeError in the future.

## Setting `text.latex.preamble` or `pdf.preamble` rcParams to non-strings

These rcParams should be set to string values. Support for None (meaning the empty string) and lists of strings (implicitly joined with newlines) is deprecated.

## Parameters *norm* and *vmin*/*vmax* should not be used simultaneously

Passing parameters *norm* and *vmin*/*vmax* simultaneously to functions using colormapping such as `scatter()` and `imshow()` is deprecated. Instead of `norm=LogNorm(), vmin=min_val, vmax=max_val` pass `norm=LogNorm(min_val, max_val)`. *vmin* and *vmax* should only be used without setting *norm*.

## Effectless parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span>

The *cmap* and *norm* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> have no effect because they are always overridden by the mappable's colormap and norm; they are thus deprecated. Likewise, passing the *alpha*, *boundaries*, *values*, *extend*, or *filled* parameters with a <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> mappable, or the *alpha* parameter with an <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> mappable, is deprecated, as the mappable would likewise override them.

## `args_key` and `exec_key` attributes of builtin <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriter</span>s

These attributes are deprecated.

## Unused parameters

The following parameters do not have any effect and are deprecated:

  - arbitrary keyword arguments to `StreamplotSet`
  - parameter *quantize* of <span class="title-ref">.Path.cleaned()</span>
  - parameter *s* of <span class="title-ref">.AnnotationBbox.get\_fontsize()</span>
  - parameter *label* of <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span>

## Passing *props* to <span class="title-ref">.Shadow</span>

The parameter *props* of <span class="title-ref">.Shadow</span> is deprecated. Use keyword arguments instead.

## `Axes.update_datalim_bounds`

This method is deprecated. Use `ax.dataLim.set(Bbox.union([ax.dataLim, bounds]))` instead.

## `{,Symmetrical}LogScale.{,Inverted}LogTransform`

`LogScale.LogTransform`, `LogScale.InvertedLogTransform`, `SymmetricalScale.SymmetricalTransform` and `SymmetricalScale.InvertedSymmetricalTransform` are deprecated. Directly access the transform classes from the `.scale` module.

## `TexManager.cachedir`, `TexManager.rgba_arrayd`

Use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.get\_cachedir()</span> instead for the former; there is no replacement for the latter.

## Setting <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>'s pickradius via <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_picker</span>

Setting a <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>'s pickradius (i.e. the tolerance for pick events and containment checks) via <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_picker</span> is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_pickradius</span> instead.

<span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_picker</span> no longer sets the artist's custom-contain() check.

## `Artist.set_contains`, `Artist.get_contains`

Setting a custom method overriding <span class="title-ref">.Artist.contains</span> is deprecated. There is no replacement, but you may still customize pick events using <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_picker</span>.

## <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> methods

The `on_mappable_changed` and `update_bruteforce` methods of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> are deprecated; both can be replaced by calls to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar.update\_normal</span>.

## `OldScalarFormatter`, `IndexFormatter` and `IndexDateFormatter`

These formatters are deprecated. Their functionality can be implemented using e.g. <span class="title-ref">.FuncFormatter</span>.

## `OldAutoLocator`

This ticker is deprecated.

## *required*, *forbidden* and *allowed* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span>

These parameters are deprecated.

## The `TTFPATH` and `AFMPATH` environment variables

Support for the (undocumented) `TTFPATH` and `AFMPATH` environment variables is deprecated. Additional fonts may be registered using `matplotlib.font_manager.fontManager.addfont()`.

## `matplotlib.compat`

This module is deprecated.

## `matplotlib.backends.qt_editor.formsubplottool`

This module is deprecated. Use `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.SubplotToolQt` instead.

## AVConv animation writer deprecated

The `AVConvBase`, `AVConvWriter` and `AVConvFileWriter` classes, and the associated `animation.avconv_path` and `animation.avconv_args` rcParams are deprecated.

Debian 8 (2015, EOL 06/2020) and Ubuntu 14.04 (EOL 04/2019) were the last versions of Debian and Ubuntu to ship avconv. It remains possible to force the use of avconv by using the ffmpeg-based writers with `animation.ffmpeg_path` set to "avconv".

## log/symlog scale base, ticks, and nonpos specification

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.semilogx</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.semilogy</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.loglog</span>, <span class="title-ref">.LogScale</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.SymmetricalLogScale</span> used to take keyword arguments that depends on the axis orientation ("basex" vs "basey", "subsx" vs "subsy", "nonposx" vs "nonposy"); these parameter names are now deprecated in favor of "base", "subs", "nonpositive". This deprecation also affects e.g. `ax.set_yscale("log", basey=...)` which must now be spelled `ax.set_yscale("log", base=...)`.

The change from "nonpos" to "nonpositive" also affects <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.LogTransform</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.InvertedLogTransform</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.SymmetricalLogTransform</span>, etc.

To use *different* bases for the x-axis and y-axis of a <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.loglog</span> plot, use e.g. `ax.set_xscale("log", base=10); ax.set_yscale("log", base=2)`.

## `DraggableBase.artist_picker`

This method is deprecated. If you previously reimplemented it in a subclass, set the artist's picker instead with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_picker</span>.

## *clear\_temp* parameter and attribute of <span class="title-ref">.FileMovieWriter</span>

The *clear\_temp* parameter and attribute of <span class="title-ref">.FileMovieWriter</span> is deprecated. In the future, files placed in a temporary directory (using `frame_prefix=None`, the default) will be cleared; files placed elsewhere will not.

## Deprecated rcParams validators

The following validators, defined in <span class="title-ref">.rcsetup</span>, are deprecated: `validate_fontset`, `validate_mathtext_default`, `validate_alignment`, `validate_svg_fonttype`, `validate_pgf_texsystem`, `validate_movie_frame_fmt`, `validate_axis_locator`, `validate_movie_html_fmt`, `validate_grid_axis`, `validate_axes_titlelocation`, `validate_toolbar`, `validate_ps_papersize`, `validate_legend_loc`, `validate_bool_maybe_none`, `validate_hinting`, `validate_movie_writer`, `validate_webagg_address`, `validate_nseq_float`, `validate_nseq_int`. To test whether an rcParam value would be acceptable, one can test e.g. `rc = RcParams(); rc[k] = v` raises an exception.

## Stricter rcParam validation

`axes.axisbelow` currently normalizes all strings starting with "line" (case-insensitive) to the option "line". This is deprecated; in a future version only the exact string "line" (case-sensitive) will be supported.

## `add_subplot()` validates its inputs

In particular, for `add_subplot(rows, cols, index)`, all parameters must be integral. Previously strings and floats were accepted and converted to int. This will now emit a deprecation warning.

## Toggling axes navigation from the keyboard using "a" and digit keys

Axes navigation can still be toggled programmatically using <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_navigate</span>.

The following related APIs are also deprecated: `backend_tools.ToolEnableAllNavigation`, `backend_tools.ToolEnableNavigation`, and `rcParams["keymap.all_axes"]`.

## `matplotlib.test(recursionlimit=...)`

The *recursionlimit* parameter of `matplotlib.test` is deprecated.

## mathtext glues

The *copy* parameter of `mathtext.Glue` is deprecated (the underlying glue spec is now immutable). `mathtext.GlueSpec` is deprecated.

## Signatures of <span class="title-ref">.Artist.draw</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span>

The *inframe* parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span> is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.Axes.redraw\_in\_frame</span> instead.

Not passing the *renderer* parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span> is deprecated. Use `axes.draw_artist(axes)` instead.

These changes make the signature of the `draw` (`artist.draw(renderer)`) method consistent across all artists; thus, additional parameters to <span class="title-ref">.Artist.draw</span> are deprecated.

## `DraggableBase.on_motion_blit`

This method is deprecated. <span class="title-ref">.DraggableBase.on\_motion</span> now handles both the blitting and the non-blitting cases.

## Passing the dash offset as None

Fine control of dash patterns can be achieved by passing an `(offset, (on-length, off-length, on-length, off-length, ...))` pair as the linestyle property of <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> and <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span>. Previously, certain APIs would accept `offset = None` as a synonym for `offset = 0`, but this was never universally implemented, e.g. for vector output. Support for `offset = None` is deprecated, set the offset to 0 instead.

## `RendererCairo.fontweights`, `RendererCairo.fontangles`

... are deprecated.

## `autofmt_xdate(which=None)`

This is deprecated, use its more explicit synonym, `which="major"`, instead.

## JPEG options

The *quality*, *optimize*, and *progressive* keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span>, which were only used when saving to JPEG, are deprecated. The `savefig.jpeg_quality` rcParam is likewise deprecated.

Such options should now be directly passed to Pillow using `savefig(..., pil_kwargs={"quality": ..., "optimize": ..., "progressive": ...})`.

## `dviread.Encoding`

This class was (mostly) broken and is deprecated.

## Axis and Locator `pan` and `zoom`

The unused `pan` and `zoom` methods of <span class="title-ref">\~.axis.Axis</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.Locator</span> are deprecated. Panning and zooming are now implemented using the `start_pan`, `drag_pan`, and `end_pan` methods of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span>.

## Passing None to various Axes subclass factories

Support for passing `None` as base class to `axes.subplot_class_factory`, `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.host_axes_class_factory`, `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.host_subplot_class_factory`, `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.parasite_axes_class_factory`, and `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.parasite_axes_auxtrans_class_factory` is deprecated. Explicitly pass the correct base `Axes` class instead.

## `axes_rgb`

In `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.axes_rgb`, `imshow_rgb` is deprecated (use `ax.imshow(np.dstack([r, g, b]))` instead); `RGBAxesBase` is deprecated (use `RGBAxes` instead); `RGBAxes.add_RGB_to_figure` is deprecated (it was an internal helper).

## `Substitution.from_params`

This method is deprecated. If needed, directly assign to the `params` attribute of the Substitution object.

## PGF backend cleanups

The *dummy* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.RendererPgf</span> is deprecated.

`GraphicsContextPgf` is deprecated (use <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase</span> instead).

## `set_factor` method of `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` locators

The `set_factor` method of `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` locators (which are different from "standard" Matplotlib tick locators) is deprecated.

## <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SubplotTool</span> callbacks and axes

The `funcleft`, `funcright`, `funcbottom`, `functop`, `funcwspace`, and `funchspace` methods of <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SubplotTool</span> are deprecated.

The `axleft`, `axright`, `axbottom`, `axtop`, `axwspace`, and `axhspace` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SubplotTool</span> are deprecated. Access the `ax` attribute of the corresponding slider, if needed.

## mathtext `Glue` helper classes

The `Fil`, `Fill`, `Filll`, `NegFil`, `NegFill`, `NegFilll`, and `SsGlue` classes in the `matplotlib.mathtext` module are deprecated. As an alternative, directly construct glue instances with `Glue("fil")`, etc.

## NavigationToolbar2.\_init\_toolbar

Overriding this method to initialize third-party toolbars is deprecated. Instead, the toolbar should be initialized in the `__init__` method of the subclass (which should call the base-class' `__init__` as appropriate). To keep back-compatibility with earlier versions of Matplotlib (which *required* `_init_toolbar` to be overridden), a fully empty implementation (`def _init_toolbar(self): pass`) may be kept and will not trigger the deprecation warning.

## NavigationToolbar2QT.parent and .basedir

These attributes are deprecated. In order to access the parent window, use `toolbar.canvas.parent()`. Once the deprecation period is elapsed, it will also be accessible as `toolbar.parent()`. The base directory to the icons is `os.path.join(mpl.get_data_path(), "images")`.

## NavigationToolbar2QT.ctx

This attribute is deprecated.

## NavigationToolbar2Wx attributes

The `prevZoomRect`, `retinaFix`, `savedRetinaImage`, `wxoverlay`, `zoomAxes`, `zoomStartX`, and `zoomStartY` attributes are deprecated.

## NavigationToolbar2.press and .release

These methods were called when pressing or releasing a mouse button, but *only* when an interactive pan or zoom was occurring (contrary to what the docs stated). They are deprecated; if you write a backend which needs to customize such events, please directly override `press_pan`/`press_zoom`/`release_pan`/`release_zoom` instead.

## FigureCanvasGTK3.\_renderer\_init

Overriding this method to initialize renderers for GTK3 canvases is deprecated. Instead, the renderer should be initialized in the `__init__` method of the subclass (which should call the base-class' `__init__` as appropriate). To keep back-compatibility with earlier versions of Matplotlib (which *required* `_renderer_init` to be overridden), a fully empty implementation (`def _renderer_init(self): pass`) may be kept and will not trigger the deprecation warning.

## Path helpers in `.bezier`

`bezier.make_path_regular` is deprecated. Use `Path.cleaned()` (or `Path.cleaned(curves=True)`, etc.) instead (but note that these methods add a `STOP` code at the end of the path).

`bezier.concatenate_paths` is deprecated. Use `Path.make_compound_path()` instead.

## `animation.html_args` rcParam

The unused `animation.html_args` rcParam and `animation.HTMLWriter.args_key` attribute are deprecated.

## `text.latex.preview` rcParam

This rcParam, which controlled the use of the preview.sty LaTeX package to align TeX string baselines, is deprecated, as Matplotlib's own dvi parser now computes baselines just as well as preview.sty.

## `SubplotSpec.get_rows_columns`

This method is deprecated. Use the `GridSpec.nrows`, `GridSpec.ncols`, `SubplotSpec.rowspan`, and `SubplotSpec.colspan` properties instead.

## Qt4-based backends

The qt4agg and qt4cairo backends are deprecated. Qt4 has reached its end-of-life in 2015 and there are no releases for recent versions of Python. Please consider switching to Qt5.

## *fontdict* and *minor* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xticklabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_yticklabels</span> will become keyword-only

## All parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplots</span> except *nrows* and *ncols* will become keyword-only

This avoids typing e.g. `subplots(1, 1, 1)` when meaning `subplot(1, 1, 1)`, but actually getting `subplots(1, 1, sharex=1)`.

## `RendererWx.get_gc`

This method is deprecated. Access the `gc` attribute directly instead.

## *add\_all* parameter in `axes_grid`

The *add\_all* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.Grid</span>, <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span>, <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_rgb.make\_rgb\_axes</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_rgb.RGBAxes</span> is deprecated. Axes are now always added to the parent figure, though they can be later removed with `ax.remove()`.

## `BboxBase.inverse_transformed`

`.BboxBase.inverse_transformed` is deprecated (call <span class="title-ref">.BboxBase.transformed</span> on the <span class="title-ref">\~.Transform.inverted()</span> transform instead).

## *orientation* of `eventplot()` and <span class="title-ref">.EventCollection</span>

Setting the *orientation* of an `eventplot()` or <span class="title-ref">.EventCollection</span> to "none" or None is deprecated; set it to "horizontal" instead. Moreover, the two orientations ("horizontal" and "vertical") will become case-sensitive in the future.

## *minor* kwarg to <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_ticklocs</span> will become keyword-only

Passing this argument positionally is deprecated.

## Case-insensitive properties

Normalization of upper or mixed-case property names to lowercase in <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Artist.update</span> is deprecated. In the future, property names will be passed as is, allowing one to pass names such as *patchA* or *UVC*.

## `ContourSet.ax`, `Quiver.ax`

These attributes are deprecated in favor of `ContourSet.axes` and `Quiver.axes`, for consistency with other artists.

## `Locator.refresh()` and associated methods

`Locator.refresh()` is deprecated. This method was called at certain places to let locators update their internal state, typically based on the axis limits. Locators should now always consult the axis limits when called, if needed.

The associated helper methods `NavigationToolbar2.draw()` and `ToolViewsPositions.refresh_locators()` are deprecated, and should be replaced by calls to `draw_idle()` on the corresponding canvas.

## <span class="title-ref">.ScalarMappable</span> checkers

The `add_checker` and `check_update` methods and `update_dict` attribute of <span class="title-ref">.ScalarMappable</span> are deprecated.

## <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.tight\_layout</span> and `ColorbarBase` parameters will become keyword-only

All parameters of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.tight\_layout</span> and all parameters of `ColorbarBase` except for the first (*ax*) will become keyword-only, consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span> and `Colorbar`, respectively.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span> radius and startangle

Passing `None` as either the `radius` or `startangle` of an <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span> is deprecated; use the explicit defaults of 1 and 0, respectively, instead.

## `AxisArtist.dpi_transform`

... is deprecated. Scale `Figure.dpi_scale_trans` by 1/72 to achieve the same effect.

## `offset_position` property of <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>

The `offset_position` property of <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> is deprecated. In the future, <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>s will always behave as if `offset_position` is set to "screen" (the default).

Support for passing `offset_position="data"` to the `draw_path_collection` of all renderer classes is deprecated.

<span class="title-ref">.transforms.AffineDeltaTransform</span> can be used as a replacement. This API is experimental and may change in the future.

## `testing.compare.make_external_conversion_command`

... is deprecated.

## `epoch2num` and `num2epoch` are deprecated

These are unused and can be easily reproduced by other date tools. <span class="title-ref">.get\_epoch</span> will return Matplotlib's epoch.

## `axes_grid1.CbarAxes` attributes

The `cbid` and `locator` attribute are deprecated. Use `mappable.colorbar_cid` and `colorbar.locator`, as for standard colorbars.

## `qt_compat.is_pyqt5`

This function is deprecated in prevision of the future release of PyQt6. The Qt version can be checked using `QtCore.qVersion()`.

## Reordering of parameters by <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set</span>

In a future version, `Artist.set` will apply artist properties in the order in which they are given. This only affects the interaction between the *color*, *edgecolor*, *facecolor*, and, for <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>s, *alpha* properties: the *color* property now needs to be passed first in order not to override the other properties. This is consistent with e.g. <span class="title-ref">.Artist.update</span>, which did not reorder the properties passed to it.

## Passing multiple keys as a single comma-separated string or multiple arguments to <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager.update\_keymap</span>

This is deprecated; pass keys as a list of strings instead.

## Statusbar classes and attributes

The `statusbar` attribute of <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span>, `StatusbarBase` and all its subclasses, and `StatusBarWx`, are deprecated, as messages are now displayed in the toolbar instead.

## `ismath` parameter of `draw_tex`

The `ismath` parameter of the `draw_tex` method of all renderer classes is deprecated (as a call to `draw_tex` -- not to be confused with `draw_text`\! -- means that the entire string should be passed to the `usetex` machinery anyways). Likewise, the text machinery will no longer pass the `ismath` parameter when calling `draw_tex` (this should only matter for backend implementers).

Passing `ismath="TeX!"` to <span class="title-ref">.RendererAgg.get\_text\_width\_height\_descent</span> is deprecated. Pass `ismath="TeX"` instead, consistently with other low-level APIs which support the values True, False, and "TeX" for `ismath`.

## `matplotlib.ttconv`

This module is deprecated.

## Stricter PDF metadata keys in PGF

Saving metadata in PDF with the PGF backend currently normalizes all keys to lowercase, unlike the PDF backend, which only accepts the canonical case. This is deprecated; in a future version, only the canonically cased keys listed in the PDF specification (and the <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span> documentation) will be accepted.

## Qt modifier keys

The `MODIFIER_KEYS`, `SUPER`, `ALT`, `CTRL`, and `SHIFT` global variables of the `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4agg`, `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt4cairo`, `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5agg` and `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5cairo` modules are deprecated.

## `TexManager`

The `TexManager.serif`, `TexManager.sans_serif`, `TexManager.cursive` and `TexManager.monospace` attributes are deprecated.

# Development changes

## Matplotlib now requires numpy\>=1.15

## Matplotlib now uses Pillow to save and read pngs

The builtin png encoder and decoder has been removed, and Pillow is now a dependency. Note that when reading 16-bit RGB(A) images, Pillow truncates them to 8-bit precision, whereas the old builtin decoder kept the full precision.

The deprecated wx backend (not wxagg\!) now always uses wx's builtin jpeg and tiff support rather than relying on Pillow for writing these formats; this behavior is consistent with wx's png output.

## Arguments

  - `Axes.text()` / `pyplot.text()` do not support the parameter `withdash` anymore. Use `Axes.annotate()` and `pyplot.annotate()` instead.
  - The first parameter of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span> has been renamed from `arg` to `backend` (only relevant if you pass by keyword).
  - The parameter `warn` of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span> has been removed. A failure to switch the backend will now always raise an `ImportError` if `force` is set; catch that error if necessary.
  - All parameters of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.use</span> except the first one are now keyword-only.
  - The unused parameters `shape` and `imlim` of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.imshow()</span> are now removed. All parameters beyond `extent` are now keyword-only.
  - The unused parameter `interp_at_native` of <span class="title-ref">.BboxImage</span> has been removed.
  - The parameter `usetex` of <span class="title-ref">.TextToPath.get\_text\_path</span> has been removed. Use `ismath='TeX'` instead.
  - The parameter `block` of `show()` is now keyword-only, and arbitrary arguments or keyword arguments are no longer accepted.
  - The parameter `frameon` of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span> has been removed. Use `facecolor="none"` to get a transparent background.
  - Passing a `wx.EvtHandler` as the first argument to `backend_wx.TimerWx` is not supported anymore; the signature of `TimerWx` is now consistent with <span class="title-ref">.TimerBase</span>.
  - The `manage_xticks` parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> has been renamed to `manage_ticks`.
  - The `normed` parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.hist2d</span> has been renamed to `density`.
  - The `s` parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Annotation</span> has been renamed to `text`.
  - For all functions in <span class="title-ref">.bezier</span> that supported a `tolerance` parameter, this parameter has been renamed to `tolerance`.
  - `axis("normal")` is not supported anymore. Use the equivalent `axis("auto")` instead.
  - `axis()` does not accept arbitrary keyword arguments anymore.
  - `Axis.set_ticklabels()` does not accept arbitrary positional arguments other than `ticklabels`.
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Poly3DCollection.set_zsort` does not accept the value `True` anymore. Pass the equivalent value 'average' instead.
  - <span class="title-ref">.AnchoredText</span> no longer accepts `horizontalalignment` or `verticalalignment` keyword arguments.
  - <span class="title-ref">.ConnectionPatch</span> no longer accepts the `arrow_transmuter` and `connector` keyword arguments, which did nothing since 3.0.
  - <span class="title-ref">.FancyArrowPatch</span> no longer accepts the `arrow_transmuter` and `connector` keyword arguments, which did nothing since 3.0.
  - <span class="title-ref">.TextPath</span> no longer accepts arbitrary positional or keyword arguments.
  - <span class="title-ref">.MaxNLocator.set\_params()</span> no longer accepts arbitrary keyword arguments.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pie</span> no longer accepts and squeezes non-1D inputs; pass 1D input to the `x` argument.
  - Passing (n, 1)-shaped error arrays to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar()</span> is no longer supported; pass a 1D array instead.

## rcParams

  - The `text.latex.unicode` rcParam has been removed, with no replacement. Matplotlib now always supports unicode in usetex.
  - The `savefig.frameon` rcParam has been removed. Set `savefig.facecolor` to "none" to get a transparent background.
  - The `pgf.debug`, `verbose.fileo` and `verbose.verbose.level` rcParams, which had no effect, have been removed.
  - Support for setting `mathtext.default` to "circled" has been removed.

## Environment variables

  - `MATPLOTLIBDATA` (no replacement).

## mathtext

  - The `\stackrel` command (which behaved differently from its LaTeX version) has been removed. Use `\genfrac` instead.
  - The `\mathcircled` command has been removed. Directly use Unicode characters, such as `'\N{CIRCLED LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A}'`, instead.

# API Changes for 3.3.1

## Deprecations

### Reverted deprecation of `num2epoch` and `epoch2num`

These two functions were deprecated in 3.3.0, and did not return an accurate Matplotlib datenum relative to the new Matplotlib epoch handling (<span class="title-ref">\~.dates.get\_epoch</span> and `date.epoch`). This version reverts the deprecation.

### Functions `epoch2num` and `dates.julian2num` use `date.epoch` rcParam

Now `epoch2num` and (undocumented) `julian2num` return floating point days since <span class="title-ref">\~.dates.get\_epoch</span> as set by `date.epoch`, instead of floating point days since the old epoch of "0000-12-31T00:00:00". If needed, you can translate from the new to old values as `old = new + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))`

# Behaviour changes

## Constrained layout rewrite

The layout manager `constrained_layout` was re-written with different outer constraints that should be more robust to complicated subplot layouts. User-facing changes are:

  - some poorly constrained layouts will have different width/height plots than before.
  - colorbars now respect the `anchor` keyword argument of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar.make\_axes</span>
  - colorbars are wider.
  - colorbars in different rows or columns line up more robustly.
  - *hspace* and *wspace* options to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.set\_constrained\_layout\_pads</span> were twice as wide as the docs said they should be. So these now follow the docs.

This feature will remain "experimental" until the new changes have been used enough by users, so we anticipate version 3.5 or 3.6. On the other hand, `constrained_layout` is extensively tested and used in examples in the library, so using it should be safe, but layouts may not be exactly the same as more development takes place.

Details of using `constrained_layout`, and its algorithm are available at \[constrainedlayout\_guide\](\#constrainedlayout\_guide)

## `plt.subplot` re-selection without keyword arguments

The purpose of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> is to facilitate creating and re-selecting Axes in a Figure when working strictly in the implicit pyplot API. When creating new Axes it is possible to select the projection (e.g. polar, 3D, or various cartographic projections) as well as to pass additional keyword arguments through to the Axes-subclass that is created.

The first time <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> is called for a given position in the Axes grid it always creates and returns a new Axes with the passed arguments and projection (defaulting to rectilinear). On subsequent calls to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> we have to determine if an existing Axes has a) equivalent parameters, in which case it should be selected as the current Axes and returned, or b) different parameters, in which case a new Axes is created and the existing Axes is removed. This leaves the question of what is "equivalent parameters".

Previously it was the case that an existing Axes subclass, except for Axes3D, would be considered equivalent to a 2D rectilinear Axes, despite having different projections, if the keyword arguments (other than *projection*) matched. Thus:

    ax1 = plt.subplot(1, 1, 1, projection='polar')
    ax2 =  plt.subplots(1, 1, 1)
    ax1 is ax2

We are embracing this long standing behavior to ensure that in the case when no keyword arguments (of any sort) are passed to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> any existing Axes is returned, without consideration for keywords or projection used to initially create it. This will cause a change in behavior when additional keywords were passed to the original Axes:

    ax1 = plt.subplot(111, projection='polar', theta_offset=.75)
    ax2 = plt.subplots(1, 1, 1)
    ax1 is ax2         # new behavior
    # ax1 is not ax2   # old behavior, made a new axes
    
    ax1 = plt.subplot(111, label='test')
    ax2 = plt.subplots(1, 1, 1)
    ax1 is ax2         # new behavior
    # ax1 is not ax2   # old behavior, made a new axes

For the same reason, if there was an existing Axes that was not rectilinear, passing `projection='rectilinear'` would reuse the existing Axes :

    ax1 = plt.subplot(projection='polar')
    ax2 = plt.subplot(projection='rectilinear')
    ax1 is not ax2     # new behavior, makes new Axes
    # ax1 is ax2       # old behavior

contrary to the user's request.

Previously Axes3D could not be re-selected with <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> due to an unrelated bug (also fixed in Matplotlib 3.4). While Axes3D are now consistent with all other projections there is a change in behavior for :

    plt.subplot(projection='3d')  # create a 3D Axes
    
    plt.subplot()                 # now returns existing 3D Axes, but
                                  # previously created new 2D Axes
    
    plt.subplot(projection='rectilinear')  # to get a new 2D Axes

## `ioff` and `ion` can be used as context managers

<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.ion</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.ioff</span> may now be used as context managers to create a context with interactive mode on or off, respectively. The old behavior of calling these functions is maintained. To use the new functionality call as:

    with plt.ioff():
       # non-interactive code

## Locators and formatters must be in the class hierarchy

Axis locators and formatters must now be subclasses of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Formatter</span> respectively.

## Date locator for DAILY interval now returns middle of month

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.AutoDateLocator</span> has a default of `interval_multiples=True` that attempts to align ticks with the start of meaningful intervals like the start of the month, or start of the day, etc. That lead to approximately 140-day intervals being mapped to the first and 22nd of the month. This has now been changed so that it chooses the first and 15th of the month, which is probably what most people want.

## `ScalarFormatter` *useLocale* option obeys grouping

When the <span class="title-ref">\~.ScalarFormatter</span> option *useLocale* is enabled (or `axes.formatter.use_locale` is *True*) and the configured locale uses grouping, a separator will be added as described in <span class="title-ref">locale.format\_string</span>.

## `Axes.errorbar` cycles non-color properties correctly

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span> incorrectly skipped the Axes property cycle if a color was explicitly specified, even if the property cycler was for other properties (such as line style). Now, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span> will advance the Axes property cycle as done for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.plot</span>, i.e., as long as all properties in the cycler are not explicitly passed.

## pyplot.specgram always uses origin='upper'

Previously if `image.origin` was set to something other than `'upper'` or if the *origin* keyword argument was passed with a value other than `'upper'`, the spectrogram itself would flip, but the Axes would remain oriented for an origin value of `'upper'`, so that the resulting plot was incorrectly labelled.

Now, the *origin* keyword argument is not supported and the `image.origin` rcParam is ignored. The function <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.specgram</span> is forced to use `origin='upper'`, so that the Axes are correct for the plotted spectrogram.

## xunits=None and yunits=None passed as keyword arguments are treated as "no action"

Many (but not all) of the methods on <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> take the (undocumented) keyword arguments *xunits* and *yunits* that will update the units on the given Axis by calling <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_units</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.update\_units</span>.

Previously if *None* was passed it would clear the value stored in `.Axis.units` which will in turn break converters which rely on the value in `.Axis.units` to work properly (notably <span class="title-ref">.StrCategoryConverter</span>).

This changes the semantics of `ax.meth(..., xunits=None, yunits=None)` from "please clear the units" to "do the default thing as if they had not been passed" which is consistent with the standard behavior of Matplotlib keyword arguments.

If you were relying on passing `xunits=None` to plotting methods to clear the `.Axes.units` attribute, directly call <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_units</span> (and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.update\_units</span> if you also require the converter to be updated).

## Annotations with `annotation_clip` no longer affect `tight_layout`

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.text.Annotation.get\_tightbbox</span> always returned the full <span class="title-ref">.text.Annotation.get\_window\_extent</span> of the object, independent of the value of `annotation_clip`. <span class="title-ref">.text.Annotation.get\_tightbbox</span> now correctly takes this extra clipping box into account, meaning that <span class="title-ref">\~.text.Annotation</span>s that are not drawn because of `annotation_clip` will not count towards the Axes bounding box calculations, such as those done by <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.tight\_layout</span>.

This is now consistent with the API described in <span class="title-ref">\~.artist.Artist</span>, which specifies that `get_window_extent` should return the full extents and `get_tightbbox` should "account for any clipping".

## Parasite Axes pcolor and pcolormesh now defaults to placing grid edges at integers, not half-integers

This is consistent with <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span>.

## `Colorbar` outline is now a `Spine`

The outline of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> is now a <span class="title-ref">.Spine</span> and drawn as one, instead of a <span class="title-ref">.Polygon</span> drawn as an artist. This ensures it will always be drawn after (i.e., on top of) all artists, consistent with Spines on normal Axes.

## `Colorbar.dividers` changes

This attribute is now always a <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span> -- an empty one if `drawedges` is *False*. Its default colors and linewidth (`axes.edgecolor`, `axes.linewidth`) are now resolved at instantiation time, not at draw time.

## Raise or warn on registering a colormap twice

When using `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap` to register a user provided or third-party colormap it will now raise a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span> if trying to over-write one of the built in colormaps and warn if trying to over write a user registered colormap. This may raise for user-registered colormaps in the future.

## Consecutive rasterized draws now merged

Tracking of depth of raster draws has moved from <span class="title-ref">.backend\_mixed.MixedModeRenderer.start\_rasterizing</span> and <span class="title-ref">.backend\_mixed.MixedModeRenderer.stop\_rasterizing</span> into <span class="title-ref">.artist.allow\_rasterization</span>. This means the start and stop functions are only called when the rasterization actually needs to be started and stopped.

The output of vector backends will change in the case that rasterized elements are merged. This should not change the appearance of outputs.

The renders in 3rd party backends are now expected to have `self._raster_depth` and `self._rasterizing` initialized to `0` and *False* respectively.

## Consistent behavior of `draw_if_interactive()` across backends

<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.draw\_if\_interactive</span> no longer shows the window (if it was previously unshown) on the Tk and nbAgg backends, consistently with all other backends.

## The Artist property *rasterized* cannot be *None* anymore

It is now a boolean only. Before the default was *None* and <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_rasterized</span> was documented to accept *None*. However, *None* did not have a special meaning and was treated as *False*.

## Canvas's callback registry now stored on Figure

The canonical location of the <span class="title-ref">\~.cbook.CallbackRegistry</span> used to handle Figure/Canvas events has been moved from the Canvas to the Figure. This change should be transparent to almost all users, however if you are swapping switching the Figure out from on top of a Canvas or visa versa you may see a change in behavior.

## Harmonized key event data across backends

The different backends with key translation support, now handle "Shift" as a sometimes modifier, where the `'shift+'` prefix won't be added if a key translation was made.

In the Qt5 backend, the `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.SPECIAL_KEYS` dictionary contains keys that do *not* return their unicode name instead they have manually specified names. The name for `QtCore.Qt.Key_Meta` has changed to `'meta'` to be consistent with the other GUI backends.

The WebAgg backend now handles key translations correctly on non-US keyboard layouts.

In the GTK and Tk backends, the handling of non-ASCII keypresses (as reported in the KeyEvent passed to `key_press_event`-handlers) now correctly reports Unicode characters (e.g., €), and better respects NumLock on the numpad.

In the GTK and Tk backends, the following key names have changed; the new names are consistent with those reported by the Qt backends:

  - The "Break/Pause" key (keysym 0xff13) is now reported as `"pause"` instead of `"break"` (this is also consistent with the X key name).
  - The numpad "delete" key is now reported as `"delete"` instead of `"dec"`.

## WebAgg backend no longer reports a middle click as a right click

Previously when using the WebAgg backend the event passed to a callback by `fig.canvas.mpl_connect('mouse_button_event', callback)` on a middle click would report <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton.RIGHT</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton.MIDDLE</span>.

## ID attribute of XML tags in SVG files now based on SHA256 rather than MD5

Matplotlib generates unique ID attributes for various tags in SVG files. Matplotlib previously generated these unique IDs using the first 10 characters of an MD5 hash. The MD5 hashing algorithm is not available in Python on systems with Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) enabled. Matplotlib now uses the first 10 characters of an SHA256 hash instead. SVG files that would otherwise match those saved with earlier versions of matplotlib, will have different ID attributes.

## `RendererPS.set_font` is no longer a no-op in AFM mode

<span class="title-ref">.RendererPS.set\_font</span> now sets the current PostScript font in all cases.

## Autoscaling in Axes3D

In Matplotlib 3.2.0, autoscaling was made lazier for 2D Axes, i.e., limits would only be recomputed when actually rendering the canvas, or when the user queries the Axes limits. This performance improvement is now extended to <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span>. This also fixes some issues with autoscaling being triggered unexpectedly in Axes3D.

Please see \[the API change for 2D Axes \<api-changes-3-2-0-autoscaling\>\](\#the-api-change-for-2d-axes-\<api-changes-3-2-0-autoscaling\>) for further details.

## Axes3D automatically adding itself to Figure is deprecated

New <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span> objects previously added themselves to figures when they were created, unlike all other Axes classes, which lead to them being added twice if `fig.add_subplot(111, projection='3d')` was called.

This behavior is now deprecated and will warn. The new keyword argument *auto\_add\_to\_figure* controls the behavior and can be used to suppress the warning. The default value will change to *False* in Matplotlib 3.5, and any non-*False* value will be an error in Matplotlib 3.6.

In the future, <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span> will need to be explicitly added to the figure :

    fig = Figure()
    # create Axes3D
    ax = Axes3d(fig)
    # add to Figure
    fig.add_axes(ax)

as needs to be done for other <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes</span> sub-classes. Or, a 3D projection can be made via:

    fig.add_subplot(projection='3d')

## `mplot3d.art3d.get_dir_vector` always returns NumPy arrays

For consistency, <span class="title-ref">\~.mplot3d.art3d.get\_dir\_vector</span> now always returns NumPy arrays, even if the input is a 3-element iterable.

## Changed cursive and fantasy font definitions

The Comic Sans and Comic Neue fonts were moved from the default `font.fantasy` list to the default `font.cursive` setting, in accordance with the CSS font families [example](https://www.w3.org/Style/Examples/007/fonts.en.html) and in order to provide a cursive font present in Microsoft's Core Fonts set.

## docstring.Substitution now always dedents docstrings before string interpolation

deprecations.md

---

# Deprecations

## Extra parameters to Axes constructor

Parameters of the Axes constructor other than *fig* and *rect* will become keyword-only in a future version.

## `pyplot.gca` and `Figure.gca` keyword arguments

Passing keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.gca</span> or <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.gca</span> will not be supported in a future release.

## `Axis.cla`, `RadialAxis.cla`, `ThetaAxis.cla` and `Spine.cla`

These methods are deprecated in favor of the respective `clear()` methods.

## Invalid hatch pattern characters are no longer ignored

When specifying hatching patterns, characters that are not recognized will raise a deprecation warning. In the future, this will become a hard error.

## `imread` reading from URLs

Passing a URL to <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.imread()</span> is deprecated. Please open the URL for reading and directly use the Pillow API (`PIL.Image.open(urllib.request.urlopen(url))`, or `PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(requests.get(url).content))`) instead.

## Subplot-related attributes and methods

Some `SubplotBase` methods and attributes have been deprecated and/or moved to \`.SubplotSpec\`:

  - `get_geometry` (use `SubplotBase.get_subplotspec` instead),
  - `change_geometry` (use `SubplotBase.set_subplotspec` instead),
  - `is_first_row`, `is_last_row`, `is_first_col`, `is_last_col` (use the corresponding methods on the <span class="title-ref">.SubplotSpec</span> instance instead),
  - `update_params` (now a no-op),
  - `figbox` (use `ax.get_subplotspec().get_geometry(ax.figure)` instead to recompute the geometry, or `ax.get_position()` to read its current value),
  - `numRows`, `numCols` (use the `nrows` and `ncols` attribute on the <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> instead).

Likewise, the `get_geometry`, `change_geometry`, `update_params`, and `figbox` methods/attributes of <span class="title-ref">.SubplotDivider</span> have been deprecated, with similar replacements.

## `is_url` and `URL_REGEX`

... are deprecated. (They were previously defined in the toplevel `matplotlib` module.)

## `matplotlib.style.core` deprecations

`STYLE_FILE_PATTERN`, `load_base_library`, and `iter_user_libraries` are deprecated.

## `dpi_cor` property of <span class="title-ref">.FancyArrowPatch</span>

This parameter is considered internal and deprecated.

## Passing `boxstyle="custom", bbox_transmuter=...` to `FancyBboxPatch`

In order to use a custom boxstyle, directly pass it as the *boxstyle* argument to <span class="title-ref">.FancyBboxPatch</span>. This was previously already possible, and is consistent with custom arrow styles and connection styles.

## BoxStyles are now called without passing the *mutation\_aspect* parameter

Mutation aspect is now handled by the artist itself. Hence the *mutation\_aspect* parameter of `BoxStyle._Base.__call__` is deprecated, and custom boxstyles should be implemented to not require this parameter (it can be left as a parameter defaulting to 1 for back-compatibility).

## `ContourLabeler.get_label_coords` is deprecated

It is considered an internal helper.

## Line2D and Patch no longer duplicate `validJoin` and `validCap`

Validation of joinstyle and capstyles is now centralized in `rcsetup`.

## Setting a Line2D's pickradius via `set_picker` is undeprecated

This cancels the deprecation introduced in Matplotlib 3.3.0.

## `MarkerStyle` is considered immutable

`MarkerStyle.set_fillstyle()` and `MarkerStyle.set_marker()` are deprecated. Create a new `MarkerStyle` with the respective parameters instead.

## `MovieWriter.cleanup` is deprecated

Cleanup logic is now fully implemented in <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriter.finish</span>. Third-party movie writers should likewise move the relevant cleanup logic there, as overridden `cleanup`s will no longer be called in the future.

## *minimumdescent* parameter/property of `TextArea`

<span class="title-ref">.offsetbox.TextArea</span> has behaved as if *minimumdescent* was always True (regardless of the value to which it was set) since Matplotlib 1.3, so the parameter/property is deprecated.

## `colorbar` now warns when the mappable's Axes is different from the current Axes

Currently, <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.colorbar</span> steal space by default from the current Axes to place the colorbar. In a future version, they will steal space from the mappable's Axes instead. In preparation for this change, <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.colorbar</span> now emits a warning when the current Axes is not the same as the mappable's Axes.

## Colorbar docstrings

The following globals in `matplotlib.colorbar` are deprecated: `colorbar_doc`, `colormap_kw_doc`, `make_axes_kw_doc`.

## `ColorbarPatch` and `colorbar_factory` are deprecated

All the relevant functionality has been moved to the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colorbar.Colorbar</span> class.

## Backend deprecations

  - `FigureCanvasBase.get_window_title` and `FigureCanvasBase.set_window_title` are deprecated. Use the corresponding methods on the FigureManager if using pyplot, or GUI-specific methods if embedding.
  - The *resize\_callback* parameter to `FigureCanvasTk` was never used internally and is deprecated. Tk-level custom event handlers for resize events can be added to a `FigureCanvasTk` using e.g. `get_tk_widget().bind('<Configure>', ..., True)`.
  - The `key_press` and `button_press` methods of <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span>, which incorrectly did nothing when using `toolmanager`, are deprecated in favor of directly passing the event to the <span class="title-ref">.CallbackRegistry</span> via `self.canvas.callbacks.process(event.name, event)`.
  - `RendererAgg.get_content_extents` and `RendererAgg.tostring_rgba_minimized` are deprecated.
  - `backend_pgf.TmpDirCleaner` is deprecated, with no replacement.
  - `GraphicsContextPS` is deprecated. The PostScript backend now uses <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase</span>.

## wx backend cleanups

The *origin* parameter to `_FigureCanvasWxBase.gui_repaint` is deprecated with no replacement; `gui_repaint` now automatically detects the case where it is used with the wx renderer.

The `NavigationToolbar2Wx.get_canvas` method is deprecated; directly instantiate a canvas (`FigureCanvasWxAgg(frame, -1, figure)`) if needed.

## Unused positional parameters to `print_<fmt>` methods are deprecated

None of the `print_<fmt>` methods implemented by canvas subclasses used positional arguments other that the first (the output filename or file-like), so these extra parameters are deprecated.

## The *dpi* parameter of `FigureCanvas.print_foo` printers is deprecated

The <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span> machinery already took care of setting the figure DPI to the desired value, so `print_foo` can directly read it from there. Not passing *dpi* to `print_foo` allows clearer detection of unused parameters passed to <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span>.

## Passing <span class="title-ref">bytes</span> to `FT2Font.set_text`

... is deprecated, pass <span class="title-ref">str</span> instead.

## `ps.useafm` deprecated for mathtext

Outputting mathtext using only standard PostScript fonts has likely been broken for a while (issue [\#18722](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18722)). In Matplotlib 3.5, the setting `ps.useafm` will have no effect on mathtext.

## `MathTextParser("bitmap")` is deprecated

The associated APIs `MathtextBackendBitmap`, `MathTextParser.to_mask`, `MathTextParser.to_rgba`, `MathTextParser.to_png`, and `MathTextParser.get_depth` are likewise deprecated.

To convert a text string to an image, either directly draw the text to an empty <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> and save the figure using a tight bbox, as demonstrated in \[/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/mathtext\_asarray\](/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/mathtext\_asarray.md), or use <span class="title-ref">.mathtext.math\_to\_image</span>.

When using <span class="title-ref">.math\_to\_image</span>, text color can be set with e.g.:

    with plt.rc_context({"text.color": "tab:blue"}):
        mathtext.math_to_image(text, filename)

and an RGBA array can be obtained with e.g.:

    from io import BytesIO
    buf = BytesIO()
    mathtext.math_to_image(text, buf, format="png")
    buf.seek(0)
    rgba = plt.imread(buf)

## Deprecation of mathtext internals

The following API elements previously exposed by the `.mathtext` module are considered to be implementation details and public access to them is deprecated:

  - `Fonts` and all its subclasses,
  - `FontConstantsBase` and all its subclasses,
  - `Node` and all its subclasses,
  - `Ship`, `ship`,
  - `Error`,
  - `Parser`,
  - `SHRINK_FACTOR`, `GROW_FACTOR`,
  - `NUM_SIZE_LEVELS`,
  - `latex_to_bakoma`, `latex_to_cmex`, `latex_to_standard`,
  - `stix_virtual_fonts`,
  - `tex2uni`.

## Deprecation of various mathtext helpers

The `MathtextBackendPdf`, `MathtextBackendPs`, `MathtextBackendSvg`, and `MathtextBackendCairo` classes from the `.mathtext` module, as well as the corresponding `.mathtext_parser` attributes on `RendererPdf`, `RendererPS`, `RendererSVG`, and `RendererCairo`, are deprecated. The `MathtextBackendPath` class can be used to obtain a list of glyphs and rectangles in a mathtext expression, and renderer-specific logic should be directly implemented in the renderer.

`StandardPsFonts.pswriter` is unused and deprecated.

## Widget class internals

Several <span class="title-ref">.widgets.Widget</span> class internals have been privatized and deprecated:

  - `AxesWidget.cids`
  - `Button.cnt` and `Button.observers`
  - `CheckButtons.cnt` and `CheckButtons.observers`
  - `RadioButtons.cnt` and `RadioButtons.observers`
  - `Slider.cnt` and `Slider.observers`
  - `TextBox.cnt`, `TextBox.change_observers` and `TextBox.submit_observers`

## 3D properties on renderers

The properties of the 3D Axes that were placed on the Renderer during draw are now deprecated:

  - `renderer.M`
  - `renderer.eye`
  - `renderer.vvec`
  - `renderer.get_axis_position`

These attributes are all available via <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span>, which can be accessed via `self.axes` on all <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s.

## *renderer* argument of `do_3d_projection` method for `Collection3D`/`Patch3D`

The *renderer* argument for the `do_3d_projection` method on `Collection3D` and `Patch3D` is no longer necessary, and passing it during draw is deprecated.

## *project* argument of `draw` method for `Line3DCollection`

The *project* argument for the `draw` method on `Line3DCollection` is deprecated. Call <span class="title-ref">.Line3DCollection.do\_3d\_projection</span> explicitly instead.

## Extra positional parameters to `plot_surface` and `plot_wireframe`

Positional parameters to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_wireframe</span> other than `X`, `Y`, and `Z` are deprecated. Pass additional artist properties as keyword arguments instead.

## `ParasiteAxesAuxTransBase` class

The functionality of that mixin class has been moved to the base `ParasiteAxesBase` class. Thus, `ParasiteAxesAuxTransBase`, `ParasiteAxesAuxTrans`, and `parasite_axes_auxtrans_class_factory` are deprecated.

In general, it is suggested to use `HostAxes.get_aux_axes` to create parasite Axes, as this saves the need of manually appending the parasite to `host.parasites` and makes sure that their `remove()` method works properly.

## `AxisArtist.ZORDER` attribute

Use `AxisArtist.zorder` instead.

## `GridHelperBase` invalidation

The `GridHelperBase.invalidate`, `GridHelperBase.valid`, and `axislines.Axes.invalidate_grid_helper` methods are considered internal and deprecated.

## `sphinext.plot_directive.align`

... is deprecated. Use `docutils.parsers.rst.directives.images.Image.align` instead.

## Deprecation-related functionality is considered internal

The module `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation` is considered internal and will be removed from the public API. This also holds for deprecation-related re-imports in `matplotlib.cbook`, i.e. `matplotlib.cbook.deprecated()`, `matplotlib.cbook.warn_deprecated()`, `matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` and `matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation`.

If needed, external users may import `MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` directly from the `matplotlib` namespace. `mplDeprecation` is only an alias of `MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` and should not be used anymore.

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy) and [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

## Qhull downloaded at build-or-sdist time

Much like FreeType, Qhull is now downloaded at build time, or upon creation of the sdist. To link against system Qhull, set the `system_qhull` option to <span class="title-ref">True</span> in the `setup.cfg` file. Note that Matplotlib now requires the re-entrant version of Qhull (`qhull_r`).

## `FigureBase` class added, and `Figure` class made a child

The new subfigure feature motivated some re-organization of the <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure</span> class, so that the new <span class="title-ref">.figure.SubFigure</span> class could have all the capabilities of a figure.

The <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure</span> class is now a subclass of <span class="title-ref">.figure.FigureBase</span>, where <span class="title-ref">.figure.FigureBase</span> contains figure-level artist addition routines, and the <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure</span> subclass just contains features that are unique to the outer figure.

Note that there is a new *transSubfigure* transform associated with the subfigure. This transform also exists for a <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> instance, and is equal to *transFigure* in that case, so code that uses the transform stack that wants to place objects on either the parent figure or one of the subfigures should use *transSubfigure*.

# Removals

The following deprecated APIs have been removed:

## Removed behaviour

  - The "smart bounds" functionality on <span class="title-ref">\~.axis.Axis</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Spine</span> has been deleted, and the related methods have been removed.
  - Converting a string with single color characters (e.g. `'cymk'`) in <span class="title-ref">\~.colors.to\_rgba\_array</span> is no longer supported. Instead, the colors can be passed individually in a list (e.g. `['c', 'y', 'm', 'k']`).
  - Returning a factor equal to `None` from `mpl_toolkits.axisartist` Locators (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick Locators), or passing a factor equal to `None` to axisartist Formatters (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick Formatters) is no longer supported. Pass a factor equal to 1 instead.

## Modules

  - The entire `matplotlib.testing.disable_internet` module has been removed. The [pytest-remotedata package](https://github.com/astropy/pytest-remotedata) can be used instead.
  - The `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1.colorbar` module and its colorbar implementation have been removed in favor of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colorbar</span>.

## Classes, methods and attributes

  - The <span class="title-ref">.animation.MovieWriterRegistry</span> methods `.set_dirty()`, `.ensure_not_dirty()`, and `.reset_available_writers()` do nothing and have been removed. The `.avail()` method has been removed; use `.list()` instead to get a list of available writers.
  - The `matplotlib.artist.Artist.eventson` and `matplotlib.container.Container.eventson` attributes have no effect and have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.axes.Axes.get_data_ratio_log` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.axes.SubplotBase.rowNum`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().rowspan.start` instead.
  - `matplotlib.axes.SubplotBase.colNum`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().colspan.start` instead.
  - `matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_smart_bounds` and `matplotlib.axis.Axis.get_smart_bounds` have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.colors.DivergingNorm` has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.TwoSlopeNorm</span>.
  - `matplotlib.figure.AxesStack` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.font_manager.JSONEncoder` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.json\_dump</span> to dump a <span class="title-ref">.FontManager</span> instance.
  - The `matplotlib.ft2font.FT2Image` methods `.as_array()`, `.as_rgba_str()`, `.as_str()`, `.get_height()` and `.get_width()` have been removed. Convert the `FT2Image` to a NumPy array with `np.asarray` before processing it.
  - `matplotlib.quiver.QuiverKey.quiverkey_doc` has been removed; use `matplotlib.quiver.QuiverKey.__init__.__doc__` instead.
  - `matplotlib.spines.Spine.set_smart_bounds` and `matplotlib.spines.Spine.get_smart_bounds` have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.testing.jpl_units.UnitDbl.checkUnits` has been removed; use `units not in self.allowed` instead.
  - The unused `matplotlib.ticker.Locator.autoscale` method has been removed (pass the axis limits to <span class="title-ref">.Locator.view\_limits</span> instead). The derived methods `Locator.autoscale`, `AutoDateLocator.autoscale`, `RRuleLocator.autoscale`, `RadialLocator.autoscale`, `ThetaLocator.autoscale`, and `YearLocator.autoscale` have also been removed.
  - `matplotlib.transforms.BboxBase.is_unit` has been removed; check the <span class="title-ref">.Bbox</span> extents if needed.
  - `matplotlib.transforms.Affine2DBase.matrix_from_values(...)` has been removed; use (for example) `Affine2D.from_values(...).get_matrix()` instead.
  - `matplotlib.backend_bases.FigureCanvasBase.draw_cursor` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk.ConfigureSubplotsGTK3.destroy` and `matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk.ConfigureSubplotsGTK3.init_window` methods have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk.ConfigureSubplotsGTK3.window` property has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_macosx.FigureCanvasMac.invalidate` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_pgf.RendererPgf.latexManager` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.FigureFrameWx.statusbar`, `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.NavigationToolbar2Wx.set_status_bar`, and `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.NavigationToolbar2Wx.statbar` have been removed. The status bar can be retrieved by calling standard wx methods (`frame.GetStatusBar()` and `toolbar.GetTopLevelParent().GetStatusBar()`).
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.ConfigureSubplotsWx.configure_subplots` and `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.ConfigureSubplotsWx.get_canvas` have been removed.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.grid_finder.GridFinderBase` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.GridFinder</span> instead.
  - `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axis_artist.BezierPath` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.patches.PathPatch</span> instead.

  - `matplotlib.checkdep_ps_distiller` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.cm.revcmap` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.Colormap.reversed</span> instead.
  - `matplotlib.colors.makeMappingArray` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.compare_versions` has been removed; use comparison of `distutils.version.LooseVersion`s instead.
  - `matplotlib.dates.mx2num` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.font_manager.createFontList` has been removed; <span class="title-ref">.font\_manager.FontManager.addfont</span> is now available to register a font at a given path.
  - `matplotlib.get_home` has been removed; use standard library instead.
  - `matplotlib.mlab.apply_window` and `matplotlib.mlab.stride_repeat` have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.rcsetup.update_savefig_format` has been removed; this just replaced `'auto'` with `'png'`, so do the same.
  - `matplotlib.rcsetup.validate_animation_writer_path` has been removed.
  - `matplotlib.rcsetup.validate_path_exists` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">os.path.exists</span> or <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path.exists</span> instead.
  - `matplotlib.style.core.is_style_file` and `matplotlib.style.core.iter_style_files` have been removed.
  - `matplotlib.testing.is_called_from_pytest` has been removed.
  - `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.unit_bbox` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.Bbox.unit</span> instead.

## Arguments

  - Passing more than one positional argument to <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.axis</span> will now raise an error.
  - Passing `"range"` to the *whis* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.boxplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span> to mean "the whole data range" is no longer supported.
  - Passing scalars to the *where* parameter in <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.fill\_between</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.fill\_betweenx</span> is no longer accepted and non-matching sizes now raise a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.
  - The *verts* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.scatter</span> has been removed; use *marker* instead.
  - The *minor* parameter in <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticks</span> and `SecondaryAxis.set_ticks` is now keyword-only.
  - <span class="title-ref">.scale.ScaleBase</span>, <span class="title-ref">.scale.LinearScale</span> and <span class="title-ref">.scale.SymmetricalLogScale</span> now error if any unexpected keyword arguments are passed to their constructors.
  - The *renderer* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span> has been removed; this method now always uses the renderer instance cached on the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span>.
  - The *locator* parameter to <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.CbarAxesBase.colorbar</span> has been removed in favor of its synonym *ticks* (which already existed previously, and is consistent with `matplotlib.colorbar`).
  - The *switch\_backend\_warn* parameter to `matplotlib.test` has no effect and has been removed.
  - The *dryrun* parameter to the various `FigureCanvas*.print_*` methods has been removed.

## rcParams

  - Setting `boxplot.whiskers` to `"range"` is no longer valid; set it to `0, 100` instead.
  - Setting `savefig.format` to `"auto"` is no longer valid; use `"png"` instead.
  - Setting `text.hinting` to <span class="title-ref">False</span> or <span class="title-ref">True</span> is no longer valid; set it to `"auto"` or `"none"` respectively.

## sample\_data removals

The sample datasets listed below have been removed. Suggested replacements for demonstration purposes are listed in parentheses.

  - `None_vs_nearest-pdf.png`,
  - `aapl.npz` (use `goog.npz`),
  - `ada.png`, `grace_hopper.png` (use `grace_hopper.jpg`),
  - `ct.raw.gz` (use `s1045.ima.gz`),
  - `damodata.csv` (use `msft.csv`).

# API Changes for 3.4.2

## Behaviour changes

### Rename first argument to `subplot_mosaic`

Both <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> have had the first position argument renamed from *layout* to *mosaic*. This is because we are considering to consolidate *constrained\_layout* and *tight\_layout* keyword arguments in the Figure creation functions of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot</span> into a single *layout* keyword argument which would collide.

As this API is provisional, we are changing this with no deprecation period.

# Behaviour changes

## First argument to `subplot_mosaic` renamed

Both <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> have had the first positional argument renamed from *layout* to *mosaic*. As we have consolidated the *constrained\_layout* and *tight\_layout* keyword arguments in the Figure creation functions of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot</span> into a single *layout* keyword argument, the original `subplot_mosaic` argument name would collide.

As this API is provisional, we are changing this argument name with no deprecation period.

## `Axes` children are no longer separated by type

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes</span> children were separated by <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> type, into sublists such as `Axes.lines`. For methods that produced multiple elements (such as <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span>), though individual parts would have similar *zorder*, this separation might cause them to be drawn at different times, causing inconsistent results when overlapping other Artists.

Now, the children are no longer separated by type, and the sublist properties are generated dynamically when accessed. Consequently, Artists will now always appear in the correct sublist; e.g., if <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.add\_line</span> is called on a <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span>, it will appear in the `Axes.patches` sublist, *not* `Axes.lines`. The `Axes.add_*` methods will now warn if passed an unexpected type.

Modification of the following sublists is still accepted, but deprecated:

  - `Axes.artists`
  - `Axes.collections`
  - `Axes.images`
  - `Axes.lines`
  - `Axes.patches`
  - `Axes.tables`
  - `Axes.texts`

To remove an Artist, use its <span class="title-ref">.Artist.remove</span> method. To add an Artist, use the corresponding `Axes.add_*` method.

## `MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` now subclasses `DeprecationWarning`

Historically, it has not been possible to filter <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span>s by checking for <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span>, since we subclass <span class="title-ref">UserWarning</span> directly.

The decision to not subclass <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span> has to do with a decision from core Python in the 2.x days to not show <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span>s to users. However, there is now a more sophisticated filter in place (see <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0565/>).

Users will now see <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span> only during interactive sessions, and these can be silenced by the standard mechanism:

``` python
warnings.filterwarnings("ignore", category=DeprecationWarning)
```

Library authors must now enable <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span>s explicitly in order for (non-interactive) CI/CD pipelines to report back these warnings, as is standard for the rest of the Python ecosystem:

``` python
warnings.filterwarnings("always", DeprecationWarning)
```

## `Artist.set` applies artist properties in the order in which they are given

The change only affects the interaction between the *color*, *edgecolor*, *facecolor*, and (for <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>s) *alpha* properties: the *color* property now needs to be passed first in order not to override the other properties. This is consistent with e.g. <span class="title-ref">.Artist.update</span>, which did not reorder the properties passed to it.

## `pcolor(mesh)` shading defaults to auto

The *shading* keyword argument for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolormesh</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolor</span> default has been changed to 'auto'.

Passing `Z(M, N)`, `x(N)`, `y(M)` to `pcolormesh` with `shading='flat'` will now raise a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span>. Use `shading='auto'` or `shading='nearest'` for `x` and `y` to be treated as cell centers, or drop the last column and row of `Z` to get the old behaviour with `shading='flat'`.

## Colorbars now have pan and zoom functionality

Interactive plots with colorbars can now be zoomed and panned on the colorbar axis. This adjusts the *vmin* and *vmax* of the <span class="title-ref">.ScalarMappable</span> associated with the colorbar. This is currently only enabled for continuous norms. Norms used with `contourf` and categoricals, such as <span class="title-ref">.BoundaryNorm</span> and <span class="title-ref">.NoNorm</span>, have the interactive capability disabled by default. <span class="title-ref">cb.ax.set\_navigate() \<.Axes.set\_navigate\></span> can be used to set whether a colorbar axes is interactive or not.

## Colorbar lines no longer clipped

If a colorbar has lines added to it (e.g. for contour lines), these will no longer be clipped. This is an improvement for lines on the edge of the colorbar, but could lead to lines off the colorbar if the limits of the colorbar are changed.

## `Figure.suppressComposite` now also controls compositing of Axes images

## The output of `NonUniformImage` and `PcolorImage` has changed

Pixel-level differences may be observed in images generated using <span class="title-ref">.NonUniformImage</span> or <span class="title-ref">.PcolorImage</span>, typically for pixels exactly at the boundary between two data cells (no user-facing axes method currently generates <span class="title-ref">.NonUniformImage</span>s, and only <span class="title-ref">.pcolorfast</span> can generate <span class="title-ref">.PcolorImage</span>s). These artists are also now slower, normally by \~1.5x but sometimes more (in particular for `NonUniformImage(interpolation="bilinear")`. This slowdown arises from fixing occasional floating point inaccuracies.

## Change of the (default) legend handler for `Line2D` instances

The default legend handler for Line2D instances (<span class="title-ref">.HandlerLine2D</span>) now consistently exposes all the attributes and methods related to the line marker (`11358`). This makes it easy to change the marker features after instantiating a legend.

`` `python     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      fig, ax = plt.subplots()      ax.plot([1, 3, 2], marker="s", label="Line", color="pink", mec="red", ms=8)     leg = ax.legend()      leg.legendHandles[0].set_color("lightgray")     leg.legendHandles[0].set_mec("black")  # marker edge color  The former legend handler for Line2D objects has been renamed ``<span class="title-ref"> </span>.HandlerLine2DCompound\`. To revert to the previous behaviour, one can use

`` `python     import matplotlib.legend as mlegend     from matplotlib.legend_handler import HandlerLine2DCompound     from matplotlib.lines import Line2D      mlegend.Legend.update_default_handler_map({Line2D: HandlerLine2DCompound()})  Setting ``Line2D`marker edge/face color to *None* use rcParams`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

`Line2D.set_markeredgecolor(None)` and `Line2D.set_markerfacecolor(None)` now set the line property using the corresponding rcParam (`lines.markeredgecolor` and `lines.markerfacecolor`). This is consistent with other <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> property setters.

## Default theta tick locations for wedge polar plots have changed

For polar plots that don't cover a full circle, the default theta tick locations are now at multiples of 10°, 15°, 30°, 45°, 90°, rather than using values that mostly make sense for linear plots (20°, 25°, etc.).

## `axvspan` now plots full wedges in polar plots

... rather than triangles.

## Convenience converter from `Scale` to `Normalize` now public

Downstream libraries can take advantage of <span class="title-ref">.colors.make\_norm\_from\_scale</span> to create a <span class="title-ref">\~.colors.Normalize</span> subclass directly from an existing scale. Usually norms have a scale, and the advantage of having a <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.ScaleBase</span> attached to a norm is to provide a scale, and associated tick locators and formatters, for the colorbar.

## `ContourSet` always use `PathCollection`

In order to correct rendering issues with closed loops, the <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> now creates a <span class="title-ref">.PathCollection</span> instead of a <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span> for line contours. This type matches the artist used for filled contours.

This affects <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> itself and its subclasses, <span class="title-ref">.QuadContourSet</span> (returned by <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contour</span>), and <span class="title-ref">.TriContourSet</span> (returned by <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tricontour</span>).

## `hatch.SmallFilledCircles` inherits from `hatch.Circles`

The <span class="title-ref">.hatch.SmallFilledCircles</span> class now inherits from <span class="title-ref">.hatch.Circles</span> rather than from <span class="title-ref">.hatch.SmallCircles</span>.

## hexbin with a log norm

<span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.hexbin</span> no longer (incorrectly) adds 1 to every bin value if a log norm is being used.

## Setting invalid `rcParams["date.converter"]` now raises ValueError

Previously, invalid values passed to `date.converter` would be ignored with a <span class="title-ref">UserWarning</span>, but now raise <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

## `Text` and `TextBox` added *parse\_math* option

<span class="title-ref">.Text</span> and <span class="title-ref">.TextBox</span> objects now allow a *parse\_math* keyword-only argument which controls whether math should be parsed from the displayed string. If *True*, the string will be parsed as a math text object. If *False*, the string will be considered a literal and no parsing will occur.

For <span class="title-ref">.Text</span>, this argument defaults to *True*. For <span class="title-ref">.TextBox</span> this argument defaults to *False*.

## `Type1Font` objects now decrypt the encrypted part

Type 1 fonts have a large part of their code encrypted as an obsolete copy-protection measure. This part is now available decrypted as the `decrypted` attribute of `matplotlib.type1font.Type1Font`. This decrypted data is not yet parsed, but this is a prerequisite for implementing subsetting.

## 3D contourf polygons placed between levels

The polygons used in a 3D <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.contourf</span> plot are now placed halfway between the contour levels, as each polygon represents the location of values that lie between two levels.

## `AxesDivider` now defaults to rcParams-specified pads

<span class="title-ref">.AxesDivider.append\_axes</span>, `AxesDivider.new_horizontal`, and `AxesDivider.new_vertical` now default to paddings specified by `figure.subplot.wspace` and `figure.subplot.hspace` rather than zero.

# Deprecations

## Discouraged: `Figure` parameters *tight\_layout* and *constrained\_layout*

The `Figure` parameters *tight\_layout* and *constrained\_layout* are triggering competing layout mechanisms and thus should not be used together.

To make the API clearer, we've merged them under the new parameter *layout* with values 'constrained' (equal to `constrained_layout=True`), 'tight' (equal to `tight_layout=True`). If given, *layout* takes precedence.

The use of *tight\_layout* and *constrained\_layout* is discouraged in favor of *layout*. However, these parameters will stay available for backward compatibility.

## Modification of `Axes` children sublists

See \[Behavioural API Changes 3.5 - Axes children combined\](\#behavioural-api-changes-3.5---axes-children-combined) for more information; modification of the following sublists is deprecated:

  - `Axes.artists`
  - `Axes.collections`
  - `Axes.images`
  - `Axes.lines`
  - `Axes.patches`
  - `Axes.tables`
  - `Axes.texts`

To remove an Artist, use its <span class="title-ref">.Artist.remove</span> method. To add an Artist, use the corresponding `Axes.add_*` method.

## Passing incorrect types to `Axes.add_*` methods

The following `Axes.add_*` methods will now warn if passed an unexpected type. See their documentation for the types they expect.

  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_collection</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_image</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_line</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_patch</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_table</span>

## Discouraged: `plot_date`

The use of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot\_date</span> is discouraged. This method exists for historic reasons and may be deprecated in the future.

  - `datetime`-like data should directly be plotted using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span>.
  - If you need to plot plain numeric data as \[date-format\](\#date-format) or need to set a timezone, call `ax.xaxis.axis_date` / `ax.yaxis.axis_date` before <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span>. See <span class="title-ref">.Axis.axis\_date</span>.

## `epoch2num` and `num2epoch` are deprecated

These methods convert from unix timestamps to matplotlib floats, but are not used internally to matplotlib, and should not be needed by end users. To convert a unix timestamp to datetime, simply use <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime.utcfromtimestamp</span>, or to use NumPy <span class="title-ref">\~numpy.datetime64</span> `dt = np.datetime64(e*1e6, 'us')`.

## Auto-removal of grids by <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span>

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> currently remove any visible axes major grid. This behavior is deprecated; please explicitly call `ax.grid(False)` to remove the grid.

## The first parameter of `Axes.grid` and `Axis.grid` has been renamed to *visible*

The parameter was previously named *b*. This deprecation only matters if that parameter was passed using a keyword argument, e.g. `grid(b=False)`.

## Unification and cleanup of Selector widget API

The API for Selector widgets has been unified to use:

  - *props* for the properties of the Artist representing the selection.
  - *handle\_props* for the Artists representing handles for modifying the selection.
  - *grab\_range* for the maximal tolerance to grab a handle with the mouse.

Additionally, several internal parameters and attribute have been deprecated with the intention of keeping them private.

### RectangleSelector and EllipseSelector

The *drawtype* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> is deprecated. In the future the only behaviour will be the default behaviour of `drawtype='box'`.

Support for `drawtype=line` will be removed altogether as it is not clear which points are within and outside a selector that is just a line. As a result, the *lineprops* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> is also deprecated.

To retain the behaviour of `drawtype='none'`, use `rectprops={'visible': False}` to make the drawn <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle</span> invisible.

Cleaned up attributes and arguments are:

  - The `active_handle` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `drawtype` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `eventpress` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `eventrelease` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `interactive` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The *marker\_props* argument is deprecated, use *handle\_props* instead.
  - The *maxdist* argument is deprecated, use *grab\_range* instead.
  - The *rectprops* argument is deprecated, use *props* instead.
  - The `rectprops` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `state` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `to_draw` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.

### PolygonSelector

  - The *line* attribute is deprecated. If you want to change the selector artist properties, use the `set_props` or `set_handle_props` methods.
  - The *lineprops* argument is deprecated, use *props* instead.
  - The *markerprops* argument is deprecated, use *handle\_props* instead.
  - The *maxdist* argument and attribute is deprecated, use *grab\_range* instead.
  - The *vertex\_select\_radius* argument and attribute is deprecated, use *grab\_range* instead.

### SpanSelector

  - The `active_handle` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `eventpress` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `eventrelease` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The *maxdist* argument and attribute is deprecated, use *grab\_range* instead.
  - The `pressv` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `prev` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `rect` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The *rectprops* argument is deprecated, use *props* instead.
  - The `rectprops` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The *span\_stays* argument is deprecated, use the *interactive* argument instead.
  - The `span_stays` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.
  - The `state` attribute has been privatized and deprecated.

### LassoSelector

  - The *lineprops* argument is deprecated, use *props* instead.
  - The `onpress` and `onrelease` methods are deprecated. They are straight aliases for `press` and `release`.

## `ConversionInterface.convert` no longer needs to accept unitless values

Previously, custom subclasses of <span class="title-ref">.units.ConversionInterface</span> needed to implement a `convert` method that not only accepted instances of the unit, but also unitless values (which are passed through as is). This is no longer the case (`convert` is never called with a unitless value), and such support in <span class="title-ref">.StrCategoryConverter</span> is deprecated. Likewise, the `.ConversionInterface.is_numlike` helper is deprecated.

Consider calling <span class="title-ref">.Axis.convert\_units</span> instead, which still supports unitless values.

## Locator and Formatter wrapper methods

The `set_view_interval`, `set_data_interval` and `set_bounds` methods of <span class="title-ref">.Locator</span>s and <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span>s (and their common base class, TickHelper) are deprecated. Directly manipulate the view and data intervals on the underlying axis instead.

## Unused positional parameters to `print_<fmt>` methods

None of the `print_<fmt>` methods implemented by canvas subclasses used positional arguments other that the first (the output filename or file-like), so these extra parameters are deprecated.

## `QuadMesh` signature

The <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh</span> signature :

    def __init__(meshWidth, meshHeight, coordinates,
                 antialiased=True, shading='flat', **kwargs)

is deprecated and replaced by the new signature :

    def __init__(coordinates, *, antialiased=True, shading='flat', **kwargs)

In particular:

  - The *coordinates* argument must now be a (M, N, 2) array-like. Previously, the grid shape was separately specified as (*meshHeight* + 1, *meshWidth* +
    
    1\) and *coordinates* could be an array-like of any shape with M \* N \* 2 elements.

  - All parameters except *coordinates* are keyword-only now.

## rcParams will no longer cast inputs to str

After a deprecation period, rcParams that expect a (non-pathlike) str will no longer cast non-str inputs using <span class="title-ref">str</span>. This will avoid confusing errors in subsequent code if e.g. a list input gets implicitly cast to a str.

## Case-insensitive scales

Previously, scales could be set case-insensitively (e.g., `set_xscale("LoG")`). This is deprecated; all builtin scales use lowercase names.

## Interactive cursor details

Setting a mouse cursor on a window has been moved from the toolbar to the canvas. Consequently, several implementation details on toolbars and within backends have been deprecated.

### `NavigationToolbar2.set_cursor` and `backend_tools.SetCursorBase.set_cursor`

Instead, use the <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase.set\_cursor</span> method on the canvas (available as the `canvas` attribute on the toolbar or the Figure.)

### `backend_tools.SetCursorBase` and subclasses

`backend_tools.SetCursorBase` was subclassed to provide backend-specific implementations of `set_cursor`. As that is now deprecated, the subclassing is no longer necessary. Consequently, the following subclasses are also deprecated:

  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk3.SetCursorGTK3`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.SetCursorQt`
  - `matplotlib.backends._backend_tk.SetCursorTk`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.SetCursorWx`

Instead, use the <span class="title-ref">.backend\_tools.ToolSetCursor</span> class.

### `cursord` in GTK, Qt, and wx backends

The `backend_gtk3.cursord`, `backend_qt.cursord`, and `backend_wx.cursord` dictionaries are deprecated. This makes the GTK module importable on headless environments.

## Miscellaneous deprecations

  - `is_url` and `URL_REGEX` are deprecated. (They were previously defined in the toplevel `matplotlib` module.)
  - The `ArrowStyle.beginarrow` and `ArrowStyle.endarrow` attributes are deprecated; use the `arrow` attribute to define the desired heads and tails of the arrow.
  - `backend_pgf.LatexManager.str_cache` is deprecated.
  - `backends.qt_compat.ETS` and `backends.qt_compat.QT_RC_MAJOR_VERSION` are deprecated, with no replacement.
  - The `blocking_input` module has been deprecated. Instead, use `canvas.start_event_loop()` and `canvas.stop_event_loop()` while connecting event callbacks as needed.
  - `cbook.report_memory` is deprecated; use `psutil.virtual_memory` instead.
  - `cm.LUTSIZE` is deprecated. Use `image.lut` instead. This value only affects colormap quantization levels for default colormaps generated at module import time.
  - `Collection.__init__` previously ignored *transOffset* without *offsets* also being specified. In the future, *transOffset* will begin having an effect regardless of *offsets*. In the meantime, if you wish to set *transOffset*, call <span class="title-ref">.Collection.set\_offset\_transform</span> explicitly.
  - `Colorbar.patch` is deprecated; this attribute is not correctly updated anymore.
  - `ContourLabeler.get_label_width` is deprecated.
  - `dviread.PsfontsMap` now raises LookupError instead of KeyError for missing fonts.
  - `Dvi.baseline` is deprecated (with no replacement).
  - The *format* parameter of `dviread.find_tex_file` is deprecated (with no replacement).
  - `FancyArrowPatch.get_path_in_displaycoord` and `ConnectionPath.get_path_in_displaycoord` are deprecated. The path in display coordinates can still be obtained, as for other patches, using `patch.get_transform().transform_path(patch.get_path())`.
  - The `font_manager.win32InstalledFonts` and `font_manager.get_fontconfig_fonts` helper functions have been deprecated.
  - All parameters of `imshow` starting from *aspect* will become keyword-only.
  - `QuadMesh.convert_mesh_to_paths` and `QuadMesh.convert_mesh_to_triangles` are deprecated. `QuadMesh.get_paths()` can be used as an alternative for the former; there is no replacement for the latter.
  - `ScalarMappable.callbacksSM` is deprecated. Use `ScalarMappable.callbacks` instead.
  - `streamplot.get_integrator` is deprecated.
  - `style.core.STYLE_FILE_PATTERN`, `style.core.load_base_library`, and `style.core.iter_user_libraries` are deprecated.
  - `SubplotParams.validate` is deprecated. Use <span class="title-ref">.SubplotParams.update</span> to change <span class="title-ref">.SubplotParams</span> while always keeping it in a valid state.
  - The `grey_arrayd`, `font_family`, `font_families`, and `font_info` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.TexManager</span> are deprecated.
  - `Text.get_prop_tup` is deprecated with no replacements (because the <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> class cannot know whether a backend needs to update cache e.g. when the text's color changes).
  - `Tick.apply_tickdir` didn't actually update the tick markers on the existing Line2D objects used to draw the ticks and is deprecated; use <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span> instead.
  - `tight_layout.auto_adjust_subplotpars` is deprecated.
  - The `grid_info` attribute of `axisartist` classes has been deprecated.
  - `axisartist.clip_path` is deprecated with no replacement.
  - `axes_grid1.axes_grid.CbarAxes` and `axes_grid1.axisartist.CbarAxes` are deprecated (they are now dynamically generated based on the owning axes class).
  - The `axes_grid1.Divider.get_vsize_hsize` and `axes_grid1.Grid.get_vsize_hsize` methods are deprecated. Copy their implementations if needed.
  - `AxesDivider.append_axes(..., add_to_figure=False)` is deprecated. Use `ax.remove()` to remove the Axes from the figure if needed.
  - `FixedAxisArtistHelper.change_tick_coord` is deprecated with no replacement.
  - `floating_axes.GridHelperCurveLinear.get_boundary` is deprecated, with no replacement.
  - `ParasiteAxesBase.get_images_artists` has been deprecated.
  - The "units finalize" signal (previously emitted by Axis instances) is deprecated. Connect to "units" instead.
  - Passing formatting parameters positionally to `stem()` is deprecated

## `plot_directive` deprecations

The `:encoding:` option to `.. plot` directive has had no effect since Matplotlib 1.3.1, and is now deprecated.

The following helpers in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sphinxext.plot\_directive</span> are deprecated:

  - `unescape_doctest` (use <span class="title-ref">doctest.script\_from\_examples</span> instead),
  - `split_code_at_show`,
  - `run_code`.

## Testing support

### `matplotlib.test()` is deprecated

Run tests using `pytest` from the commandline instead. The variable `matplotlib.default_test_modules` is only used for `matplotlib.test()` and is thus deprecated as well.

To test an installed copy, be sure to specify both `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits` with `--pyargs`:

    pytest --pyargs matplotlib.tests mpl_toolkits.tests

See \[testing\](\#testing) for more details.

### Unused pytest fixtures and markers

The fixture `matplotlib.testing.conftest.mpl_image_comparison_parameters` is not used internally by Matplotlib. If you use this please copy it into your code base.

The `@pytest.mark.style` marker is deprecated; use `@mpl.style.context`, which has the same effect.

## Support for `nx1 = None` or `ny1 = None` in `AxesLocator` and `Divider.locate`

In <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider</span>, various internal APIs will stop supporting passing `nx1 = None` or `ny1 = None` to mean `nx + 1` or `ny + 1`, in preparation for a possible future API which allows indexing and slicing of dividers (possibly `divider[a:b] == divider.new_locator(a, b)`, but also `divider[a:] == divider.new_locator(a, <end>)`). The user-facing <span class="title-ref">.Divider.new\_locator</span> API is unaffected -- it correctly normalizes `nx1 = None` and `ny1 = None` as needed.

# Development changes

## Increase to minimum supported versions of dependencies

For Matplotlib 3.5, the \[minimum supported versions \<dependencies\>\](\#minimum-supported-versions-\<dependencies\>) and some \[optional dependencies \<optional\_dependencies\>\](\#optional-dependencies-\<optional\_dependencies\>) are being bumped:

<table style="width:67%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 22%" />
<col style="width: 22%" />
<col style="width: 22%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Dependency</th>
<th>min in mpl3.4</th>
<th>min in mpl3.5</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>NumPy</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>1.16</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>1.17</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>Tk (optional)</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>8.3</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>8.4</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy) and [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

## New wheel architectures

Wheels have been added for:

  - Python 3.10
  - PyPy 3.7
  - macOS on Apple Silicon (both arm64 and universal2)

## New build dependencies

Versioning has been switched from bundled versioneer to [setuptools-scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm/) using the `release-branch-semver` version scheme. The latter is well-maintained, but may require slight modification to packaging scripts.

The [setuptools-scm-git-archive](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm-git-archive/) plugin is also used for consistent version export.

## Data directory is no longer optional

Historically, the `mpl-data` directory has been optional (example files were unnecessary, and fonts could be deleted if a suitable dependency on a system font were provided). Though example files are still optional, they have been substantially pared down, and we now consider the directory to be required.

Specifically, the `matplotlibrc` file found there is used for runtime verifications and must exist. Packagers may still symlink fonts to system versions if needed.

## New runtime dependencies

### fontTools for type 42 subsetting

A new dependency [fontTools](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/) is integrated into Matplotlib 3.5. It is designed to be used with PS/EPS and PDF documents; and handles Type 42 font subsetting.

### Underscore support in LaTeX

The [underscore](https://ctan.org/pkg/underscore) package is now a requirement to improve support for underscores in LaTeX.

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy).

## Matplotlib-specific build options moved from `setup.cfg` to `mplsetup.cfg`

In order to avoid conflicting with the use of `setup.cfg` by `setuptools`, the Matplotlib-specific build options have moved from `setup.cfg` to `mplsetup.cfg`. The `setup.cfg.template` has been correspondingly been renamed to `mplsetup.cfg.template`.

Note that the path to this configuration file can still be set via the `MPLSETUPCFG` environment variable, which allows one to keep using the same file before and after this change.

# Removals

The following deprecated APIs have been removed:

## Removed behaviour

### Stricter validation of function parameters

  - Calling <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_axes</span> with no arguments will raise an error. Adding a free-floating axes needs a position rectangle. If you want a figure-filling single axes, use <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_subplot</span> instead.

  - <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_subplot</span> validates its inputs; in particular, for `add_subplot(rows, cols, index)`, all parameters must be integral. Previously strings and floats were accepted and converted to int.

  - Passing *None* as the *which* argument to `autofmt_xdate` is no longer supported; use its more explicit synonym, `which="major"`, instead.

  - Setting the *orientation* of an `eventplot()` or <span class="title-ref">.EventCollection</span> to "none" or *None* is no longer supported; set it to "horizontal" instead. Moreover, the two orientations ("horizontal" and "vertical") are now case-sensitive.

  - Passing parameters *norm* and *vmin*/*vmax* simultaneously to functions using colormapping such as `scatter()` and `imshow()` is no longer supported. Instead of `norm=LogNorm(), vmin=min_val, vmax=max_val` pass `norm=LogNorm(min_val, max_val)`. *vmin* and *vmax* should only be used without setting *norm*.

  - Passing *None* as either the *radius* or *startangle* arguments of an <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span> is no longer accepted; use the explicit defaults of 1 and 0, respectively, instead.

  - Passing *None* as the *normalize* argument of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span> (the former default) is no longer accepted, and the pie will always be normalized by default. If you wish to plot an incomplete pie, explicitly pass `normalize=False`.

  - Support for passing *None* to `subplot_class_factory` has been removed. Explicitly pass in the base <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> class instead.

  - Passing multiple keys as a single comma-separated string or multiple arguments to <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager.update\_keymap</span> is no longer supported; pass keys as a list of strings instead.

  - Passing the dash offset as *None* is no longer accepted, as this was never universally implemented, e.g. for vector output. Set the offset to 0 instead.

  - Setting a custom method overriding <span class="title-ref">.Artist.contains</span> using `Artist.set_contains` has been removed, as has `Artist.get_contains`. There is no replacement, but you may still customize pick events using <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_picker</span>.

  - <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.semilogx</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.semilogy</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.loglog</span>, <span class="title-ref">.LogScale</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.SymmetricalLogScale</span> used to take keyword arguments that depends on the axis orientation ("basex" vs "basey", "subsx" vs "subsy", "nonposx" vs "nonposy"); these parameter names have been removed in favor of "base", "subs", "nonpositive". This removal also affects e.g. `ax.set_yscale("log", basey=...)` which must now be spelled `ax.set_yscale("log", base=...)`.
    
    The change from "nonpos" to "nonpositive" also affects <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.LogTransform</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.InvertedLogTransform</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.SymmetricalLogTransform</span>, etc.
    
    To use *different* bases for the x-axis and y-axis of a <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.loglog</span> plot, use e.g. `ax.set_xscale("log", base=10); ax.set_yscale("log", base=2)`.

  - Passing *None*, or no argument, to `parasite_axes_class_factory`, `parasite_axes_auxtrans_class_factory`, `host_axes_class_factory` is no longer accepted; pass an explicit base class instead.

### Case-sensitivity is now enforced more

  - Upper or mixed-case property names are no longer normalized to lowercase in <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Artist.update</span>. This allows one to pass names such as *patchA* or *UVC*.
  - Case-insensitive capstyles and joinstyles are no longer lower-cased; please pass capstyles ("miter", "round", "bevel") and joinstyles ("butt", "round", "projecting") as lowercase.
  - Saving metadata in PDF with the PGF backend no longer changes keys to lowercase. Only the canonically cased keys listed in the PDF specification (and the <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span> documentation) are accepted.

### No implicit initialization of `Tick` attributes

The <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span> constructor no longer initializes the attributes `tick1line`, `tick2line`, `gridline`, `label1`, and `label2` via `_get_tick1line`, `_get_tick2line`, `_get_gridline`, `_get_text1`, and `_get_text2`. Please directly set the attribute in the subclass' `__init__` instead.

### `NavigationToolbar2` subclass changes

Overriding the `_init_toolbar` method of <span class="title-ref">.NavigationToolbar2</span> to initialize third-party toolbars is no longer supported. Instead, the toolbar should be initialized in the `__init__` method of the subclass (which should call the base-class' `__init__` as appropriate).

The `press` and `release` methods of <span class="title-ref">.NavigationToolbar2</span> were called when pressing or releasing a mouse button, but *only* when an interactive pan or zoom was occurring (contrary to what the docs stated). They are no longer called; if you write a backend which needs to customize such events, please directly override `press_pan`/`press_zoom`/`release_pan`/`release_zoom` instead.

### Removal of old file mode flag

Flags containing "U" passed to <span class="title-ref">.cbook.to\_filehandle</span> and <span class="title-ref">.cbook.open\_file\_cm</span> are no longer accepted. This is consistent with their removal from <span class="title-ref">open</span> in Python 3.9.

### Keymaps toggling `Axes.get_navigate` have been removed

This includes numeric key events and rcParams.

### The `TTFPATH` and `AFMPATH` environment variables

Support for the (undocumented) `TTFPATH` and `AFMPATH` environment variables has been removed. Register additional fonts using `matplotlib.font_manager.fontManager.addfont()`.

## Modules

  - `matplotlib.backends.qt_editor.formsubplottool`; use `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt.SubplotToolQt` instead.
  - `matplotlib.compat`
  - `matplotlib.ttconv`
  - The Qt4-based backends, `qt4agg` and `qt4cairo`, have been removed. Qt4 has reached its end-of-life in 2015 and there are no releases of either PyQt4 or PySide for recent versions of Python. Please use one of the Qt5 or Qt6 backends.

## Classes, methods and attributes

The following module-level classes/variables have been removed:

  - `backend_bases.StatusbarBase` and all its subclasses, and `StatusBarWx`; messages are displayed in the toolbar
  - `backend_pgf.GraphicsContextPgf`
  - `MODIFIER_KEYS`, `SUPER`, `ALT`, `CTRL`, and `SHIFT` of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.backend\_qt5agg</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.backend\_qt5cairo</span>
  - `backend_wx.DEBUG_MSG`
  - `dviread.Encoding`
  - `Fil`, `Fill`, `Filll`, `NegFil`, `NegFill`, `NegFilll`, and `SsGlue` from <span class="title-ref">.mathtext</span>; directly construct glue instances with `Glue("fil")`, etc.
  - `mathtext.GlueSpec`
  - `OldScalarFormatter`, `IndexFormatter` and `IndexDateFormatter`; use <span class="title-ref">.FuncFormatter</span> instead
  - `OldAutoLocator`
  - `AVConvBase`, `AVConvWriter` and `AVConvFileWriter`. Debian 8 (2015, EOL 06/2020) and Ubuntu 14.04 (EOL 04/2019) were the last versions of Debian and Ubuntu to ship avconv. It remains possible to force the use of avconv by using the FFmpeg-based writers with `animation.ffmpeg_path` set to "avconv".
  - `matplotlib.axes._subplots._subplot_classes`
  - `axes_grid1.axes_rgb.RGBAxesBase`; use `RGBAxes` instead

The following class attributes have been removed:

  - `backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex_stdin_utf8`
  - `backend_pgf.PdfPages.metadata`
  - `ContourSet.ax` and `Quiver.ax`; use `ContourSet.axes` or `Quiver.axes` as with other artists
  - `DateFormatter.illegal_s`
  - `dates.YearLocator.replaced`; <span class="title-ref">.YearLocator</span> is now a subclass of <span class="title-ref">.RRuleLocator</span>, and the attribute `YearLocator.replaced` has been removed. For tick locations that required modifying this, a custom rrule and <span class="title-ref">.RRuleLocator</span> can be used instead.
  - `FigureManagerBase.statusbar`; messages are displayed in the toolbar
  - `FileMovieWriter.clear_temp`
  - `mathtext.Glue.glue_subtype`
  - `MovieWriter.args_key`, `MovieWriter.exec_key`, and `HTMLWriter.args_key`
  - `NavigationToolbar2QT.basedir`; the base directory to the icons is `os.path.join(mpl.get_data_path(), "images")`
  - `NavigationToolbar2QT.ctx`
  - `NavigationToolbar2QT.parent`; to access the parent window, use `toolbar.canvas.parent()` or `toolbar.parent()`
  - `prevZoomRect`, `retinaFix`, `savedRetinaImage`, `wxoverlay`, `zoomAxes`, `zoomStartX`, and `zoomStartY` attributes of `NavigationToolbar2Wx`
  - `NonUniformImage.is_grayscale`, `PcolorImage.is_grayscale`, for consistency with `AxesImage.is_grayscale`. (Note that previously, these attributes were only available *after rendering the image*).
  - `RendererCairo.fontweights`, `RendererCairo.fontangles`
  - `used_characters` of <span class="title-ref">.RendererPdf</span>, <span class="title-ref">.PdfFile</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.RendererPS</span>
  - `LogScale.LogTransform`, `LogScale.InvertedLogTransform`, `SymmetricalScale.SymmetricalTransform`, and `SymmetricalScale.InvertedSymmetricalTransform`; directly access the transform classes from <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.scale</span>
  - `cachedir`, `rgba_arrayd`, `serif`, `sans_serif`, `cursive`, and `monospace` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.TexManager</span>
  - `axleft`, `axright`, `axbottom`, `axtop`, `axwspace`, and `axhspace` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SubplotTool</span>; access the `ax` attribute of the corresponding slider
  - `widgets.TextBox.params_to_disable`
  - `angle_helper.LocatorBase.den`; it has been renamed to *nbins*
  - `axes_grid.CbarAxesBase.cbid` and `axes_grid.CbarAxesBase.locator`; use `mappable.colorbar_cid` or `colorbar.locator` instead

The following class methods have been removed:

  - `Axes.update_datalim_bounds`; use `ax.dataLim.set(Bbox.union([ax.dataLim, bounds]))`
  - `pan` and `zoom` methods of <span class="title-ref">\~.axis.Axis</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.Locator</span> have been removed; panning and zooming are now implemented using the `start_pan`, `drag_pan`, and `end_pan` methods of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span>
  - `.BboxBase.inverse_transformed`; call <span class="title-ref">.BboxBase.transformed</span> on the <span class="title-ref">\~.Transform.inverted()</span> transform
  - `Collection.set_offset_position` and `Collection.get_offset_position` have been removed; the `offset_position` of the <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> class is now "screen"
  - `Colorbar.on_mappable_changed` and `Colorbar.update_bruteforce`; use `Colorbar.update_normal()` instead
  - `docstring.Substitution.from_params` has been removed; directly assign to `params` of `docstring.Substitution` instead
  - `DraggableBase.artist_picker`; set the artist's picker instead
  - `DraggableBase.on_motion_blit`; use <span class="title-ref">.DraggableBase.on\_motion</span> instead
  - `FigureCanvasGTK3._renderer_init`
  - `Locator.refresh()` and the associated helper methods `NavigationToolbar2.draw()` and `ToolViewsPositions.refresh_locators()`
  - `track_characters` and `merge_used_characters` of <span class="title-ref">.RendererPdf</span>, <span class="title-ref">.PdfFile</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.RendererPS</span>
  - `RendererWx.get_gc`
  - `SubplotSpec.get_rows_columns`; use the `GridSpec.nrows`, `GridSpec.ncols`, `SubplotSpec.rowspan`, and `SubplotSpec.colspan` properties instead.
  - `ScalarMappable.update_dict`, `ScalarMappable.add_checker()`, and `ScalarMappable.check_update()`; register a callback in `ScalarMappable.callbacks` to be notified of updates
  - `TexManager.make_tex_preview` and `TexManager.make_dvi_preview`
  - `funcleft`, `funcright`, `funcbottom`, `functop`, `funcwspace`, and `funchspace` methods of <span class="title-ref">.widgets.SubplotTool</span>
  - `axes_grid1.axes_rgb.RGBAxes.add_RGB_to_figure`
  - `axisartist.axis_artist.AxisArtist.dpi_transform`
  - `axisartist.grid_finder.MaxNLocator.set_factor` and `axisartist.grid_finder.FixedLocator.set_factor`; the factor is always 1 now

## Functions

  - `bezier.make_path_regular` has been removed; use `Path.cleaned()` (or `Path.cleaned(curves=True)`, etc.) instead, but note that these methods add a `STOP` code at the end of the path.
  - `bezier.concatenate_paths` has been removed; use `Path.make_compound_path()` instead.
  - `cbook.local_over_kwdict` has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span> instead.
  - `qt_compat.is_pyqt5` has been removed due to the release of PyQt6. The Qt version can be checked using `QtCore.qVersion()`.
  - `testing.compare.make_external_conversion_command` has been removed.
  - `axes_grid1.axes_rgb.imshow_rgb` has been removed; use `imshow(np.dstack([r, g, b]))` instead.

## Arguments

  - The *s* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.annotate</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.annotate</span> is no longer supported; use the new name *text*.
  - The *inframe* parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span> has been removed; use <span class="title-ref">.Axes.redraw\_in\_frame</span> instead.
  - The *required*, *forbidden* and *allowed* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span> have been removed.
  - The *ismath* parameter of the `draw_tex` method of all renderer classes has been removed (as a call to `draw_tex` — not to be confused with `draw_text`\! — means that the entire string should be passed to the `usetex` machinery anyways). Likewise, the text machinery will no longer pass the *ismath* parameter when calling `draw_tex` (this should only matter for backend implementers).
  - The *quality*, *optimize*, and *progressive* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span> (which only affected JPEG output) have been removed, as well as from the corresponding `print_jpg` methods. JPEG output options can be set by directly passing the relevant parameters in *pil\_kwargs*.
  - The *clear\_temp* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.FileMovieWriter</span> has been removed; files placed in a temporary directory (using `frame_prefix=None`, the default) will be cleared; files placed elsewhere will not.
  - The *copy* parameter of `mathtext.Glue` has been removed.
  - The *quantize* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Path.cleaned()</span> has been removed.
  - The *dummy* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.RendererPgf</span> has been removed.
  - The *props* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Shadow</span> has been removed; use keyword arguments instead.
  - The *recursionlimit* parameter of `matplotlib.test` has been removed.
  - The *label* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span> has no effect and has been removed.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.MaxNLocator</span> no longer accepts a positional parameter and the keyword argument *nbins* simultaneously because they specify the same quantity.
  - The *add\_all* parameter to `axes_grid.Grid`, `axes_grid.ImageGrid`, `axes_rgb.make_rgb_axes`, and `axes_rgb.RGBAxes` have been removed; the APIs always behave as if `add_all=True`.
  - The *den* parameter of `axisartist.angle_helper.LocatorBase` has been removed; use *nbins* instead.
  - The *s* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">.AnnotationBbox.get\_fontsize</span> has no effect and has been removed.
  - The *offset\_position* keyword argument of the <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> class has been removed; the `offset_position` now "screen".
  - Arbitrary keyword arguments to `StreamplotSet` have no effect and have been removed.
  - The *fontdict* and *minor* parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xticklabels</span> / <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_yticklabels</span> are now keyword-only.
  - All parameters of <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplots</span> except *nrows* and *ncols* are now keyword-only; this avoids typing e.g. `subplots(1, 1, 1)` when meaning `subplot(1, 1, 1)`, but actually getting `subplots(1, 1, sharex=1)`.
  - All parameters of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.tight\_layout</span> are now keyword-only, to be consistent with <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span>.
  - `ColorbarBase` only takes a single positional argument now, the `Axes` to create it in, with all other options required to be keyword arguments. The warning for keyword arguments that were overridden by the mappable is now removed.
  - Omitting the *renderer* parameter to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span> is no longer supported; use `axes.draw_artist(axes)` instead.
  - Passing `ismath="TeX!"` to <span class="title-ref">.RendererAgg.get\_text\_width\_height\_descent</span> is no longer supported; pass `ismath="TeX"` instead,
  - Changes to the signature of the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.draw</span> method make it consistent with all other artists; thus additional parameters to <span class="title-ref">.Artist.draw</span> have also been removed.

## rcParams

  - The `animation.avconv_path` and `animation.avconv_args` rcParams have been removed.
  - The `animation.html_args` rcParam has been removed.
  - The `keymap.all_axes` rcParam has been removed.
  - The `mathtext.fallback_to_cm` rcParam has been removed. Use `mathtext.fallback` instead.
  - The `savefig.jpeg_quality` rcParam has been removed.
  - The `text.latex.preview` rcParam has been removed.
  - The following deprecated rcParams validators, defined in <span class="title-ref">.rcsetup</span>, have been removed:
      - `validate_alignment`
      - `validate_axes_titlelocation`
      - `validate_axis_locator`
      - `validate_bool_maybe_none`
      - `validate_fontset`
      - `validate_grid_axis`
      - `validate_hinting`
      - `validate_legend_loc`
      - `validate_mathtext_default`
      - `validate_movie_frame_fmt`
      - `validate_movie_html_fmt`
      - `validate_movie_writer`
      - `validate_nseq_float`
      - `validate_nseq_int`
      - `validate_orientation`
      - `validate_pgf_texsystem`
      - `validate_ps_papersize`
      - `validate_svg_fonttype`
      - `validate_toolbar`
      - `validate_webagg_address`
  - Some rcParam validation has become stricter:
      - `axes.axisbelow` no longer accepts strings starting with "line" (case-insensitive) as "line"; use "line" (case-sensitive) instead.
      - `text.latex.preamble` and `pdf.preamble` no longer accept non-string values.
      - All `*.linestyle` rcParams no longer accept `offset = None`; set the offset to 0 instead.

## QuadMesh mouseover defaults to False

New in 3.5, <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh.get\_cursor\_data</span> allows display of data values under the cursor. However, this can be very slow for large meshes, so by `.QuadMesh.set_mouseover` defaults to *False*.

## Passing *linefmt* positionally is undeprecated

Positional use of all formatting parameters in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> has been deprecated since Matplotlib 3.5. This deprecation is relaxed so that one can still pass *linefmt* positionally, i.e. `stem(x, y, 'r')`.

---

behaviour.md

---

# Behaviour changes

## `plt.get_cmap` and `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` return a copy

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.get\_cmap</span> and `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` returned a global version of a <span class="title-ref">.Colormap</span>. This was prone to errors as modification of the colormap would propagate from one location to another without warning. Now, a new copy of the colormap is returned.

## Large `imshow` images are now downsampled

When showing an image using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow</span> that has more than \(2^{24}\) columns or \(2^{23}\) rows, the image will now be downsampled to below this resolution before being resampled for display by the AGG renderer. Previously such a large image would be shown incorrectly. To prevent this downsampling and the warning it raises, manually downsample your data before handing it to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow</span>.

## Default date limits changed to 1970-01-01 – 1970-01-02

Previously the default limits for an empty axis set up for dates (<span class="title-ref">.Axis.axis\_date</span>) was 2000-01-01 to 2010-01-01. This has been changed to 1970-01-01 to 1970-01-02. With the default epoch, this makes the numeric limit for date axes the same as for other axes (0.0-1.0), and users are less likely to set a locator with far too many ticks.

## *markerfmt* argument to `stem`

The behavior of the *markerfmt* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> has changed:

  - If *markerfmt* does not contain a color, the color is taken from *linefmt*.
  - If *markerfmt* does not contain a marker, the default is 'o'.

Before, *markerfmt* was passed unmodified to `plot(..., fmt)`, which had a number of unintended side-effects; e.g. only giving a color switched to a solid line without markers.

For a simple call `stem(x, y)` without parameters, the new rules still reproduce the old behavior.

## `get_ticklabels` now always populates labels

Previously <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_ticklabels</span> (and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_xticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_yticklabels</span>) would only return empty strings unless a draw had already been performed. Now the ticks and their labels are updated when the labels are requested.

## Warning when scatter plot color settings discarded

When making an animation of a scatter plot, if you don't set *c* (the color value parameter) when initializing the artist, the color settings are ignored. <span class="title-ref">.Axes.scatter</span> now raises a warning if color-related settings are changed without setting *c*.

## 3D `contourf` polygons placed between levels

The polygons used in a 3D <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.contourf</span> plot are now placed halfway between the contour levels, as each polygon represents the location of values that lie between two levels.

## Axes title now avoids y-axis offset

Previously, Axes titles could overlap the y-axis offset text, which is often in the upper left corner of the axes. Now titles are moved above the offset text if overlapping when automatic title positioning is in effect (i.e. if *y* in <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_title</span> is *None* and `axes.titley` is also *None*).

## Dotted operators gain extra space in mathtext

In mathtext, `\doteq \doteqdot \dotminus \dotplus \dots` are now surrounded by extra space because they are correctly treated as relational or binary operators.

## *math* parameter of `mathtext.get_unicode_index` defaults to False

In math mode, ASCII hyphens (U+002D) are now replaced by Unicode minus signs (U+2212) at the parsing stage.

## `ArtistList` proxies copy contents on iteration

When iterating over the contents of the dynamically generated proxy lists for the Artist-type accessors (see \[Behavioural API Changes 3.5 - Axes children combined\](\#behavioural-api-changes-3.5---axes children-combined)), a copy of the contents is made. This ensure that artists can safely be added or removed from the Axes while iterating over their children.

This is a departure from the expected behavior of mutable iterable data types in Python — iterating over a list while mutating it has surprising consequences and dictionaries will error if they change size during iteration. Because all of the accessors are filtered views of the same underlying list, it is possible for seemingly unrelated changes, such as removing a Line, to affect the iteration over any of the other accessors. In this case, we have opted to make a copy of the relevant children before yielding them to the user.

This change is also consistent with our plan to make these accessors immutable in Matplotlib 3.7.

## `AxesImage` string representation

The string representation of <span class="title-ref">.AxesImage</span> changes from stating the position in the figure `"AxesImage(80,52.8;496x369.6)"` to giving the number of pixels `"AxesImage(size=(300, 200))"`.

## Improved autoscaling for Bézier curves

Bézier curves are now autoscaled to their extents - previously they were autoscaled to their ends and control points, which in some cases led to unnecessarily large limits.

## `QuadMesh` mouseover defaults to False

New in 3.5, <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh.get\_cursor\_data</span> allows display of data values under the cursor. However, this can be very slow for large meshes, so mouseover now defaults to *False*.

## Changed pgf backend document class

The pgf backend now uses the `article` document class as basis for compilation.

## `MathtextBackendAgg.get_results` no longer returns `used_characters`

The last item (`used_characters`) in the tuple returned by `MathtextBackendAgg.get_results` has been removed. In order to unpack this tuple in a backward and forward-compatible way, use e.g. `ox, oy, width, height, descent, image, *_ = parse(...)`, which will ignore `used_characters` if it was present.

## `Type1Font` objects include more properties

The `matplotlib._type1font.Type1Font.prop` dictionary now includes more keys, such as `CharStrings` and `Subrs`. The value of the `Encoding` key is now a dictionary mapping codes to glyph names. The `matplotlib._type1font.Type1Font.transform` method now correctly removes `UniqueID` properties from the font.

## `rcParams.copy()` returns `RcParams` rather than `dict`

Returning an <span class="title-ref">.RcParams</span> instance from <span class="title-ref">.RcParams.copy</span> makes the copy still validate inputs, and additionally avoids emitting deprecation warnings when using a previously copied instance to update the global instance (even if some entries are deprecated).

## `rc_context` no longer resets the value of `'backend'`

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.rc\_context</span> incorrectly reset the value of `backend` if backend resolution was triggered in the context. This affected only the value. The actual backend was not changed. Now, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.rc\_context</span> does not reset `backend` anymore.

## Default `rcParams["animation.convert_args"]` changed

It now defaults to `["-layers", "OptimizePlus"]` to try to generate smaller GIFs. Set it back to an empty list to recover the previous behavior.

## Style file encoding now specified to be UTF-8

It has been impossible to import Matplotlib with a non UTF-8 compatible locale encoding because we read the style library at import time. This change is formalizing and documenting the status quo so there is no deprecation period.

## MacOSX backend uses sRGB instead of GenericRGB color space

MacOSX backend now display sRGB tagged image instead of GenericRGB which is an older (now deprecated) Apple color space. This is the source color space used by ColorSync to convert to the current display profile.

## Renderer optional for `get_tightbbox` and `get_window_extent`

The <span class="title-ref">.Artist.get\_tightbbox</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Artist.get\_window\_extent</span> methods no longer require the *renderer* keyword argument, saving users from having to query it from `fig.canvas.get_renderer`. If the *renderer* keyword argument is not supplied, these methods first check if there is a cached renderer from a previous draw and use that. If there is no cached renderer, then the methods will use `fig.canvas.get_renderer()` as a fallback.

## `FigureFrameWx` constructor, subclasses, and `get_canvas`

The `FigureCanvasWx` constructor gained a *canvas\_class* keyword-only parameter which specifies the canvas class that should be used. This parameter will become required in the future. The `get_canvas` method, which was previously used to customize canvas creation, is deprecated. The `FigureFrameWxAgg` and `FigureFrameWxCairo` subclasses, which overrode `get_canvas`, are deprecated.

## `FigureFrameWx.sizer`

... has been removed. The frame layout is no longer based on a sizer, as the canvas is now the sole child widget; the toolbar is now a regular toolbar added using `SetToolBar`.

## Incompatible layout engines raise

You cannot switch between `tight_layout` and `constrained_layout` if a colorbar has already been added to a figure. Invoking the incompatible layout engine used to warn, but now raises with a <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span>.

## `CallbackRegistry` raises on unknown signals

When Matplotlib instantiates a <span class="title-ref">.CallbackRegistry</span>, it now limits callbacks to the signals that the registry knows about. In practice, this means that calling <span class="title-ref">\~.FigureCanvasBase.mpl\_connect</span> with an invalid signal name now raises a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

## Changed exception type for incorrect SVG date metadata

Providing date metadata with incorrect type to the SVG backend earlier resulted in a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>. Now, a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> is raised instead.

## Specified exception types in `Grid`

In a few cases an <span class="title-ref">Exception</span> was thrown when an incorrect argument value was set in the <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.Grid</span> (= `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_grid.Grid`) constructor. These are replaced as follows:

  - Providing an incorrect value for *ngrids* now raises a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>
  - Providing an incorrect type for *rect* now raises a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span>

# Deprecations

## Parameters to `plt.figure()` and the `Figure` constructor

All parameters to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.figure</span> and the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> constructor, other than *num*, *figsize*, and *dpi*, will become keyword-only after a deprecation period.

## Deprecation aliases in cbook

The module `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation` was previously deprecated in Matplotlib 3.4, along with deprecation-related API in `matplotlib.cbook`. Due to technical issues, `matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` and `matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation` did not raise deprecation warnings on use. Changes in Python have now made it possible to warn when these aliases are being used.

In order to avoid downstream breakage, these aliases will now warn, and their removal has been pushed from 3.6 to 3.8 to give time to notice said warnings. As replacement, please use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span>.

## `Axes` subclasses should override `clear` instead of `cla`

For clarity, <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.clear</span> is now preferred over <span class="title-ref">.Axes.cla</span>. However, for backwards compatibility, the latter will remain as an alias for the former.

For additional compatibility with third-party libraries, Matplotlib will continue to call the `cla` method of any <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> subclasses if they define it. In the future, this will no longer occur, and Matplotlib will only call the `clear` method in <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> subclasses.

It is recommended to define only the `clear` method when on Matplotlib 3.6, and only `cla` for older versions.

## Pending deprecation top-level cmap registration and access functions in `mpl.cm`

As part of a [multi-step process](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20853) we are refactoring the global state for managing the registered colormaps.

In Matplotlib 3.5 we added a <span class="title-ref">.ColormapRegistry</span> class and exposed an instance at the top level as `matplotlib.colormaps`. The existing top level functions in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm</span> (`get_cmap`, `register_cmap`, `unregister_cmap`) were changed to be aliases around the same instance.

In Matplotlib 3.6 we have marked those top level functions as pending deprecation with the intention of deprecation in Matplotlib 3.7. The following functions have been marked for pending deprecation:

  - `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`; use `matplotlib.colormaps[name]` instead if you have a <span class="title-ref">str</span>.
    
    **Added 3.6.1** Use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ColormapRegistry.get\_cmap</span> if you have a string, <span class="title-ref">None</span> or a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> object that you want to convert to a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> instance.

  - `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead

  - `matplotlib.cm.unregister_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.unregister \<.ColormapRegistry.unregister\></span> instead

  - `matplotlib.pyplot.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.get\_cmap</span> function will stay available for backward compatibility.

## Pending deprecation of layout methods

The methods <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.set\_tight\_layout</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.set\_constrained\_layout</span>, are discouraged, and now emit a <span class="title-ref">PendingDeprecationWarning</span> in favor of explicitly referencing the layout engine via `figure.set_layout_engine('tight')` and `figure.set_layout_engine('constrained')`. End users should not see the warning, but library authors should adjust.

The methods <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.set\_constrained\_layout\_pads</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.get\_constrained\_layout\_pads</span> are will be deprecated in favor of `figure.get_layout_engine().set()` and `figure.get_layout_engine().get()`, and currently emit a <span class="title-ref">PendingDeprecationWarning</span>.

## seaborn styles renamed

Matplotlib currently ships many style files inspired from the seaborn library ("seaborn", "seaborn-bright", "seaborn-colorblind", etc.) but they have gone out of sync with the library itself since the release of seaborn 0.9. To prevent confusion, the style files have been renamed "seaborn-v0\_8", "seaborn-v0\_8-bright", "seaborn-v0\_8-colorblind", etc. Users are encouraged to directly use seaborn to access the up-to-date styles.

## Auto-removal of overlapping Axes by `plt.subplot` and `plt.subplot2grid`

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot2grid</span> would automatically remove preexisting Axes that overlap with the newly added Axes. This behavior was deemed confusing, and is now deprecated. Explicitly call `ax.remove()` on Axes that need to be removed.

## Passing *linefmt* positionally to `stem` is undeprecated

Positional use of all formatting parameters in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stem</span> has been deprecated since Matplotlib 3.5. This deprecation is relaxed so that one can still pass *linefmt* positionally, i.e. `stem(x, y, 'r')`.

## `stem(..., use_line_collection=False)`

... is deprecated with no replacement. This was a compatibility fallback to a former more inefficient representation of the stem lines.

## Positional / keyword arguments

Passing all but the very few first arguments positionally in the constructors of Artists is deprecated. Most arguments will become keyword-only in a future version.

Passing too many positional arguments to `tripcolor` is now deprecated (extra arguments were previously silently ignored).

Passing *emit* and *auto* parameters of `set_xlim`, `set_ylim`, `set_zlim`, `set_rlim` positionally is deprecated; they will become keyword-only in a future release.

The *transOffset* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Collection.set\_offset\_transform</span> and the various `create_collection` methods of legend handlers has been renamed to *offset\_transform* (consistently with the property name).

Calling `MarkerStyle()` with no arguments or `MarkerStyle(None)` is deprecated; use `MarkerStyle("")` to construct an empty marker style.

`Axes.get_window_extent` / `Figure.get_window_extent` accept only *renderer*. This aligns the API with the general <span class="title-ref">.Artist.get\_window\_extent</span> API. All other parameters were ignored anyway.

The *cleared* parameter of `get_renderer`, which only existed for AGG-based backends, has been deprecated. Use `renderer.clear()` instead to explicitly clear the renderer buffer.

## Methods to set parameters in `LogLocator` and `LogFormatter*`

In <span class="title-ref">\~.LogFormatter</span> and derived subclasses, the methods `base` and `label_minor` for setting the respective parameter are deprecated and replaced by `set_base` and `set_label_minor`, respectively.

In <span class="title-ref">\~.LogLocator</span>, the methods `base` and `subs` for setting the respective parameter are deprecated. Instead, use `set_params(base=..., subs=...)`.

## `Axes.get_renderer_cache`

The canvas now takes care of the renderer and whether to cache it or not. The alternative is to call `axes.figure.canvas.get_renderer()`.

## Groupers from `get_shared_x_axes` / `get_shared_y_axes` will be immutable

Modifications to the Groupers returned by `get_shared_x_axes` and `get_shared_y_axes` are deprecated. In the future, these methods will return immutable views on the grouper structures. Note that previously, calling e.g. `join()` would already fail to set up the correct structures for sharing axes; use <span class="title-ref">.Axes.sharex</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Axes.sharey</span> instead.

## Unused methods in `Axis`, `Tick`, `XAxis`, and `YAxis`

`Tick.label` has been pending deprecation since 3.1 and is now deprecated. Use `Tick.label1` instead.

The following methods are no longer used and deprecated without a replacement:

  - `Axis.get_ticklabel_extents`
  - `Tick.get_pad_pixels`
  - `XAxis.get_text_heights`
  - `YAxis.get_text_widths`

## `mlab.stride_windows`

... is deprecated. Use `np.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view` instead (or `np.lib.stride_tricks.as_strided` on NumPy \< 1.20).

## Event handlers

The `draw_event`, `resize_event`, `close_event`, `key_press_event`, `key_release_event`, `pick_event`, `scroll_event`, `button_press_event`, `button_release_event`, `motion_notify_event`, `enter_notify_event` and `leave_notify_event` methods of <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase</span> are deprecated. They had inconsistent signatures across backends, and made it difficult to improve event metadata.

In order to trigger an event on a canvas, directly construct an <span class="title-ref">.Event</span> object of the correct class and call `canvas.callbacks.process(event.name, event)`.

## Widgets

All parameters to `MultiCursor` starting from *useblit* are becoming keyword-only (passing them positionally is deprecated).

The `canvas` and `background` attributes of `MultiCursor` are deprecated with no replacement.

The *visible* attribute of Selector widgets has been deprecated; use `set_visible` or `get_visible` instead.

The *state\_modifier\_keys* attribute of Selector widgets has been privatized and the modifier keys must be set when creating the widget.

## `Axes3D.dist`

... has been privatized. Use the *zoom* keyword argument in <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.set\_box\_aspect</span> instead.

## 3D Axis

The previous constructor of <span class="title-ref">.axis3d.Axis</span>, with signature `(self, adir, v_intervalx, d_intervalx, axes, *args, rotate_label=None, **kwargs)` is deprecated in favor of a new signature closer to the one of 2D Axis; it is now `(self, axes, *, rotate_label=None, **kwargs)` where `kwargs` are forwarded to the 2D Axis constructor. The axis direction is now inferred from the axis class' `axis_name` attribute (as in the 2D case); the `adir` attribute is deprecated.

The `init3d` method of 3D Axis is also deprecated; all the relevant initialization is done as part of the constructor.

The `d_interval` and `v_interval` attributes of 3D Axis are deprecated; use `get_data_interval` and `get_view_interval` instead.

The `w_xaxis`, `w_yaxis`, and `w_zaxis` attributes of `Axis3D` have been pending deprecation since 3.1. They are now deprecated. Instead use `xaxis`, `yaxis`, and `zaxis`.

`mplot3d.axis3d.Axis.set_pane_pos` is deprecated. This is an internal method where the provided values are overwritten during drawing. Hence, it does not serve any purpose to be directly accessible.

The two helper functions `mplot3d.axis3d.move_from_center` and `mplot3d.axis3d.tick_update_position` are considered internal and deprecated. If these are required, please vendor the code from the corresponding private methods `_move_from_center` and `_tick_update_position`.

## `Figure.callbacks` is deprecated

The Figure `callbacks` property is deprecated. The only signal was "dpi\_changed", which can be replaced by connecting to the "resize\_event" on the canvas `figure.canvas.mpl_connect("resize_event", func)` instead.

## `FigureCanvas` without a `required_interactive_framework` attribute

Support for such canvas classes is deprecated. Note that canvas classes which inherit from `FigureCanvasBase` always have such an attribute.

## Backend-specific deprecations

  - `backend_gtk3.FigureManagerGTK3Agg` and `backend_gtk4.FigureManagerGTK4Agg`; directly use `backend_gtk3.FigureManagerGTK3` and `backend_gtk4.FigureManagerGTK4` instead.
  - The *window* parameter to `backend_gtk3.NavigationToolbar2GTK3` had no effect, and is now deprecated.
  - `backend_gtk3.NavigationToolbar2GTK3.win`
  - `backend_gtk3.RendererGTK3Cairo` and `backend_gtk4.RendererGTK4Cairo`; use <span class="title-ref">.RendererCairo</span> instead, which has gained the `set_context` method, which also auto-infers the size of the underlying surface.
  - `backend_cairo.RendererCairo.set_ctx_from_surface` and `backend_cairo.RendererCairo.set_width_height` in favor of <span class="title-ref">.RendererCairo.set\_context</span>.
  - `backend_gtk3.error_msg_gtk`
  - `backend_gtk3.icon_filename` and `backend_gtk3.window_icon`
  - `backend_macosx.NavigationToolbar2Mac.prepare_configure_subplots` has been replaced by `configure_subplots()`.
  - `backend_pdf.Name.hexify`
  - `backend_pdf.Operator` and `backend_pdf.Op.op` are deprecated in favor of a single standard <span class="title-ref">enum.Enum</span> interface on <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.Op</span>.
  - `backend_pdf.fill`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on these functions.
  - `backend_pgf.LatexManager.texcommand` and `backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex_header`
  - `backend_pgf.NO_ESCAPE`
  - `backend_pgf.common_texification`
  - `backend_pgf.get_fontspec`
  - `backend_pgf.get_preamble`
  - `backend_pgf.re_mathsep`
  - `backend_pgf.writeln`
  - `backend_ps.convert_psfrags`
  - `backend_ps.quote_ps_string`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_qt.qApp`; use `QtWidgets.QApplication.instance()` instead.
  - `backend_svg.escape_attrib`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.escape_cdata`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.escape_comment`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.short_float_fmt`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.generate_transform` and `backend_svg.generate_css`
  - `backend_tk.NavigationToolbar2Tk.lastrect` and `backend_tk.RubberbandTk.lastrect`
  - `backend_tk.NavigationToolbar2Tk.window`; use `toolbar.master` instead.
  - `backend_tools.ToolBase.destroy`; To run code upon tool removal, connect to the `tool_removed_event` event.
  - `backend_wx.RendererWx.offset_text_height`
  - `backend_wx.error_msg_wx`
  - `FigureCanvasBase.pick`; directly call <span class="title-ref">.Figure.pick</span>, which has taken over the responsibility of checking the canvas widget lock as well.
  - `FigureCanvasBase.resize`, which has no effect; use `FigureManagerBase.resize` instead.
  - `FigureManagerMac.close`
  - `FigureFrameWx.sizer`; use `frame.GetSizer()` instead.
  - `FigureFrameWx.figmgr` and `FigureFrameWx.get_figure_manager`; use `frame.canvas.manager` instead.
  - `FigureFrameWx.num`; use `frame.canvas.manager.num` instead.
  - `FigureFrameWx.toolbar`; use `frame.GetToolBar()` instead.
  - `FigureFrameWx.toolmanager`; use `frame.canvas.manager.toolmanager` instead.

## Modules

The modules `matplotlib.afm`, `matplotlib.docstring`, `matplotlib.fontconfig_pattern`, `matplotlib.tight_bbox`, `matplotlib.tight_layout`, and `matplotlib.type1font` are considered internal and public access is deprecated.

## `checkdep_usetex` deprecated

This method was only intended to disable tests in case no latex install was found. As such, it is considered to be private and for internal use only.

Please vendor the code if you need this.

## `date_ticker_factory` deprecated

The `date_ticker_factory` method in the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates</span> module is deprecated. Instead use <span class="title-ref">\~.AutoDateLocator</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.AutoDateFormatter</span> for a more flexible and scalable locator and formatter.

If you need the exact `date_ticker_factory` behavior, please copy the code.

## `dviread.find_tex_file` will raise `FileNotFoundError`

In the future, `dviread.find_tex_file` will raise a <span class="title-ref">FileNotFoundError</span> for missing files. Previously, it would return an empty string in such cases. Raising an exception allows attaching a user-friendly message instead. During the transition period, a warning is raised.

## `transforms.Affine2D.identity()`

... is deprecated in favor of directly calling the <span class="title-ref">.Affine2D</span> constructor with no arguments.

## Deprecations in `testing.decorators`

The unused class `CleanupTestCase` and decorator `cleanup` are deprecated and will be removed. Vendor the code, including the private function `_cleanup_cm`.

The function `check_freetype_version` is considered internal and deprecated. Vendor the code of the private function `_check_freetype_version`.

## `text.get_rotation()`

... is deprecated with no replacement. Copy the original implementation if needed.

## Miscellaneous internals

  - `axes_grid1.axes_size.AddList`; use `sum(sizes, start=Fixed(0))` (for example) to sum multiple size objects.
  - `axes_size.Padded`; use `size + pad` instead
  - `axes_size.SizeFromFunc`, `axes_size.GetExtentHelper`
  - `AxisArtistHelper.delta1` and `AxisArtistHelper.delta2`
  - `axislines.GridHelperBase.new_gridlines` and `axislines.Axes.new_gridlines`
  - `cbook.maxdict`; use the standard library `functools.lru_cache` instead.
  - `_DummyAxis.dataLim` and `_DummyAxis.viewLim`; use `get_data_interval()`, `set_data_interval()`, `get_view_interval()`, and `set_view_interval()` instead.
  - `GridSpecBase.get_grid_positions(..., raw=True)`
  - `ImageMagickBase.delay` and `ImageMagickBase.output_args`
  - `MathtextBackend`, `MathtextBackendAgg`, `MathtextBackendPath`, `MathTextWarning`
  - `TexManager.get_font_config`; it previously returned an internal hashed key for used for caching purposes.
  - `TextToPath.get_texmanager`; directly construct a <span class="title-ref">.texmanager.TexManager</span> instead.
  - `ticker.is_close_to_int`; use `math.isclose(x, round(x))` instead.
  - `ticker.is_decade`; use `y = numpy.log(x)/numpy.log(base); numpy.isclose(y, numpy.round(y))` instead.

# Removals

The following deprecated APIs have been removed:

## Removed behaviour

### Stricter validation of function parameters

  - Unknown keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span>, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.savefig</span>, and the `FigureCanvas.print_*` methods now raise a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span>, instead of being ignored.
  - Extra parameters to the <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> constructor, i.e., those other than *fig* and *rect*, are now keyword only.
  - Passing arguments not specifically listed in the signatures of <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.plot\_wireframe</span> is no longer supported; pass any extra arguments as keyword arguments instead.
  - Passing positional arguments to <span class="title-ref">.LineCollection</span> has been removed; use specific keyword argument names now.

### `imread` no longer accepts URLs

Passing a URL to <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.imread()</span> has been removed. Please open the URL for reading and directly use the Pillow API (e.g., `PIL.Image.open(urllib.request.urlopen(url))`, or `PIL.Image.open(io.BytesIO(requests.get(url).content))`) instead.

### MarkerStyle is immutable

The methods `MarkerStyle.set_fillstyle` and `MarkerStyle.set_marker` have been removed. Create a new <span class="title-ref">.MarkerStyle</span> with the respective parameters instead.

### Passing bytes to `FT2Font.set_text`

... is no longer supported. Pass <span class="title-ref">str</span> instead.

### Support for passing tool names to `ToolManager.add_tool`

... has been removed. The second parameter to <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager.add\_tool</span> must now always be a tool class.

### `backend_tools.ToolFullScreen` now inherits from `ToolBase`, not from `ToolToggleBase`

<span class="title-ref">.ToolFullScreen</span> can only switch between the non-fullscreen and fullscreen states, but not unconditionally put the window in a given state; hence the `enable` and `disable` methods were misleadingly named. Thus, the <span class="title-ref">.ToolToggleBase</span>-related API (`enable`, `disable`, etc.) was removed.

### `BoxStyle._Base` and `transmute` method of box styles

... have been removed. Box styles implemented as classes no longer need to inherit from a base class.

### Loaded modules logging

The list of currently loaded modules is no longer logged at the DEBUG level at Matplotlib import time, because it can produce extensive output and make other valuable DEBUG statements difficult to find. If you were relying on this output, please arrange for your own logging (the built-in <span class="title-ref">sys.modules</span> can be used to get the currently loaded modules).

## Modules

  - The `cbook.deprecation` module has been removed from the public API as it is considered internal.
  - The `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` module has been removed. All functionality from `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` can be found in either <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1</span> or <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span>. Axes classes from `mpl_toolkits.axes_grid` based on `Axis` from <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span> can be found in <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axisartist</span>.

## Classes, methods and attributes

  - `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.ParasiteAxesAuxTrans`; use <span class="title-ref">.ParasiteAxes</span> instead.

The following class attributes have been removed:

  - `Line2D.validCap` and `Line2D.validJoin`; validation is centralized in `rcsetup`.
  - `Patch.validCap` and `Patch.validJoin`; validation is centralized in `rcsetup`.
  - `renderer.M`, `renderer.eye`, `renderer.vvec`, `renderer.get_axis_position` placed on the Renderer during 3D Axes draw; these attributes are all available via <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span>, which can be accessed via `self.axes` on all <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s.
  - `RendererPdf.mathtext_parser`, `RendererPS.mathtext_parser`, `RendererSVG.mathtext_parser`, `RendererCairo.mathtext_parser`
  - `StandardPsFonts.pswriter`

  - `Subplot.numCols`; `ax.get_gridspec().ncols` instead.
  - `SubplotDivider.figbox`
  - `cids`, `cnt`, `observers`, `change_observers`, and `submit_observers` on all <span class="title-ref">.Widget</span>s

The following class methods have been removed:

  - `Axis.cla()`; use <span class="title-ref">.Axis.clear</span> instead.
  - `RadialAxis.cla()` and `ThetaAxis.cla()`; use <span class="title-ref">.RadialAxis.clear</span> or <span class="title-ref">.ThetaAxis.clear</span> instead.
  - `Spine.cla()`; use <span class="title-ref">.Spine.clear</span> instead.
  - `ContourLabeler.get_label_coords()`; there is no replacement as it was considered an internal helper.
  - `FancyArrowPatch.get_dpi_cor` and `FancyArrowPatch.set_dpi_cor`
  - `FigureCanvas.get_window_title()` and `FigureCanvas.set_window_title()`; use <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase.get\_window\_title</span> or <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase.set\_window\_title</span> if using pyplot, or use GUI-specific methods if embedding.
  - `FigureManager.key_press()` and `FigureManager.button_press()`; trigger the events directly on the canvas using `canvas.callbacks.process(event.name, event)` for key and button events.
  - `RendererAgg.get_content_extents()` and `RendererAgg.tostring_rgba_minimized()`
  - `NavigationToolbar2Wx.get_canvas()`
  - `ParasiteAxesBase.update_viewlim()`; use `ParasiteAxesBase.apply_aspect` instead.
  - `Subplot.get_geometry()`; use `SubplotBase.get_subplotspec` instead.
  - `Subplot.change_geometry()`; use `SubplotBase.set_subplotspec` instead.
  - `Subplot.update_params()`; this method did nothing.
  - `Subplot.is_first_row()`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().is_first_row` instead.
  - `Subplot.is_first_col()`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().is_first_col` instead.
  - `Subplot.is_last_row()`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().is_last_row` instead.
  - `Subplot.is_last_col()`; use `ax.get_subplotspec().is_last_col` instead.

  - `SubplotDivider.update_params()`
  - `get_depth`, `parse`, `to_mask`, `to_rgba`, and `to_png` of <span class="title-ref">.MathTextParser</span>; use <span class="title-ref">.mathtext.math\_to\_image</span> instead.
  - `MovieWriter.cleanup()`; the cleanup logic is instead fully implemented in <span class="title-ref">.MovieWriter.finish</span> and `cleanup` is no longer called.

## Functions

The following functions have been removed;

  - `backend_template.new_figure_manager()`, `backend_template.new_figure_manager_given_figure()`, and `backend_template.draw_if_interactive()` have been removed, as part of the introduction of the simplified backend API.
  - Deprecation-related re-imports `cbook.deprecated()`, and `cbook.warn_deprecated()`.
  - `colorbar.colorbar_factory()`; use <span class="title-ref">.Colorbar</span> instead. `colorbar.make_axes_kw_doc()`
  - `mathtext.Error()`
  - `mathtext.ship()`
  - `mathtext.tex2uni()`
  - `axes_grid1.parasite_axes.parasite_axes_auxtrans_class_factory()`; use <span class="title-ref">.parasite\_axes\_class\_factory</span> instead.
  - `sphinext.plot_directive.align()`; use `docutils.parsers.rst.directives.images.Image.align` instead.

## Arguments

The following arguments have been removed:

  - *dpi* from `print_ps()` in the PS backend and `print_pdf()` in the PDF backend. Instead, the methods will obtain the DPI from the `savefig` machinery.
  - *dpi\_cor* from <span class="title-ref">\~.FancyArrowPatch</span>
  - *minimum\_descent* from `TextArea`; it is now effectively always True
  - *origin* from `FigureCanvasWx.gui_repaint()`
  - *project* from `Line3DCollection.draw()`
  - *renderer* from <span class="title-ref">.Line3DCollection.do\_3d\_projection</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Patch3D.do\_3d\_projection</span>, <span class="title-ref">.PathPatch3D.do\_3d\_projection</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Path3DCollection.do\_3d\_projection</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Patch3DCollection.do\_3d\_projection</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Poly3DCollection.do\_3d\_projection</span>
  - *resize\_callback* from the Tk backend; use `get_tk_widget().bind('<Configure>', ..., True)` instead.
  - *return\_all* from `gridspec.get_position()`

# API Changes for 3.6.1

## Deprecations

### Colorbars for orphaned mappables are deprecated, but no longer raise

Before 3.6.0, Colorbars for mappables that do not have a parent Axes would steal space from the current Axes. 3.6.0 raised an error on this, but without a deprecation cycle. For 3.6.1 this is reverted; the current Axes is used, but a deprecation warning is shown instead. In this undetermined case, users and libraries should explicitly specify what Axes they want space to be stolen from: `fig.colorbar(mappable, ax=plt.gca())`.

---

behaviour.md

---

# Behaviour Changes

## All Axes have `get_subplotspec` and `get_gridspec` methods now, which returns None for Axes not positioned via a gridspec

Previously, this method was only present for Axes positioned via a gridspec. Following this change, checking `hasattr(ax, "get_gridspec")` should now be replaced by `ax.get_gridspec() is not None`. For compatibility with older Matplotlib releases, one can also check `hasattr(ax, "get_gridspec") and ax.get_gridspec() is not None`.

## `HostAxesBase.get_aux_axes` now defaults to using the same base axes class as the host axes

If using an `mpl_toolkits.axisartist`-based host Axes, the parasite Axes will also be based on `mpl_toolkits.axisartist`. This behavior is consistent with `HostAxesBase.twin`, `HostAxesBase.twinx`, and `HostAxesBase.twiny`.

## `plt.get_cmap` and `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` return a copy

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.get\_cmap</span> and `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` returned a global version of a <span class="title-ref">.Colormap</span>. This was prone to errors as modification of the colormap would propagate from one location to another without warning. Now, a new copy of the colormap is returned.

## `TrapezoidMapTriFinder` uses different random number generator

The random number generator used to determine the order of insertion of triangle edges in `TrapezoidMapTriFinder` has changed. This can result in a different triangle index being returned for a point that lies exactly on an edge between two triangles. This can also affect triangulation interpolation and refinement algorithms that use `TrapezoidMapTriFinder`.

## `FuncAnimation(save_count=None)`

Passing `save_count=None` to <span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> no longer limits the number of frames to 100. Make sure that it either can be inferred from *frames* or provide an integer *save\_count*.

## `CenteredNorm` halfrange is not modified when vcenter changes

Previously, the **halfrange** would expand in proportion to the amount that **vcenter** was moved away from either **vmin** or **vmax**. Now, the halfrange remains fixed when vcenter is changed, and **vmin** and **vmax** are updated based on the **vcenter** and **halfrange** values.

For example, this is what the values were when changing vcenter previously.

`` `python     norm = CenteredNorm(vcenter=0, halfrange=1)     # Move vcenter up by one     norm.vcenter = 1     # updates halfrange and vmax (vmin stays the same)     # norm.halfrange == 2, vmin == -1, vmax == 3  and now, with that same example  .. code-block:: python      norm = CenteredNorm(vcenter=0, halfrange=1)     norm.vcenter = 1     # updates vmin and vmax (halfrange stays the same)     # norm.halfrange == 1, vmin == 0, vmax == 2  The **halfrange** can be set manually or ``norm.autoscale()`  `\` can be used to automatically set the limits after setting **vcenter**.

## `fig.subplot_mosaic` no longer passes the `gridspec_kw` args to nested gridspecs.

For nested <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span> layouts, it is almost always inappropriate for *gridspec\_kw* arguments to be passed to lower nest levels, and these arguments are incompatible with the lower levels in many cases. This dictionary is no longer passed to the inner layouts. Users who need to modify *gridspec\_kw* at multiple levels should use <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subfigures</span> to get nesting, and construct the inner layouts with <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplots</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span>.

## `HPacker` alignment with **bottom** or **top** are now correct

Previously, the **bottom** and **top** alignments were swapped. This has been corrected so that the alignments correspond appropriately.

## On Windows only fonts known to the registry will be discovered

Previously, Matplotlib would recursively walk user and system font directories to discover fonts, however this lead to a number of undesirable behaviors including finding deleted fonts. Now Matplotlib will only find fonts that are known to the Windows registry.

This means that any user installed fonts must go through the Windows font installer rather than simply being copied to the correct folder.

This only impacts the set of fonts Matplotlib will consider when using <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.font\_manager.findfont</span>. To use an arbitrary font, directly pass the path to a font as shown in \[/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/font\_file\](/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/font\_file.md).

## `QuadMesh.set_array` now always raises `ValueError` for inputs with incorrect shapes

It could previously also raise <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> in some cases.

## `contour` and `contourf` auto-select suitable levels when given boolean inputs

If the height array given to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contour</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contourf</span> is of bool dtype and *levels* is not specified, *levels* now defaults to `[0.5]` for <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.contour</span> and `[0, 0.5, 1]` for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contourf</span>.

## `contour` no longer warns if no contour lines are drawn.

This can occur if the user explicitly passes a `levels` array with no values between `z.min()` and `z.max()`; or if `z` has the same value everywhere.

## `AxesImage.set_extent` now raises `TypeError` for unknown keyword arguments

It previously raised a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.

## Change of `legend(loc="best")` behavior

The algorithm of the auto-legend locator has been tweaked to better handle non rectangular patches. Additional details on this change can be found in `9580` and `9598`.

deprecations.md

---

# Deprecations

## `Axes` subclasses should override `clear` instead of `cla`

For clarity, <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.clear</span> is now preferred over <span class="title-ref">.Axes.cla</span>. However, for backwards compatibility, the latter will remain as an alias for the former.

For additional compatibility with third-party libraries, Matplotlib will continue to call the `cla` method of any <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> subclasses if they define it. In the future, this will no longer occur, and Matplotlib will only call the `clear` method in <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> subclasses.

It is recommended to define only the `clear` method when on Matplotlib 3.6, and only `cla` for older versions.

## rcParams type

Relying on `rcParams` being a `dict` subclass is deprecated.

Nothing will change for regular users because `rcParams` will continue to be dict-like (technically fulfill the `MutableMapping` interface).

The <span class="title-ref">.RcParams</span> class does validation checking on calls to `.RcParams.__getitem__` and `.RcParams.__setitem__`. However, there are rare cases where we want to circumvent the validation logic and directly access the underlying data values. Previously, this could be accomplished via a call to the parent methods `dict.__getitem__(rcParams, key)` and `dict.__setitem__(rcParams, key, val)`.

Matplotlib 3.7 introduces `rcParams._set(key, val)` and `rcParams._get(key)` as a replacement to calling the parent methods. They are intentionally marked private to discourage external use; However, if direct <span class="title-ref">.RcParams</span> data access is needed, please switch from the dict functions to the new `_get()` and `_set()`. Even though marked private, we guarantee API stability for these methods and they are subject to Matplotlib's API and deprecation policy.

Please notify the Matplotlib developers if you rely on `rcParams` being a dict subclass in any other way, for which there is no migration path yet.

## Deprecation aliases in cbook

The module `matplotlib.cbook.deprecation` was previously deprecated in Matplotlib 3.4, along with deprecation-related API in `matplotlib.cbook`. Due to technical issues, `matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` and `matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation` did not raise deprecation warnings on use. Changes in Python have now made it possible to warn when these aliases are being used.

In order to avoid downstream breakage, these aliases will now warn, and their removal has been pushed from 3.6 to 3.8 to give time to notice said warnings. As replacement, please use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span>.

## `draw_gouraud_triangle`

... is deprecated as in most backends this is a redundant call. Use <span class="title-ref">\~.RendererBase.draw\_gouraud\_triangles</span> instead. A `draw_gouraud_triangle` call in a custom <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.artist.Artist</span> can readily be replaced as:

    self.draw_gouraud_triangles(gc, points.reshape((1, 3, 2)),
                                colors.reshape((1, 3, 4)), trans)

A <span class="title-ref">\~.RendererBase.draw\_gouraud\_triangles</span> method can be implemented from an existing `draw_gouraud_triangle` method as:

    transform = transform.frozen()
    for tri, col in zip(triangles_array, colors_array):
        self.draw_gouraud_triangle(gc, tri, col, transform)

## `matplotlib.pyplot.get_plot_commands`

... is a pending deprecation. This is considered internal and no end-user should need it.

## `matplotlib.tri` submodules are deprecated

The `matplotlib.tri.*` submodules are deprecated. All functionality is available in `matplotlib.tri` directly and should be imported from there.

## Passing undefined *label\_mode* to `Grid`

... is deprecated. This includes <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.Grid</span>, <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.AxesGrid</span>, and <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span> as well as the corresponding classes imported from `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_grid`.

Pass `label_mode='keep'` instead to get the previous behavior of not modifying labels.

## Colorbars for orphaned mappables are deprecated, but no longer raise

Before 3.6.0, Colorbars for mappables that do not have a parent axes would steal space from the current Axes. 3.6.0 raised an error on this, but without a deprecation cycle. For 3.6.1 this is reverted, the current axes is used, but a deprecation warning is shown instead. In this undetermined case users and libraries should explicitly specify what axes they want space to be stolen from: `fig.colorbar(mappable, ax=plt.gca())`.

## `Animation` attributes

The attributes `repeat` of <span class="title-ref">.TimedAnimation</span> and subclasses and `save_count` of <span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> are considered private and deprecated.

## `contour.ClabelText` and `ContourLabeler.set_label_props`

... are deprecated.

Use `Text(..., transform_rotates_text=True)` as a replacement for `contour.ClabelText(...)` and `text.set(text=text, color=color, fontproperties=labeler.labelFontProps, clip_box=labeler.axes.bbox)` as a replacement for the `ContourLabeler.set_label_props(label, text, color)`.

## `ContourLabeler` attributes

The `labelFontProps`, `labelFontSizeList`, and `labelTextsList` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.ContourLabeler</span> have been deprecated. Use the `labelTexts` attribute and the font properties of the corresponding text objects instead.

## `backend_ps.PsBackendHelper` and `backend_ps.ps_backend_helper`

... are deprecated with no replacement.

## `backend_webagg.ServerThread` is deprecated

... with no replacement.

## `parse_fontconfig_pattern` will no longer ignore unknown constant names

Previously, in a fontconfig pattern like `DejaVu Sans:foo`, the unknown `foo` constant name would be silently ignored. This now raises a warning, and will become an error in the future.

## `BufferRegion.to_string` and `BufferRegion.to_string_argb`

... are deprecated. Use `np.asarray(buffer_region)` to get an array view on a buffer region without making a copy; to convert that view from RGBA (the default) to ARGB, use `np.take(..., [2, 1, 0, 3], axis=2)`.

## `num2julian`, `julian2num` and `JULIAN_OFFSET`

... of the <span class="title-ref">.dates</span> module are deprecated without replacements. These are undocumented and not exported. If you rely on these, please make a local copy.

## `unit_cube`, `tunit_cube`, and `tunit_edges`

... of <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D</span> are deprecated without replacements. If you rely on them, please copy the code of the corresponding private function (name starting with `_`).

## Most arguments to widgets have been made keyword-only

Passing all but the very few first arguments positionally in the constructors of Widgets is deprecated. Most arguments will become keyword-only in a future version.

## `SimpleEvent`

The `SimpleEvent` nested class (previously accessible via the public subclasses of `ConnectionStyle._Base`, such as <span class="title-ref">.ConnectionStyle.Arc</span>, has been deprecated.

## `RadioButtons.circles`

... is deprecated. (RadioButtons now draws itself using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>.)

## `CheckButtons.rectangles` and `CheckButtons.lines`

`CheckButtons.rectangles` and `CheckButtons.lines` are deprecated. (`CheckButtons` now draws itself using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>.)

## `OffsetBox.get_extent_offsets` and `OffsetBox.get_extent`

... are deprecated; these methods are also deprecated on all subclasses of <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span>.

To get the offsetbox extents, instead of `get_extent`, use <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox.get\_bbox</span>, which directly returns a <span class="title-ref">.Bbox</span> instance.

To also get the child offsets, instead of `get_extent_offsets`, separately call <span class="title-ref">\~.OffsetBox.get\_offset</span> on each children after triggering a draw.

## `legend.legendHandles`

... was undocumented and has been renamed to `legend_handles`. Using `legendHandles` is deprecated.

## `ticklabels` parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticklabels</span> renamed to `labels`

## `offsetbox.bbox_artist`

... is deprecated. This is just a wrapper to call <span class="title-ref">.patches.bbox\_artist</span> if a flag is set in the file, so use that directly if you need the behavior.

## `Quiver.quiver_doc` and `Barbs.barbs_doc`

... are deprecated. These are the doc-string and should not be accessible as a named class member.

## Deprecate unused parameter *x* to `TextBox.begin_typing`

This parameter was unused in the method, but was a required argument.

## Deprecation of top-level cmap registration and access functions in `mpl.cm`

As part of a [multi-step process](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20853) we are refactoring the global state for managing the registered colormaps.

In Matplotlib 3.5 we added a <span class="title-ref">.ColormapRegistry</span> class and exposed an instance at the top level as `matplotlib.colormaps`. The existing top level functions in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm</span> (`get_cmap`, `register_cmap`, `unregister_cmap`) were changed to be aliases around the same instance. In Matplotlib 3.6 we have marked those top level functions as pending deprecation.

In Matplotlib 3.7, the following functions have been marked for deprecation:

  - `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`; use `matplotlib.colormaps[name]` instead if you have a <span class="title-ref">str</span>.
    
    **Added 3.6.1** Use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ColormapRegistry.get\_cmap</span> if you have a string, <span class="title-ref">None</span> or a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> object that you want to convert to a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> instance.

  - `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead

  - `matplotlib.cm.unregister_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.unregister \<.ColormapRegistry.unregister\></span> instead

  - `matplotlib.pyplot.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.get\_cmap</span> function will stay available for backward compatibility.

## `BrokenBarHCollection` is deprecated

It was just a thin wrapper inheriting from <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span>; <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.broken\_barh</span> has now been changed to return a <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span> instead.

The `BrokenBarHCollection.span_where` helper is likewise deprecated; for the duration of the deprecation it has been moved to the parent <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span> class. Use <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.fill\_between</span> as a replacement; see \[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/span\_regions\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/span\_regions.md) for an example.

## Passing inconsistent `loc` and `nth_coord` to axisartist helpers

Trying to construct for example a "top y-axis" or a "left x-axis" is now deprecated.

## `passthru_pt`

This attribute of `AxisArtistHelper`s is deprecated.

## `axes3d.vvec`, `axes3d.eye`, `axes3d.sx`, and `axes3d.sy`

... are deprecated without replacement.

## `Line2D`

When creating a Line2D or using <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_xdata</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_ydata</span>, passing x/y data as non sequence is deprecated.

# Development changes

## Windows wheel runtime bundling

Wheels built for Windows now bundle the MSVC runtime DLL `msvcp140.dll`. This enables importing Matplotlib on systems that do not have the runtime installed.

## Increase to minimum supported versions of dependencies

For Matplotlib 3.7, the \[minimum supported versions \<dependencies\>\](\#minimum-supported-versions-\<dependencies\>) are being bumped:

<table style="width:68%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 18%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Dependency</th>
<th>min in mpl3.6</th>
<th>min in mpl3.7</th>

<tbody>
<tr class="odd">

</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>Qt</p>

<td></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>5.10</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  - There are no wheels or conda packages that support both Qt 5.9 (or older) and Python 3.8 (or newer).

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy) and [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

## New dependencies

  - [importlib-resources](https://pypi.org/project/importlib-resources/) (\>= 3.2.0; only required on Python \< 3.10)

## Maximum line length increased to 88 characters

The maximum line length for new contributions has been extended from 79 characters to 88 characters. This change provides an extra 9 characters to allow code which is a single idea to fit on fewer lines (often a single line). The chosen length is the same as [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#line-length).

# Removals

## `epoch2num` and `num2epoch` are removed

These methods convert from unix timestamps to matplotlib floats, but are not used internally to Matplotlib, and should not be needed by end users. To convert a unix timestamp to datetime, simply use <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp</span>, or to use NumPy <span class="title-ref">\~numpy.datetime64</span> `dt = np.datetime64(e*1e6, 'us')`.

## Locator and Formatter wrapper methods

The `set_view_interval`, `set_data_interval` and `set_bounds` methods of <span class="title-ref">.Locator</span>s and <span class="title-ref">.Formatter</span>s (and their common base class, TickHelper) are removed. Directly manipulate the view and data intervals on the underlying axis instead.

## Interactive cursor details

Setting a mouse cursor on a window has been moved from the toolbar to the canvas. Consequently, several implementation details on toolbars and within backends have been removed.

### `NavigationToolbar2.set_cursor` and `backend_tools.SetCursorBase.set_cursor`

Instead, use the <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase.set\_cursor</span> method on the canvas (available as the `canvas` attribute on the toolbar or the Figure.)

### `backend_tools.SetCursorBase` and subclasses

`backend_tools.SetCursorBase` was subclassed to provide backend-specific implementations of `set_cursor`. As that is now removed, the subclassing is no longer necessary. Consequently, the following subclasses are also removed:

  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_gtk3.SetCursorGTK3`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_qt5.SetCursorQt`
  - `matplotlib.backends._backend_tk.SetCursorTk`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_wx.SetCursorWx`

Instead, use the <span class="title-ref">.backend\_tools.ToolSetCursor</span> class.

### `cursord` in GTK and wx backends

The `backend_gtk3.cursord` and `backend_wx.cursord` dictionaries are removed. This makes the GTK module importable on headless environments.

## `auto_add_to_figure=True` for `Axes3D`

... is no longer supported. Instead use `fig.add_axes(ax)`.

## The first parameter of `Axes.grid` and `Axis.grid` has been renamed to *visible*

The parameter was previously named *b*. This name change only matters if that parameter was passed using a keyword argument, e.g. `grid(b=False)`.

## Removal of deprecations in the Selector widget API

### RectangleSelector and EllipseSelector

The *drawtype* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> is removed. From now on, the only behaviour will be `drawtype='box'`.

Support for `drawtype=line` is removed altogether. As a result, the *lineprops* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> is also removed.

To retain the behaviour of `drawtype='none'`, use `rectprops={'visible': False}` to make the drawn <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle</span> invisible.

Cleaned up attributes and arguments are:

  - The `active_handle` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `drawtype` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `eventpress` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `eventrelease` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `interactive` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The *marker\_props* argument is removed, use *handle\_props* instead.
  - The *maxdist* argument is removed, use *grab\_range* instead.
  - The *rectprops* argument is removed, use *props* instead.
  - The `rectprops` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `state` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `to_draw` attribute has been privatized and removed.

### PolygonSelector

  - The *line* attribute is removed. If you want to change the selector artist properties, use the `set_props` or `set_handle_props` methods.
  - The *lineprops* argument is removed, use *props* instead.
  - The *markerprops* argument is removed, use *handle\_props* instead.
  - The *maxdist* argument and attribute is removed, use *grab\_range* instead.
  - The *vertex\_select\_radius* argument and attribute is removed, use *grab\_range* instead.

### SpanSelector

  - The `active_handle` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `eventpress` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `eventrelease` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `pressv` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `prev` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `rect` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The *rectprops* parameter has been renamed to *props*.
  - The `rectprops` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The *span\_stays* parameter has been renamed to *interactive*.
  - The `span_stays` attribute has been privatized and removed.
  - The `state` attribute has been privatized and removed.

### LassoSelector

  - The *lineprops* argument is removed, use *props* instead.
  - The `onpress` and `onrelease` methods are removed. They are straight aliases for `press` and `release`.
  - The `matplotlib.widgets.TextBox.DIST_FROM_LEFT` attribute has been removed. It was marked as private in 3.5.

## `backend_template.show`

... has been removed, in order to better demonstrate the new backend definition API.

## Unused positional parameters to `print_<fmt>` methods

None of the `print_<fmt>` methods implemented by canvas subclasses used positional arguments other that the first (the output filename or file-like), so these extra parameters are removed.

## `QuadMesh` signature

The <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh</span> signature :

    def __init__(meshWidth, meshHeight, coordinates,
                 antialiased=True, shading='flat', **kwargs)

is removed and replaced by the new signature :

    def __init__(coordinates, *, antialiased=True, shading='flat', **kwargs)

In particular:

  - The *coordinates* argument must now be a (M, N, 2) array-like. Previously, the grid shape was separately specified as (*meshHeight* + 1, *meshWidth* +
    
    1\) and *coordinates* could be an array-like of any shape with M \* N \* 2 elements.

  - All parameters except *coordinates* are keyword-only now.

## Expiration of `FancyBboxPatch` deprecations

The <span class="title-ref">.FancyBboxPatch</span> constructor no longer accepts the *bbox\_transmuter* parameter, nor can the *boxstyle* parameter be set to "custom" -- instead, directly set *boxstyle* to the relevant boxstyle instance. The *mutation\_scale* and *mutation\_aspect* parameters have also become keyword-only.

The *mutation\_aspect* parameter is now handled internally and no longer passed to the boxstyle callables when mutating the patch path.

## Testing support

### `matplotlib.test()` has been removed

Run tests using `pytest` from the commandline instead. The variable `matplotlib.default_test_modules` was only used for `matplotlib.test()` and is thus removed as well.

To test an installed copy, be sure to specify both `matplotlib` and `mpl_toolkits` with `--pyargs`:

    pytest --pyargs matplotlib.tests mpl_toolkits.tests

See \[testing\](\#testing) for more details.

## Auto-removal of grids by <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span>

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> previously remove any visible axes major grid. This behavior is removed; please explicitly call `ax.grid(False)` to remove the grid.

## Modification of `Axes` children sublists

See \[Behavioural API Changes 3.5 - Axes children combined\](\#behavioural-api-changes-3.5---axes-children-combined) for more information; modification of the following sublists is no longer supported:

  - `Axes.artists`
  - `Axes.collections`
  - `Axes.images`
  - `Axes.lines`
  - `Axes.patches`
  - `Axes.tables`
  - `Axes.texts`

To remove an Artist, use its <span class="title-ref">.Artist.remove</span> method. To add an Artist, use the corresponding `Axes.add_*` method.

## Passing incorrect types to `Axes.add_*` methods

The following `Axes.add_*` methods will now raise if passed an unexpected type. See their documentation for the types they expect.

  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_collection</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_image</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_line</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_patch</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_table</span>

## `ConversionInterface.convert` no longer accepts unitless values

Previously, custom subclasses of <span class="title-ref">.units.ConversionInterface</span> needed to implement a `convert` method that not only accepted instances of the unit, but also unitless values (which are passed through as is). This is no longer the case (`convert` is never called with a unitless value), and such support in `.StrCategoryConverter` is removed. Likewise, the `.ConversionInterface.is_numlike` helper is removed.

Consider calling <span class="title-ref">.Axis.convert\_units</span> instead, which still supports unitless values.

## Normal list of <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> objects now returned by <span class="title-ref">.HandlerLine2D.create\_artists</span>

For Matplotlib 3.5 and 3.6 a proxy list was returned that simulated the return of <span class="title-ref">.HandlerLine2DCompound.create\_artists</span>. Now a list containing only the single artist is return.

## rcParams will no longer cast inputs to str

rcParams that expect a (non-pathlike) str no longer cast non-str inputs using <span class="title-ref">str</span>. This will avoid confusing errors in subsequent code if e.g. a list input gets implicitly cast to a str.

## Case-insensitive scales

Previously, scales could be set case-insensitively (e.g., `set_xscale("LoG")`). Now all builtin scales use lowercase names.

## Support for `nx1 = None` or `ny1 = None` in `AxesLocator` and `Divider.locate`

In <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider</span>, various internal APIs no longer supports passing `nx1 = None` or `ny1 = None` to mean `nx + 1` or `ny + 1`, in preparation for a possible future API which allows indexing and slicing of dividers (possibly `divider[a:b] == divider.new_locator(a, b)`, but also `divider[a:] == divider.new_locator(a, <end>)`). The user-facing <span class="title-ref">.Divider.new\_locator</span> API is unaffected -- it correctly normalizes `nx1 = None` and `ny1 = None` as needed.

## change signature of `.FigureCanvasBase.enter_notify_event`

The *xy* parameter is now required and keyword only. This was deprecated in 3.0 and originally slated to be removed in 3.5.

## `Colorbar` tick update parameters

The *update\_ticks* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Colorbar.set\_ticks</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Colorbar.set\_ticklabels</span> was ignored since 3.5 and has been removed.

## plot directive removals

The public methods:

  - `matplotlib.sphinxext.split_code_at_show`
  - `matplotlib.sphinxext.unescape_doctest`
  - `matplotlib.sphinxext.run_code`

have been removed.

The deprecated *encoding* option to the plot directive has been removed.

## Miscellaneous removals

  - `is_url` and `URL_REGEX` are removed. (They were previously defined in the toplevel `matplotlib` module.)
  - The `ArrowStyle.beginarrow` and `ArrowStyle.endarrow` attributes are removed; use the `arrow` attribute to define the desired heads and tails of the arrow.
  - `backend_pgf.LatexManager.str_cache` is removed.
  - `backends.qt_compat.ETS` and `backends.qt_compat.QT_RC_MAJOR_VERSION` are removed, with no replacement.
  - The `blocking_input` module is removed. Instead, use `canvas.start_event_loop()` and `canvas.stop_event_loop()` while connecting event callbacks as needed.
  - `cbook.report_memory` is removed; use `psutil.virtual_memory` instead.
  - `cm.LUTSIZE` is removed. Use `image.lut` instead. This value only affects colormap quantization levels for default colormaps generated at module import time.
  - `Colorbar.patch` is removed; this attribute was not correctly updated anymore.
  - `ContourLabeler.get_label_width` is removed.
  - `Dvi.baseline` is removed (with no replacement).
  - The *format* parameter of `dviread.find_tex_file` is removed (with no replacement).
  - `FancyArrowPatch.get_path_in_displaycoord` and `ConnectionPath.get_path_in_displaycoord` are removed. The path in display coordinates can still be obtained, as for other patches, using `patch.get_transform().transform_path(patch.get_path())`.
  - The `font_manager.win32InstalledFonts` and `font_manager.get_fontconfig_fonts` helper functions are removed.
  - All parameters of `imshow` starting from *aspect* are keyword-only.
  - `QuadMesh.convert_mesh_to_paths` and `QuadMesh.convert_mesh_to_triangles` are removed. `QuadMesh.get_paths()` can be used as an alternative for the former; there is no replacement for the latter.
  - `ScalarMappable.callbacksSM` is removed. Use `ScalarMappable.callbacks` instead.
  - `streamplot.get_integrator` is removed.
  - `style.core.STYLE_FILE_PATTERN`, `style.core.load_base_library`, and `style.core.iter_user_libraries` are removed.
  - `SubplotParams.validate` is removed. Use <span class="title-ref">.SubplotParams.update</span> to change <span class="title-ref">.SubplotParams</span> while always keeping it in a valid state.
  - The `grey_arrayd`, `font_family`, `font_families`, and `font_info` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.TexManager</span> are removed.
  - `Text.get_prop_tup` is removed with no replacements (because the <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> class cannot know whether a backend needs to update cache e.g. when the text's color changes).
  - `Tick.apply_tickdir` didn't actually update the tick markers on the existing Line2D objects used to draw the ticks and is removed; use <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span> instead.
  - `tight_layout.auto_adjust_subplotpars` is removed.
  - The `grid_info` attribute of `axisartist` classes has been removed.
  - `axes_grid1.axes_grid.CbarAxes` and `axisartist.axes_grid.CbarAxes` are removed (they are now dynamically generated based on the owning axes class).
  - The `axes_grid1.Divider.get_vsize_hsize` and `axes_grid1.Grid.get_vsize_hsize` methods are removed.
  - `AxesDivider.append_axes(..., add_to_figure=False)` is removed. Use `ax.remove()` to remove the Axes from the figure if needed.
  - `FixedAxisArtistHelper.change_tick_coord` is removed with no replacement.
  - `floating_axes.GridHelperCurveLinear.get_boundary` is removed with no replacement.
  - `ParasiteAxesBase.get_images_artists` is removed.
  - The "units finalize" signal (previously emitted by Axis instances) is removed. Connect to "units" instead.
  - Passing formatting parameters positionally to `stem()` is no longer possible.
  - `axisartist.clip_path` is removed with no replacement.

# Behaviour Changes

## Tk backend respects file format selection when saving figures

When saving a figure from a Tkinter GUI to a filename without an extension, the file format is now selected based on the value of the dropdown menu, rather than defaulting to PNG. When the filename contains an extension, or the OS automatically appends one, the behavior remains unchanged.

## Placing of maximum and minimum minor ticks

Calculation of minor tick locations has been corrected to make the maximum and minimum minor ticks more consistent. In some cases this results in an extra minor tick on an Axis.

## `hexbin` now defaults to `rcParams["patch.linewidth"]`

The default value of the *linewidths* argument of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hexbin</span> has been changed from `1.0` to `patch.linewidth`. This improves the consistency with <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh</span> in <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolormesh</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hist2d</span>.

## TwoSlopeNorm now auto-expands to always have two slopes

In the case where either `vmin` or `vmax` are not manually specified to <span class="title-ref">\~.TwoSlopeNorm</span>, and where the data it is scaling is all less than or greater than the center point, the limits are now auto-expanded so there are two symmetrically sized slopes either side of the center point.

Previously `vmin` and `vmax` were clipped at the center point, which caused issues when displaying color bars.

This does not affect behaviour when `vmin` and `vmax` are manually specified by the user.

## Event objects emitted for `axes_leave_event`

`axes_leave_event` now emits a synthetic <span class="title-ref">.LocationEvent</span>, instead of reusing the last event object associated with a `motion_notify_event`.

## Streamplot now draws streamlines as one piece if no width or no color variance

Since there is no need to draw streamlines piece by piece if there is no color change or width change, now streamplot will draw each streamline in one piece.

The behavior for varying width or varying color is not changed, same logic is used for these kinds of streamplots.

## `canvas` argument now required for `FigureFrameWx`

`FigureFrameWx` now requires a keyword-only `canvas` argument when it is constructed.

## `ContourSet` is now a single Collection

Prior to this release, <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> (the object returned by <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.contour</span>) was a custom object holding multiple <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>s (and not an <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>) -- one collection per level, each connected component of that level's contour being an entry in the corresponding collection.

<span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> is now instead a plain <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> (and thus an <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>). The collection contains a single path per contour level; this path may be non-continuous in case there are multiple connected components.

Setting properties on the ContourSet can now usually be done using standard collection setters (`cset.set_linewidth(3)` to use the same linewidth everywhere or `cset.set_linewidth([1, 2, 3, ...])` to set different linewidths on each level) instead of having to go through the individual sub-components (`cset.collections[0].set_linewidth(...)`). Note that during the transition period, it remains possible to access the (deprecated) `.collections` attribute; this causes the ContourSet to modify itself to use the old-style multi-Collection representation.

## `SubFigure` default facecolor is now transparent

Subfigures default facecolor changed to `"none"`. Previously the default was the value of `figure.facecolor`.

## Reject size related keyword arguments to MovieWriter *grab\_frame* method

Although we pass <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span> keyword arguments through the <span class="title-ref">.AbstractMovieWriter.grab\_frame</span> some of the arguments will result in invalid output if passed. To be successfully stitched into a movie, each frame must be exactly the same size, thus *bbox\_inches* and *dpi* are excluded. Additionally, the movie writers are opinionated about the format of each frame, so the *format* argument is also excluded. Passing these arguments will now raise <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> for all writers (it already did so for some arguments and some writers). The *bbox\_inches* argument is already ignored (with a warning) if passed to <span class="title-ref">.Animation.save</span>.

Additionally, if `savefig.bbox` is set to `'tight'`, <span class="title-ref">.AbstractMovieWriter.grab\_frame</span> will now error. Previously this rcParam would be temporarily overridden (with a warning) in <span class="title-ref">.Animation.save</span>, it is now additionally overridden in <span class="title-ref">.AbstractMovieWriter.saving</span>.

## Changes of API after deprecation

  - <span class="title-ref">.dviread.find\_tex\_file</span> now raises <span class="title-ref">FileNotFoundError</span> when the requested filename is not found.
  - <span class="title-ref">.Figure.colorbar</span> now raises if *cax* is not given and it is unable to determine from which Axes to steal space, i.e. if *ax* is also not given and *mappable* has not been added to an Axes.
  - <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot2grid</span> no longer auto-remove preexisting overlapping Axes; explicitly call `Axes.remove` as needed.

## Invalid types for Annotation xycoords now raise TypeError

Previously, a <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span> would be raised in some cases.

## Default antialiasing behavior changes for `Text` and `Annotation`

`matplotlib.pyplot.annotate()` and `matplotlib.pyplot.text()` now support parameter *antialiased* when initializing. Examples:

`` `python     mpl.text.Text(.5, .5, "foo\nbar", antialiased=True)     plt.text(0.5, 0.5, '6 inches x 2 inches', antialiased=True)     ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5), antialiased=False)  See "What's New" for more details on usage.  With this new feature, you may want to make sure that you are creating and saving/showing the figure under the same context::      # previously this was a no-op, now it is what works     with rccontext(text.antialiased=False):         fig, ax = plt.subplots()         ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5))         fig.savefig('/tmp/test.png')      # previously this had an effect, now this is a no-op     fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5))     with rccontext(text.antialiased=False):         fig.savefig('/tmp/test.png')  Also note that antialiasing for tick labels will be set with :rc:`text.antialiased` when they are created (usually when a ``Figure``is created) - This means antialiasing for them can no longer be changed by modifying :rc:`text.antialiased`.``ScalarMappable.to\_rgba()`now respects the mask of RGB(A) arrays`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~ Previously, the mask was ignored. Now the alpha channel is set to 0 if any component (R, G, B, or A) is masked.

## `Text.get_rotation_mode` return value

Passing `None` as `rotation_mode` to <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> (the default value) or passing it to <span class="title-ref">.Text.set\_rotation\_mode</span> will make <span class="title-ref">.Text.get\_rotation\_mode</span> return `"default"` instead of `None`. The behaviour otherwise is the same.

## PostScript paper size adds option to use figure size

The `ps.papersize` rcParam can now be set to `'figure'`, which will use a paper size that corresponds exactly with the size of the figure that is being saved.

## `hexbin` *mincnt* parameter made consistently inclusive

Previously, *mincnt* was inclusive with no *C* provided but exclusive when *C* is provided. It is now inclusive of *mincnt* in both cases.

deprecations.md

# Deprecations

## Calling `paths.get_path_collection_extents` with empty *offsets*

Calling <span class="title-ref">\~.get\_path\_collection\_extents</span> with an empty *offsets* parameter has an ambiguous interpretation and is therefore deprecated. When the deprecation period expires, this will produce an error.

## `axes_grid1.axes_divider` API changes

The `AxesLocator` class is deprecated. The `new_locator` method of divider instances now instead returns an opaque callable (which can still be passed to `ax.set_axes_locator`).

`Divider.locate` is deprecated; use `Divider.new_locator(...)(ax, renderer)` instead.

## `bbox.anchored()` with no explicit container

Not passing a *container* argument to <span class="title-ref">.BboxBase.anchored</span> is now deprecated.

## Functions in `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d.proj3d`

The function `transform` is just an alias for `proj_transform`, use the latter instead.

The following functions are either unused (so no longer required in Matplotlib) or considered private. If you rely on them, please make a copy of the code, including all functions that starts with a `_` (considered private).

  - `ortho_transformation`
  - `persp_transformation`
  - `proj_points`
  - `proj_trans_points`
  - `rot_x`
  - `rotation_about_vector`
  - `view_transformation`

## Arguments other than `renderer` to `get_tightbbox`

... are keyword-only arguments. This is for consistency and that different classes have different additional arguments.

## The object returned by `pcolor()` has changed to a `PolyQuadMesh` class

The old object was a <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span> with flattened vertices and array data. The new <span class="title-ref">.PolyQuadMesh</span> class subclasses <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span>, but adds in better 2D coordinate and array handling in alignment with <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh</span>. Previously, if a masked array was input, the list of polygons within the collection would shrink to the size of valid polygons and users were required to keep track of which polygons were drawn and call `set_array()` with the smaller "compressed" array size. Passing the "compressed" and flattened array values is now deprecated and the full 2D array of values (including the mask) should be passed to <span class="title-ref">.PolyQuadMesh.set\_array</span>.

## `LocationEvent.lastevent`

... is deprecated with no replacement.

## `allsegs`, `allkinds`, `tcolors` and `tlinewidths` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span>

These attributes are deprecated; if required, directly retrieve the vertices and codes of the Path objects from `ContourSet.get_paths()` and the colors and the linewidths via `ContourSet.get_facecolor()`, `ContourSet.get_edgecolor()` and `ContourSet.get_linewidths()`.

## `ContourSet.collections`

... is deprecated. <span class="title-ref">.ContourSet</span> is now implemented as a single <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> of paths, each path corresponding to a contour level, possibly including multiple unconnected components.

During the deprecation period, accessing `ContourSet.collections` will revert the current ContourSet instance to the old object layout, with a separate <span class="title-ref">.PathCollection</span> per contour level.

## `INVALID_NON_AFFINE`, `INVALID_AFFINE`, `INVALID` attributes of `TransformNode`

These attributes are deprecated.

## `Grouper.clean()`

with no replacement. The Grouper class now cleans itself up automatically.

## `GridHelperCurveLinear.get_data_boundary`

... is deprecated. Use `grid_finder.extreme_finder(*[None] * 5)` to get the extremes of the grid.

## *np\_load* parameter of `cbook.get_sample_data`

This parameter is deprecated; <span class="title-ref">.get\_sample\_data</span> now auto-loads numpy arrays. Use `get_sample_data(..., asfileobj=False)` instead to get the filename of the data file, which can then be passed to <span class="title-ref">open</span>, if desired.

## `RendererAgg.tostring_rgb` and `FigureCanvasAgg.tostring_rgb`

... are deprecated with no direct replacement. Consider using `buffer_rgba` instead, which should cover most use cases.

## The parameter of `Annotation.contains` and `Legend.contains` is renamed to *mouseevent*

... consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.contains</span>.

## Accessing `event.guiEvent` after event handlers return

... is deprecated: for some GUI toolkits, it is unsafe to do so. In the future, `event.guiEvent` will be set to None once the event handlers return; you may separately stash the object at your own risk.

## Widgets

The *visible* attribute getter of Selector widgets has been deprecated; use `get_visible`

## Method parameters renamed to match base classes

The only parameter of `transform_affine` and `transform_non_affine` in `Transform` subclasses is renamed to *values*.

The *points* parameter of `transforms.IdentityTransform.transform` is renamed to *values*.

The *trans* parameter of `table.Cell.set_transform` is renamed to *t* consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_transform</span>.

The *clippath* parameters of `axis.Axis.set_clip_path` and `axis.Tick.set_clip_path` are renamed to *path* consistently with <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_clip\_path</span>.

The *s* parameter of `images.NonUniformImage.set_filternorm` is renamed to *filternorm* consistently with `_ImageBase.set_filternorm`.

The *s* parameter of `images.NonUniformImage.set_filterrad` is renamed to *filterrad* consistently with `_ImageBase.set_filterrad`.

## *numdecs* parameter and attribute of `LogLocator`

... are deprecated without replacement, because they have no effect.

## `NavigationToolbar2QT.message` is deprecated

... with no replacement.

## `ft2font.FT2Image.draw_rect` and `ft2font.FT2Font.get_xys`

... are deprecated as they are unused. If you rely on these, please let us know.

## `backend_ps.psDefs`

The `psDefs` module-level variable in `backend_ps` is deprecated with no replacement.

## Callable axisartist Axes

Calling an axisartist Axes to mean <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.axis</span> is deprecated; explicitly call the method instead.

## `AnchoredEllipse` is deprecated

Instead, directly construct an <span class="title-ref">.AnchoredOffsetbox</span>, an <span class="title-ref">.AuxTransformBox</span>, and an <span class="title-ref">\~.patches.Ellipse</span>, as demonstrated in \[/gallery/misc/anchored\_artists\](/gallery/misc/anchored\_artists.md).

## Automatic papersize selection in PostScript

Setting `ps.papersize` to `'auto'` or passing `papersize='auto'` to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig</span> is deprecated. Either pass an explicit paper type name, or omit this parameter to use the default from the rcParam.

## `Tick.set_label1` and `Tick.set_label2`

... are deprecated. Calling these methods from third-party code usually has no effect, as the labels are overwritten at draw time by the tick formatter.

## Passing extra positional arguments to `Figure.add_axes`

Positional arguments passed to <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_axes</span> other than a rect or an existing `Axes` are currently ignored, and doing so is now deprecated.

## `CbarAxesBase.toggle_label`

... is deprecated. Instead, use standard methods for manipulating colorbar labels (<span class="title-ref">.Colorbar.set\_label</span>) and tick labels (<span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span>).

## `TexManager.texcache`

... is considered private and deprecated. The location of the cache directory is clarified in the doc-string.

## Artists explicitly passed in will no longer be filtered by legend() based on their label

Currently, artists explicitly passed to `legend(handles=[...])` are filtered out if their label starts with an underscore. This behavior is deprecated; explicitly filter out such artists (`[art for art in artists if not art.get_label().startswith('_')]`) if necessary.

## `FigureCanvasBase.switch_backends`

... is deprecated with no replacement.

## `cbook.Stack` is deprecated

... with no replacement.

## `inset_location.InsetPosition` is deprecated

Use <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.inset\_axes</span> instead.

## `axisartist.axes_grid` and `axisartist.axes_rgb`

These modules, which provide wrappers combining the functionality of <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axisartist</span>, are deprecated; directly use e.g. `AxesGrid(..., axes_class=axislines.Axes)` instead.

## `ContourSet.antialiased`

... is deprecated; use <span class="title-ref">\~.Collection.get\_antialiased</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~.Collection.set\_antialiased</span> instead. Note that <span class="title-ref">\~.Collection.get\_antialiased</span> returns an array.

## Passing non-int or sequence of non-int to `Table.auto_set_column_width`

Column numbers are ints, and formerly passing any other type was effectively ignored. This will become an error in the future.

## `PdfPages(keep_empty=True)`

A zero-page pdf is not valid, thus passing `keep_empty=True` to <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> and <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span>, and the `keep_empty` attribute of these classes, are deprecated. Currently, these classes default to keeping empty outputs, but that behavior is deprecated too. Explicitly passing `keep_empty=False` remains supported for now to help transition to the new behavior.

Furthermore, <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> no longer immediately creates the target file upon instantiation, but only when the first figure is saved. To fully control file creation, directly pass an opened file object as argument (`with open(path, "wb") as file, PdfPages(file) as pdf: ...`).

## Auto-closing of figures when switching backend

... is deprecated. Explicitly call `plt.close("all")` if necessary. In the future, allowable backend switches (i.e. those that do not swap a GUI event loop with another one) will not close existing figures.

## Support for passing the "frac" key in `annotate(..., arrowprops={"frac": ...})`

... has been removed. This key has had no effect since Matplotlib 1.5.

# Development changes

## Increase to minimum supported versions of dependencies

For Matplotlib 3.8, the \[minimum supported versions \<dependencies\>\](\#minimum-supported-versions-\<dependencies\>) are being bumped:

</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy) and [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

## Increase to minimum supported optional dependencies

For Matplotlib 3.8, the \[minimum supported versions of optional dependencies \<optional\_dependencies\>\](\#minimum-supported-versions-of-optional-dependencies \<optional\_dependencies\>) are being bumped:

<table style="width:68%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 18%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>

<p>Qt</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>5.10</p>

<td><blockquote>
<p>5.12</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

  - There are no wheels or conda packages that support both Qt 5.11 (or older) and Python 3.9 (or newer).

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy)

## Provisional support for PEP484 Type Hint Annotations

New public API should be type hinted in `.pyi` stub files (except `pyplot` and tests which are typed in-line). Tests should be type hinted minimally, essentially only when `mypy` generates errors.

CI and configuration for running `mypy` have been added.

## Generation of `pyplot.py` requires `black`

The autogenerated portions of `pyplot.py` use `black` autoformatting to ensure syntax-correct, readable output code.

As such `black` is now a development and test requirement (for the test which regenerates `pyplot`).

## Wheels for some systems are no longer distributed

Pre-compiled wheels for 32-bit Linux and Windows are no longer provided on PyPI since Matplotlib 3.8.

Multi-architecture `universal2` wheels for macOS are no longer provided on PyPI since Matplotlib 3.8. In general, `pip` will always prefer the architecture-specific (`amd64`- or `arm64`-only) wheels, so these provided little benefit.

## New wheel architectures

Wheels have been added for:

  - musl based systems

removals.md

# Removals

## cbook removals

  - `matplotlib.cbook.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning` and `matplotlib.cbook.mplDeprecation` are removed; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span> instead.
  - `cbook.maxdict`; use the standard library `functools.lru_cache` instead.

## Groupers from `get_shared_x_axes` / `get_shared_y_axes` are immutable

Modifications to the Groupers returned by `get_shared_x_axes` and `get_shared_y_axes` are no longer allowed. Note that previously, calling e.g. `join()` would already fail to set up the correct structures for sharing axes; use <span class="title-ref">.Axes.sharex</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Axes.sharey</span> instead.

## Deprecated modules removed

The following deprecated modules are removed:

  - `afm`
  - `docstring`
  - `fontconfig_pattern`
  - `tight_bbox`
  - `tight_layout`
  - `type1font`

## Parameters to `plt.figure()` and the `Figure` constructor

All parameters to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.figure</span> and the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> constructor, other than *num*, *figsize*, and *dpi*, are now keyword-only.

## `stem(..., use_line_collection=False)`

... is no longer supported. This was a compatibility fallback to a former more inefficient representation of the stem lines.

## Positional / keyword arguments

Passing all but the very few first arguments positionally in the constructors of Artists is no longer possible. Most arguments are now keyword-only.

The *emit* and *auto* parameters of `set_xlim`, `set_ylim`, `set_zlim`, `set_rlim` are now keyword-only.

The *transOffset* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Collection.set\_offset\_transform</span> and the various `create_collection` methods of legend handlers has been renamed to *offset\_transform* (consistently with the property name).

`Axes.get_window_extent` / `Figure.get_window_extent` accept only *renderer*. This aligns the API with the general <span class="title-ref">.Artist.get\_window\_extent</span> API. All other parameters were ignored anyway.

## Methods to set parameters in `LogLocator` and `LogFormatter*`

In <span class="title-ref">\~.LogFormatter</span> and derived subclasses, the methods `base` and `label_minor` for setting the respective parameter are removed and replaced by `set_base` and `set_label_minor`, respectively.

In <span class="title-ref">\~.LogLocator</span>, the methods `base` and `subs` for setting the respective parameter are removed. Instead, use `set_params(base=..., subs=...)`.

## `Axes.get_renderer_cache`

The canvas now takes care of the renderer and whether to cache it or not, so the `Axes.get_renderer_cache` method is removed. The alternative is to call `axes.figure.canvas.get_renderer()`.

## Unused methods in `Axis`, `Tick`, `XAxis`, and `YAxis`

`Tick.label` is now removed. Use `Tick.label1` instead.

The following methods are no longer used and removed without a replacement:

  - `Axis.get_ticklabel_extents`
  - `Tick.get_pad_pixels`
  - `XAxis.get_text_heights`
  - `YAxis.get_text_widths`

## `mlab.stride_windows`

... is removed. Use `numpy.lib.stride_tricks.sliding_window_view` instead.

## `Axes3D`

The `dist` attribute has been privatized. Use the *zoom* keyword argument in <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.set\_box\_aspect</span> instead.

The `w_xaxis`, `w_yaxis`, and `w_zaxis` attributes are now removed. Instead use `xaxis`, `yaxis`, and `zaxis`.

## 3D Axis

`mplot3d.axis3d.Axis.set_pane_pos` is removed. This is an internal method where the provided values are overwritten during drawing. Hence, it does not serve any purpose to be directly accessible.

The two helper functions `mplot3d.axis3d.move_from_center` and `mplot3d.axis3d.tick_update_position` are considered internal and deprecated. If these are required, please vendor the code from the corresponding private methods `_move_from_center` and `_tick_update_position`.

## `checkdep_usetex` removed

This method was only intended to disable tests in case no latex install was found. As such, it is considered to be private and for internal use only.

Please vendor the code from a previous version if you need this.

## `date_ticker_factory` removed

The `date_ticker_factory` method in the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates</span> module is removed. Instead use <span class="title-ref">\~.AutoDateLocator</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.AutoDateFormatter</span> for a more flexible and scalable locator and formatter.

If you need the exact `date_ticker_factory` behavior, please copy the code from a previous version.

## `transforms.Affine2D.identity()`

... is removed in favor of directly calling the <span class="title-ref">.Affine2D</span> constructor with no arguments.

## Removals in `testing.decorators`

The unused class `CleanupTestCase` and decorator `cleanup` are removed. The function `check_freetype_version` is considered internal and removed. Vendor the code from a previous version.

## `text.get_rotation()`

... is removed with no replacement. Copy the previous implementation if needed. `Figure.callbacks` is removed \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

The Figure `callbacks` property has been removed. The only signal was "dpi\_changed", which can be replaced by connecting to the "resize\_event" on the canvas `figure.canvas.mpl_connect("resize_event", func)` instead.

## Passing too many positional arguments to `tripcolor`

... raises `TypeError` (extra arguments were previously ignored).

## The *filled* argument to `Colorbar` is removed

This behavior was already governed by the underlying `ScalarMappable`.

## Widgets

The *visible* attribute setter of Selector widgets has been removed; use `set_visible` The associated getter is also deprecated, but not yet expired.

## `Axes3D.set_frame_on` and `Axes3D.get_frame_on` removed

`Axes3D.set_frame_on` is documented as "Set whether the 3D axes panels are drawn.". However, it has no effect on 3D axes and is being removed in favor of `Axes3D.set_axis_on` and `Axes3D.set_axis_off`.

## Miscellaneous internals

  - `axes_grid1.axes_size.AddList`; use `sum(sizes, start=Fixed(0))` (for example) to sum multiple size objects.
  - `axes_size.Padded`; use `size + pad` instead
  - `axes_size.SizeFromFunc`, `axes_size.GetExtentHelper`
  - `AxisArtistHelper.delta1` and `AxisArtistHelper.delta2`
  - `axislines.GridHelperBase.new_gridlines` and `axislines.Axes.new_gridlines`
  - `_DummyAxis.dataLim` and `_DummyAxis.viewLim`; use `get_data_interval()`, `set_data_interval()`, `get_view_interval()`, and `set_view_interval()` instead.
  - `ImageMagickBase.delay` and `ImageMagickBase.output_args`
  - `MathtextBackend`, `MathtextBackendAgg`, `MathtextBackendPath`, `MathTextWarning`
  - `TexManager.get_font_config`; it previously returned an internal hashed key for used for caching purposes.
  - `TextToPath.get_texmanager`; directly construct a <span class="title-ref">.texmanager.TexManager</span> instead.
  - `ticker.is_close_to_int`; use `math.isclose(x, round(x))` instead.
  - `ticker.is_decade`; use `y = numpy.log(x)/numpy.log(base); numpy.isclose(y, numpy.round(y))` instead.

## Backend-specific removals

  - `backend_pdf.Name.hexify`
  - `backend_pdf.Operator` and `backend_pdf.Op.op` are removed in favor of a single standard <span class="title-ref">enum.Enum</span> interface on <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.Op</span>.
  - `backend_pdf.fill`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on these functions.
  - `backend_pgf.LatexManager.texcommand` and `backend_pgf.LatexManager.latex_header`
  - `backend_pgf.NO_ESCAPE`
  - `backend_pgf.common_texification`
  - `backend_pgf.get_fontspec`
  - `backend_pgf.get_preamble`
  - `backend_pgf.re_mathsep`
  - `backend_pgf.writeln`
  - `backend_ps.convert_psfrags`
  - `backend_ps.quote_ps_string`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.escape_attrib`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.escape_cdata`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.escape_comment`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.short_float_fmt`; vendor the code of the similarly named private functions if you rely on it.
  - `backend_svg.generate_transform` and `backend_svg.generate_css`

## Removal of deprecated APIs

The following deprecated APIs have been removed. Unless a replacement is stated, please vendor the previous implementation if needed.

  - The following methods of \`.FigureCanvasBase\`: `pick` (use `Figure.pick` instead), `resize`, `draw_event`, `resize_event`, `close_event`, `key_press_event`, `key_release_event`, `pick_event`, `scroll_event`, `button_press_event`, `button_release_event`, `motion_notify_event`, `leave_notify_event`, `enter_notify_event` (for all the `foo_event` methods, construct the relevant <span class="title-ref">.Event</span> object and call `canvas.callbacks.process(event.name, event)` instead).
  - `ToolBase.destroy` (connect to `tool_removed_event` instead).
  - The *cleared* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasAgg.get\_renderer</span> (call `renderer.clear()` instead).
  - The following methods of \`.RendererCairo\`: `set_ctx_from_surface` and `set_width_height` (use `set_context` instead, which automatically infers the canvas size).
  - The `window` or `win` parameters and/or attributes of `NavigationToolbar2Tk`, `NavigationToolbar2GTK3`, and `NavigationToolbar2GTK4`, and the `lastrect` attribute of `NavigationToolbar2Tk`
  - The `error_msg_gtk` function and the `icon_filename` and `window_icon` globals in `backend_gtk3`; the `error_msg_wx` function in `backend_wx`.
  - `FigureManagerGTK3Agg` and `FigureManagerGTK4Agg` (use `FigureManagerGTK3` instead); `RendererGTK3Cairo` and `RendererGTK4Cairo`.
  - `NavigationToolbar2Mac.prepare_configure_subplots` (use <span class="title-ref">\~.NavigationToolbar2.configure\_subplots</span> instead).
  - `FigureManagerMac.close`.
  - The `qApp` global in <span class="title-ref">.backend\_qt</span> (use `QtWidgets.QApplication.instance()` instead).
  - The `offset_text_height` method of `RendererWx`; the `sizer`, `figmgr`, `num`, `toolbar`, `toolmanager`, `get_canvas`, and `get_figure_manager` attributes or methods of `FigureFrameWx` (use `frame.GetSizer()`, `frame.canvas.manager`, `frame.canvas.manager.num`, `frame.GetToolBar()`, `frame.canvas.manager.toolmanager`, the *canvas\_class* constructor parameter, and `frame.canvas.manager`, respectively, instead).
  - `FigureFrameWxAgg` and `FigureFrameWxCairo` (use `FigureFrameWx(..., canvas_class=FigureCanvasWxAgg)` and `FigureFrameWx(..., canvas_class=FigureCanvasWxCairo)`, respectively, instead).
  - The `filled` attribute and the `draw_all` method of <span class="title-ref">.Colorbar</span> (instead of `draw_all`, use `figure.draw_without_rendering`).
  - Calling <span class="title-ref">.MarkerStyle</span> without setting the *marker* parameter or setting it to None (use `MarkerStyle("")` instead).
  - Support for third-party canvas classes without a `required_interactive_framework` attribute (this can only occur if the canvas class does not inherit from <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase</span>).
  - The `canvas` and `background` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.MultiCursor</span>; the `state_modifier_keys` attribute of selector widgets.
  - Passing *useblit*, *horizOn*, or *vertOn* positionally to <span class="title-ref">.MultiCursor</span>.
  - Support for the `seaborn-<foo>` styles; use `seaborn-v0_8-<foo>` instead, or directly use the seaborn API.

# API Changes for 3.8.1

## Behaviour

### Default behaviour of `hexbin` with *C* provided requires at least 1 point

The behaviour changed in 3.8.0 to be inclusive of *mincnt*. However, that resulted in errors or warnings with some reduction functions, so now the default is to require at least 1 point to call the reduction function. This effectively restores the default behaviour to match that of Matplotlib 3.7 and before.

## Deprecations

### Deprecations removed in `contour`

`contour.allsegs`, `contour.allkinds`, and `contour.find_nearest_contour` are no longer marked for deprecation.

## Development

### Minimum version of setuptools bumped to 64

To comply with requirements of `setuptools_scm`, the minimum version of `setuptools` has been increased from 42 to 64.

# Behaviour Changes

## plot() shorthand format interprets "Cn" (n\>9) as a color-cycle color

Previously, `plot(..., "-C11")` would be interpreted as requesting a plot using linestyle "-", color "C1" (color \#1 of the color cycle), and marker "1" ("tri-down"). It is now interpreted as requesting linestyle "-" and color "C11" (color \#11 of the color cycle).

It is recommended to pass ambiguous markers (such as "1") explicitly using the *marker* keyword argument. If the shorthand form is desired, such markers can also be unambiguously set by putting them *before* the color string.

## Legend labels for `plot`

Previously if a sequence was passed to the *label* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> when plotting a single dataset, the sequence was automatically cast to string for the legend label. Now, if the sequence has only one element, that element will be the legend label. To keep the old behavior, cast the sequence to string before passing.

## Boxplots now ignore masked data points

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.boxplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span> now ignore any masked points in the input data.

## `axhspan` and `axvspan` now return `Rectangle`s, not `Polygon`s

This change allows using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axhspan</span> to draw an annulus on polar axes.

This change also affects other elements built via <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axhspan</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axvspan</span>, such as `Slider.poly`.

## Improved handling of pan/zoom events of overlapping Axes

The forwarding of pan/zoom events is now determined by the visibility of the background-patch (e.g. `ax.patch.get_visible()`) and by the `zorder` of the axes.

  - Axes with a visible patch capture the event and do not pass it on to axes below. Only the Axes with the highest `zorder` that contains the event is triggered (if there are multiple Axes with the same `zorder`, the last added Axes counts)
  - Axes with an invisible patch are also invisible to events and they are passed on to the axes below.

To override the default behavior and explicitly set whether an Axes should forward navigation events, use <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_forward\_navigation\_events</span>.

## `loc='best'` for `legend` now considers `Text` and `PolyCollections`

The location selection `legend` now considers the existence of `Text` and `PolyCollections` in the `badness` calculation.

Note: The `best` option can already be quite slow for plots with large amounts of data. For `PolyCollections`, it only considers the `Path` of `PolyCollections` and not the enclosed area when checking for overlap to reduce additional latency. However, it can still be quite slow when there are large amounts of `PolyCollections` in the plot to check for.

## Exception when not passing a Bbox to BboxTransform\*-classes

The exception when not passing a Bbox to BboxTransform\*-classes that expect one, e.g., <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.BboxTransform</span> has changed from `ValueError` to `TypeError`.

## *loc* parameter of `Cell` no longer accepts `None`

The default value of the *loc* parameter has been changed from `None` to `right`, which already was the default location. The behavior of <span class="title-ref">.Cell</span> didn't change when called without an explicit *loc* parameter.

## `ContourLabeler.add_label` now respects *use\_clabeltext*

... and sets <span class="title-ref">.Text.set\_transform\_rotates\_text</span> accordingly.

## `Line2D`

When creating a Line2D or using <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_xdata</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_ydata</span>, passing x/y data as non sequence is now an error.

## `ScalarMappable`s auto-scale their norm when an array is set

Collections previously deferred auto-scaling of the norm until draw time. This has been changed to scale the norm whenever the first array is set to align with the docstring and reduce unexpected behavior when accessing the norm before drawing.

## `SubplotParams` moved from `matplotlib.figure` to `matplotlib.gridspec`

It is still importable from `matplotlib.figure`, so does not require any changes to existing code.

## `PowerNorm` no longer clips values below vmin

When `clip=False` is set (the default) on <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.PowerNorm</span>, values below `vmin` are now linearly normalised. Previously they were clipped to zero. This fixes issues with the display of colorbars associated with a power norm.

## Image path semantics of toolmanager-based tools

Previously, MEP22 ("toolmanager-based") Tools would try to load their icon (`tool.image`) relative to the current working directory, or, as a fallback, from Matplotlib's own image directory. Because both approaches are problematic for third-party tools (the end-user may change the current working directory at any time, and third-parties cannot add new icons in Matplotlib's image directory), this behavior is deprecated; instead, `tool.image` is now interpreted relative to the directory containing the source file where the `Tool.image` class attribute is defined. (Defining `tool.image` as an absolute path also works and is compatible with both the old and the new semantics.)

deprecations.md

---

# Deprecations

## `plot_date`

Use of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot\_date</span> has been discouraged since Matplotlib 3.5 and the function is now formally deprecated.

  - `datetime`-like data should directly be plotted using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span>.
  - If you need to plot plain numeric data as \[date-format\](\#date-format) or need to set a timezone, call `ax.xaxis.axis_date` / `ax.yaxis.axis_date` before <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span>. See <span class="title-ref">.Axis.axis\_date</span>.

## Legend labels for `plot`

Previously if a sequence was passed to the *label* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> when plotting a single dataset, the sequence was automatically cast to string for the legend label. This behavior is now deprecated and in future will error if the sequence length is not one (consistent with multi-dataset behavior, where the number of elements must match the number of datasets). To keep the old behavior, cast the sequence to string before passing.

## `boxplot` tick labels

The parameter *labels* has been renamed to *tick\_labels* for clarity and consistency with <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span>.

## Mixing positional and keyword arguments for `legend` handles and labels

This previously only raised a warning, but is now formally deprecated. If passing *handles* and *labels*, they must be passed either both positionally or both as keyword.

## Applying theta transforms in `PolarTransform`

Applying theta transforms in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarTransform</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.InvertedPolarTransform</span> is deprecated, and will be removed in a future version of Matplotlib. This is currently the default behaviour when these transforms are used externally, but only takes affect when:

  - An axis is associated with the transform.
  - The axis has a non-zero theta offset or has theta values increasing in a clockwise direction.

To silence this warning and adopt future behaviour, set `apply_theta_transforms=False`. If you need to retain the behaviour where theta values are transformed, chain the `PolarTransform` with a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Affine2D</span> transform that performs the theta shift and/or sign shift.

## *interval* parameter of `TimerBase.start`

Setting the timer *interval* while starting it is deprecated. The interval can be specified instead in the timer constructor, or by setting the `timer.interval` attribute.

## *nth\_coord* parameter to axisartist helpers for fixed axis

Helper APIs in <span class="title-ref">.axisartist</span> for generating a "fixed" axis on rectilinear axes (<span class="title-ref">.FixedAxisArtistHelperRectilinear</span>) no longer take a *nth\_coord* parameter, as that parameter is entirely inferred from the (required) *loc* parameter and having inconsistent *nth\_coord* and *loc* is an error.

For curvilinear axes, the *nth\_coord* parameter remains supported (it affects the *ticks*, not the axis position itself), but that parameter will become keyword-only, for consistency with the rectilinear case.

## `rcsetup.interactive_bk`, `rcsetup.non_interactive_bk` and `rcsetup.all_backends`

... are deprecated and replaced by `matplotlib.backends.backend_registry.list_builtin` with the following arguments

  - `matplotlib.backends.BackendFilter.INTERACTIVE`
  - `matplotlib.backends.BackendFilter.NON_INTERACTIVE`
  - `None`

respectively.

## Miscellaneous deprecations

  - `backend_ps.get_bbox_header` is considered an internal helper
  - `BboxTransformToMaxOnly`; if you rely on this, please make a copy of the code
  - `ContourLabeler.add_label_clabeltext`
  - `TransformNode.is_bbox`; instead check the object using `isinstance(..., BboxBase)`
  - `GridHelperCurveLinear.get_tick_iterator`

# Development changes

## Build system ported to Meson

The build system of Matplotlib has been ported from setuptools to [meson-python](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io) and [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com). Consequently, there have been a few changes for development and packaging purposes.

1.  Installation by `pip` of packages with `pyproject.toml` use [build isolation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/build-system/pyproject-toml/#build-isolation) by default, which interferes with editable installation. Thus for developers using editable installs, it is now necessary to pass the `--no-build-isolation` flag to `pip install`. This means that all build-time requirements must be available in the environment for an editable install.

2.  Build configuration has moved from a custom `mplsetup.cfg` (also configurable via `MPLSETUP` environment variable) to Meson options. These may be specified using [meson-python's build config settings](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to-guides/config-settings.html) for `setup-args`. See `meson_options.txt` for all options. For example, a `mplsetup.cfg` containing the following:
    
        [rc_options]
        backend=Agg
        
        [libs]
        system_qhull = True
    
    may be replaced by passing the following arguments to `pip`:
    
        --config-settings=setup-args="-DrcParams-backend=Agg"
        --config-settings=setup-args="-Dsystem-qhull=true"
    
    Note that you must use `pip` \>= 23.1 in order to pass more than one setting.

3.  Relatedly, Meson's [builtin options](https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html) are now used instead of custom options, e.g., the LTO option is now `b_lto`.

4.  On Windows, Meson activates a Visual Studio environment automatically. However, it will not do so if another compiler is available. See [Meson's documentation](https://mesonbuild.com/Builtin-options.html#details-for-vsenv) if you wish to change the priority of chosen compilers.

5.  Installation of test data was previously controlled by `mplsetup.cfg`, but has now been moved to Meson's install tags. To install test data, add the `tests` tag to the requested install (be sure to include the existing tags as below):
    
        --config-settings=install-args="--tags=data,python-runtime,runtime,tests"

6.  Checking typing stubs with `stubtest` does not work easily with editable install. For the time being, we suggest using a normal (non-editable) install if you wish to run `stubtest`.

## Increase to minimum supported versions of dependencies

For Matplotlib 3.9, the \[minimum supported versions \<dependencies\>\](\#minimum-supported-versions-\<dependencies\>) are being bumped:

<table style="width:68%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 18%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
<col style="width: 25%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Dependency</th>
<th>min in mpl3.8</th>
<th>min in mpl3.9</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><blockquote>
<p>NumPy</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>1.21.0</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>1.23.0</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td>setuptools</td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>42</p>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<p>64</p>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

This is consistent with our \[min\_deps\_policy\](\#min\_deps\_policy) and [SPEC 0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).

To comply with requirements of `setuptools_scm`, the minimum version of `setuptools` has been increased from 42 to 64.

## Extensions require C++17

Matplotlib now requires a compiler that supports C++17 in order to build its extensions. According to [SciPy's analysis](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/dev/toolchain.html#c-language-standards), this should be available on all supported platforms.

## Windows on ARM64 support

Windows on ARM64 now bundles FreeType 2.6.1 instead of 2.11.1 when building from source. This may cause small changes to text rendering, but should become consistent with all other platforms.

# Removals

## Top-level cmap registration and access functions in `mpl.cm`

As part of the [multi-step refactoring of colormap registration](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20853), the following functions have been removed:

  - `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`; use `matplotlib.colormaps[name]` instead if you have a <span class="title-ref">str</span>.
    
    Use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ColormapRegistry.get\_cmap</span> if you have a <span class="title-ref">str</span>, <span class="title-ref">None</span> or a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> object that you want to convert to a <span class="title-ref">.Colormap</span> object.

  - `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead.

  - `matplotlib.cm.unregister_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.unregister \<.ColormapRegistry.unregister\></span> instead.

  - `matplotlib.pyplot.register_cmap`; use <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps.register \<.ColormapRegistry.register\></span> instead.

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.get\_cmap</span> function will stay available for backward compatibility.

## Contour labels

`contour.ClabelText` and `ContourLabeler.set_label_props` are removed. Use `Text(..., transform_rotates_text=True)` as a replacement for `contour.ClabelText(...)` and `text.set(text=text, color=color, fontproperties=labeler.labelFontProps, clip_box=labeler.axes.bbox)` as a replacement for the `ContourLabeler.set_label_props(label, text, color)`.

The `labelFontProps`, `labelFontSizeList`, and `labelTextsList` attributes of <span class="title-ref">.ContourLabeler</span> have been removed. Use the `labelTexts` attribute and the font properties of the corresponding text objects instead.

## `num2julian`, `julian2num` and `JULIAN_OFFSET`

... of the <span class="title-ref">.dates</span> module are removed without replacements. These were undocumented and not exported.

Julian dates in Matplotlib were calculated from a Julian date epoch: `jdate = (date - np.datetime64(EPOCH)) / np.timedelta64(1, 'D')`. Conversely, a Julian date was converted to datetime as `date = np.timedelta64(int(jdate * 24 * 3600), 's') + np.datetime64(EPOCH)`. Matplotlib was using `EPOCH='-4713-11-24T12:00'` so that 2000-01-01 at 12:00 is 2\_451\_545.0 (see <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Julian_day>).

## `offsetbox` methods

`offsetbox.bbox_artist` is removed. This was just a wrapper to call <span class="title-ref">.patches.bbox\_artist</span> if a flag is set in the file, so use that directly if you need the behavior.

`OffsetBox.get_extent_offsets` and `OffsetBox.get_extent` are removed; these methods are also removed on all subclasses of <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span>. To get the offsetbox extents, instead of `get_extent`, use <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox.get\_bbox</span>, which directly returns a <span class="title-ref">.Bbox</span> instance. To also get the child offsets, instead of `get_extent_offsets`, separately call <span class="title-ref">\~.OffsetBox.get\_offset</span> on each children after triggering a draw.

## `parse_fontconfig_pattern` raises on unknown constant names

Previously, in a fontconfig pattern like `DejaVu Sans:foo`, the unknown `foo` constant name would be silently ignored. This now raises an error.

## `tri` submodules

The `matplotlib.tri.*` submodules are removed. All functionality is available in `matplotlib.tri` directly and should be imported from there.

## Widget API

  - `CheckButtons.rectangles` and `CheckButtons.lines` are removed; <span class="title-ref">.CheckButtons</span> now draws itself using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>.
  - `RadioButtons.circles` is removed; <span class="title-ref">.RadioButtons</span> now draws itself using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>.
  - `MultiCursor.needclear` is removed with no replacement.
  - The unused parameter *x* to `TextBox.begin_typing` was a required argument, and is now removed.

### Most arguments to widgets have been made keyword-only

Passing all but the very few first arguments positionally in the constructors of Widgets is now keyword-only. In general, all optional arguments are keyword-only.

## `Axes3D` API

  - `Axes3D.unit_cube`, `Axes3D.tunit_cube`, and `Axes3D.tunit_edges` are removed without replacement.
  - `axes3d.vvec`, `axes3d.eye`, `axes3d.sx`, and `axes3d.sy` are removed without replacement.

## Inconsistent *nth\_coord* and *loc* passed to `_FixedAxisArtistHelperBase`

The value of the *nth\_coord* parameter of `_FixedAxisArtistHelperBase` and its subclasses is now inferred from the value of *loc*; passing inconsistent values (e.g., requesting a "top y axis" or a "left x axis") has no more effect.

## Passing undefined *label\_mode* to `Grid`

... is no longer allowed. This includes <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.Grid</span>, <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.AxesGrid</span>, and <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span> as well as the corresponding classes imported from `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.axes_grid`.

Pass `label_mode='keep'` instead to get the previous behavior of not modifying labels.

## `draw_gouraud_triangle`

... is removed. Use <span class="title-ref">\~.RendererBase.draw\_gouraud\_triangles</span> instead.

A `draw_gouraud_triangle` call in a custom <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.artist.Artist</span> can readily be replaced as:

    self.draw_gouraud_triangles(gc, points.reshape((1, 3, 2)),
                                colors.reshape((1, 3, 4)), trans)

A <span class="title-ref">\~.RendererBase.draw\_gouraud\_triangles</span> method can be implemented from an existing `draw_gouraud_triangle` method as:

    transform = transform.frozen()
    for tri, col in zip(triangles_array, colors_array):
        self.draw_gouraud_triangle(gc, tri, col, transform)

## Miscellaneous removals

The following items have previously been replaced, and are now removed:

  - *ticklabels* parameter of `matplotlib.axis.Axis.set_ticklabels` has been renamed to *labels*.
  - `Barbs.barbs_doc` and `Quiver.quiver_doc` are removed. These are the doc-strings and should not be accessible as a named class member, but as normal doc-strings would.
  - `collections.PolyCollection.span_where` and `collections.BrokenBarHCollection`; use `fill_between` instead.
  - `Legend.legendHandles` was undocumented and has been renamed to `legend_handles`.

The following items have been removed without replacements:

  - The attributes `repeat` of <span class="title-ref">.TimedAnimation</span> and subclasses and `save_count` of <span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> are considered private and removed.
  - `matplotlib.backend.backend_agg.BufferRegion.to_string`
  - `matplotlib.backend.backend_agg.BufferRegion.to_string_argb`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_ps.PsBackendHelper`
  - `matplotlib.backends.backend_webagg.ServerThread`
  - *raw* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.GridSpecBase.get\_grid\_positions</span>
  - `matplotlib.patches.ConnectionStyle._Base.SimpleEvent`
  - `passthru_pt` attribute of `mpl_toolkits.axisartist.AxisArtistHelper`

### Documentation-specific custom Sphinx roles are now semi-public

For third-party packages that derive types from Matplotlib, our use of custom roles may prevent Sphinx from building their docs. These custom Sphinx roles are now public solely for the purposes of use within projects that derive from Matplotlib types. See `matplotlib.sphinxext.roles` for details.

# API Changes for 3.9.2

## Development

### Windows wheel runtime bundling made static

In 3.7.0, the MSVC runtime DLL was bundled in wheels to enable importing Matplotlib on systems that do not have it installed. However, this could cause inconsistencies with other wheels that did the same, and trigger random crashes depending on import order. See [this issue](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/28551) for further details.

Since 3.9.2, wheels now bundle the MSVC runtime DLL statically to avoid such issues.

`mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1` provides a framework of helper classes to adjust the positioning of multiple fixed-aspect Axes (e.g., displaying images). It can be contrasted with the `aspect` property of Matplotlib Axes, which adjusts the position of a single Axes.

See \[axes\_grid1\_users-guide-index\](\#axes\_grid1\_users-guide-index) for a guide on the usage of axes\_grid1.

# mplot3d FAQ

## How is mplot3d different from Mayavi?

[Mayavi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/) is a very powerful and featureful 3D graphing library. For advanced 3D scenes and excellent rendering capabilities, it is highly recommended to use Mayavi.

mplot3d was intended to allow users to create simple 3D graphs with the same "look-and-feel" as matplotlib's 2D plots. Furthermore, users can use the same toolkit that they are already familiar with to generate both their 2D and 3D plots.

## My 3D plot doesn't look right at certain viewing angles

This is probably the most commonly reported issue with mplot3d. The problem is that -- from some viewing angles -- a 3D object would appear in front of another object, even though it is physically behind it. This can result in plots that do not look "physically correct."

Unfortunately, while some work is being done to reduce the occurrence of this artifact, it is currently an intractable problem, and cannot be fully solved until matplotlib supports 3D graphics rendering at its core.

The problem occurs due to the reduction of 3D data down to 2D + z-order scalar. A single value represents the 3rd dimension for all parts of 3D objects in a collection. Therefore, when the bounding boxes of two collections intersect, it becomes possible for this artifact to occur. Furthermore, the intersection of two 3D objects (such as polygons or patches) cannot be rendered properly in matplotlib's 2D rendering engine.

This problem will likely not be solved until OpenGL support is added to all of the backends (patches are greatly welcomed). Until then, if you need complex 3D scenes, we recommend using [MayaVi](https://docs.enthought.com/mayavi/mayavi/).

## I don't like how the 3D plot is laid out, how do I change that?

Historically, mplot3d has suffered from a hard-coding of parameters used to control visuals such as label spacing, tick length, and grid line width. Work is being done to eliminate this issue. For matplotlib v1.1.0, there is a semi-official manner to modify these parameters. See the note in the `.mplot3d.axis3d` section of the mplot3d API documentation for more information.

# mplot3d View Angles

## How to define the view angle

The position of the viewport "camera" in a 3D plot is defined by three angles: *elevation*, *azimuth*, and *roll*. From the resulting position, it always points towards the center of the plot box volume. The angle direction is a common convention, and is shared with [PyVista](https://docs.pyvista.org/api/core/camera.html) and [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/view.html). Note that a positive roll angle rotates the viewing plane clockwise, so the 3d axes will appear to rotate counter-clockwise.

![image](/_static/mplot3d_view_angles.png)

Rotating the plot using the mouse will control azimuth, elevation, as well as roll, and all three angles can be set programmatically:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    ax = plt.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')
    ax.view_init(elev=30, azim=45, roll=15)

## Primary view planes

To look directly at the primary view planes, the required elevation, azimuth, and roll angles are shown in the diagram of an "unfolded" plot below. These are further documented in the <span class="title-ref">.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.view\_init</span> API.

<div class="plot" data-align="center">

gallery/mplot3d/view\_planes\_3d.py

</div>

## Rotation with mouse

3D plots can be reoriented by dragging the mouse. There are various ways to accomplish this; the style of mouse rotation can be specified by setting `axes3d.mouserotationstyle`, see \[/users/explain/customizing\](/users/explain/customizing.md).

Prior to v3.10, the 2D mouse position corresponded directly to azimuth and elevation; this is also how it is done in [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/view.html). To keep it this way, set `mouserotationstyle: azel`. This approach works fine for spherical coordinate plots, where the *z* axis is special; however, it leads to a kind of 'gimbal lock' when looking down the *z* axis: the plot reacts differently to mouse movement, dependent on the particular orientation at hand. Also, 'roll' cannot be controlled.

As an alternative, there are various mouse rotation styles where the mouse manipulates a virtual 'trackball'. In its simplest form (`mouserotationstyle: trackball`), the trackball rotates around an in-plane axis perpendicular to the mouse motion (it is as if there is a plate laying on the trackball; the plate itself is fixed in orientation, but you can drag the plate with the mouse, thus rotating the ball). This is more natural to work with than the `azel` style; however, the plot cannot be easily rotated around the viewing direction - one has to move the mouse in circles with a handedness opposite to the desired rotation, counterintuitively.

A different variety of trackball rotates along the shortest arc on the virtual sphere (`mouserotationstyle: sphere`). Rotating around the viewing direction is straightforward with it: grab the ball near its edge instead of near the center.

Ken Shoemake's ARCBALL [\[Shoemake1992\]](#Shoemake1992) is also available (`mouserotationstyle: Shoemake`); it resembles the `sphere` style, but is free of hysteresis, i.e., returning mouse to the original position returns the figure to its original orientation; the rotation is independent of the details of the path the mouse took, which could be desirable. However, Shoemake's arcball rotates at twice the angular rate of the mouse movement (it is quite noticeable, especially when adjusting roll), and it lacks an obvious mechanical equivalent; arguably, the path-independent rotation is not natural (however convenient), it could take some getting used to. So it is a trade-off.

Henriksen et al. [\[Henriksen2002\]](#Henriksen2002) provide an overview. In summary:

|           |                  |                 |              |                       |                             |

You can try out one of the various mouse rotation styles using:

    import matplotlib as mpl
    mpl.rcParams['axes3d.mouserotationstyle'] = 'trackball'  # 'azel', 'trackball', 'sphere', or 'arcball'
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib import cm
    
    ax = plt.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')
    
    X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
    R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
    Z = np.sin(R)
    
    surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap=cm.coolwarm,
                           linewidth=0, antialiased=False)
    
    plt.show()

Alternatively, create a file `matplotlibrc`, with contents:

    axes3d.mouserotationstyle: trackball

(or any of the other styles, instead of `trackball`), and then run any of the \[mplot3d-examples-index\](\#mplot3d-examples-index) examples.

The size of the virtual trackball, sphere, or arcball can be adjusted by setting `axes3d.trackballsize`. This specifies how much mouse motion is needed to obtain a given rotation angle (when near the center), and it controls where the edge of the sphere or arcball is (how far from the center, hence how close to the plot edge). The size is specified in units of the Axes bounding box, i.e., to make the arcball span the whole bounding box, set it to 1. A size of about 2/3 appears to work reasonably well; this is the default.

Both arcballs (`mouserotationstyle: sphere` and `mouserotationstyle: arcball`) have a noticeable edge; the edge can be made less abrupt by specifying a border width, `axes3d.trackballborder`. This works somewhat like Gavin Bell's arcball, which was originally written for OpenGL [\[Bell1988\]](#Bell1988), and is used in Blender and Meshlab. Bell's arcball extends the arcball's spherical control surface with a hyperbola; the two are smoothly joined. However, the hyperbola extends all the way beyond the edge of the plot. In the mplot3d sphere and arcball style, the border extends to a radius `trackballsize/2 + trackballborder`. Beyond the border, the style works like the original: it controls roll only. A border width of about 0.2 appears to work well; this is the default. To obtain the original Shoemake's arcball with a sharp border, set the border width to 0. For an extended border similar to Bell's arcball, where the transition from the arcball to the border occurs at 45°, set the border width to \(\sqrt 2 \approx 1.414\). The border is a circular arc, wrapped around the arcball sphere cylindrically (like a doughnut), joined smoothly to the sphere, much like Bell's hyperbola.

1.  The way it was prior to v3.10; this is also MATLAB's style

2.  Mouse controls roll too (not only azimuth and elevation)

3.  Figure reacts the same way to mouse movements, regardless of orientation (no difference between 'poles' and 'equator')

4.  Returning mouse to original position returns figure to original orientation (rotation is independent of the details of the path the mouse took)

5.  The style has a corresponding natural implementation as a mechanical device

6.  While it is possible to control roll with the `trackball` style, this is not immediately obvious (it requires moving the mouse in large circles) and a bit counterintuitive (the resulting roll is in the opposite direction)

# `mpl_toolkits.mplot3d`

The mplot3d toolkit adds simple 3D plotting capabilities (scatter, surface, line, mesh, etc.) to Matplotlib by supplying an Axes object that can create a 2D projection of a 3D scene. The resulting graph will have the same look and feel as regular 2D plots. Not the fastest or most feature complete 3D library out there, but it ships with Matplotlib and thus may be a lighter weight solution for some use cases.

See the \[mplot3d tutorial \<mplot3d\>\](\#mplot3d-tutorial-\<mplot3d\>) for more information.

![image](/_static/demo_mplot3d.png)

The interactive backends also provide the ability to rotate and zoom the 3D scene. One can rotate the 3D scene by simply clicking-and-dragging the scene. Panning is done by clicking the middle mouse button, and zooming is done by right-clicking the scene and dragging the mouse up and down. Unlike 2D plots, the toolbar pan and zoom buttons are not used.

# MEP8: PEP8

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Superseded**

Current guidelines for style, including usage of pep8 are maintained in [our pull request guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/coding_guide.html).

We are currently enforcing a sub-set of pep8 on new code contributions.

## Branches and Pull requests

None so far.

## Abstract

The matplotlib codebase predates PEP8, and therefore is less than consistent style-wise in some areas. Bringing the codebase into compliance with PEP8 would go a long way to improving its legibility.

## Detailed description

Some files use four space indentation, some use three. Some use different levels in the same file.

For the most part, class/function/variable naming follows PEP8, but it wouldn't hurt to fix where necessary.

## Implementation

The implementation should be fairly mechanical: running the pep8 tool over the code and fixing where appropriate.

This should be merged in after the 2.0 release, since the changes will likely make merging any pending pull requests more difficult.

Additionally, and optionally, PEP8 compliance could be tracked by an automated build system.

## Backward compatibility

Public names of classes and functions that require change (there shouldn't be many of these) should first be deprecated and then removed in the next release cycle.

## Alternatives

PEP8 is a popular standard for Python code style, blessed by the Python core developers, making any alternatives less desirable.

# MEP9: Global interaction manager

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

Add a global manager for all user interactivity with artists; make any artist resizeable, moveable, highlightable, and selectable as desired by the user.

## Status

**Discussion**

## Branches and Pull requests

<https://github.com/dhyams/matplotlib/tree/MEP9>

## Abstract

The goal is to be able to interact with matplotlib artists in a very similar way as drawing programs do. When appropriate, the user should be able to move, resize, or select an artist that is already on the canvas. Of course, the script writer is ultimately in control of whether an artist is able to be interacted with, or whether it is static.

This code to do this has already been privately implemented and tested, and would need to be migrated from its current "mixin" implementation, to a bona-fide part of matplotlib.

The end result would be to have four new keywords available to matplotlib.artist.Artist: \_[moveable](), \_[resizeable](), \_[selectable](), and \_[highlightable](). Setting any one of these keywords to True would activate interactivity for that artist.

In effect, this MEP is a logical extension of event handling in matplotlib; matplotlib already supports "low level" interactions like left mouse presses, a key press, or similar. The MEP extends the support to the logical level, where callbacks are performed on the artists when certain interactive gestures from the user are detected.

## Detailed description

This new functionality would be used to allow the end-user to better interact with the graph. Many times, a graph is almost what the user wants, but a small repositioning and/or resizing of components is necessary. Rather than force the user to go back to the script to trial-and-error the location, and simple drag and drop would be appropriate.

Also, this would better support applications that use matplotlib; here, the end-user has no reasonable access or desire to edit the underlying source in order to fine-tune a plot. Here, if matplotlib offered the capability, one could move or resize artists on the canvas to suit their needs. Also, the user should be able to highlight (with a mouse over) an artist, and select it with a double-click, if the application supports that sort of thing. In this MEP, we also want to support the highlighting and selection natively; it is up to application to handle what happens when the artist is selected. A typical handling would be to display a dialog to edit the properties of the artist.

In the future, as well (this is not part of this MEP), matplotlib could offer backend-specific property dialogs for each artist, which are raised on artist selection. This MEP would be a necessary stepping stone for that sort of capability.

There are currently a few interactive capabilities in matplotlib (e.g. legend.draggable()), but they tend to be scattered and are not available for all artists. This MEP seeks to unify the interactive interface and make it work for all artists.

The current MEP also includes grab handles for resizing artists, and appropriate boxes drawn when artists are moved or resized.

## Implementation

  - Add appropriate methods to the "tree" of artists so that the interactivity manager has a consistent interface for the interactivity manager to deal with. The proposed methods to add to the artists, if they are to support interactivity, are:
      - get\_pixel\_position\_ll(self): get the pixel position of the lower left corner of the artist's bounding box
      - get\_pixel\_size(self): get the size of the artist's bounding box, in pixels
      - set\_pixel\_position\_and\_size(self,x,y,dx,dy): set the new size of the artist, such that it fits within the specified bounding box.
  - add capability to the backends to 1) provide cursors, since these are needed for visual indication of moving/resizing, and 2) provide a function that gets the current mouse position
  - Implement the manager. This has already been done privately (by dhyams) as a mixin, and has been tested quite a bit. The goal would be to move the functionality of the manager into the artists so that it is in matplotlib properly, and not as a "monkey patch" as I currently have it coded.

## Current summary of the mixin

(Note that this mixin is for now just private code, but can be added to a branch obviously)

InteractiveArtistMixin:

Mixin class to make any generic object that is drawn on a matplotlib canvas moveable and possibly resizeable. The Powerpoint model is followed as closely as possible; not because I'm enamoured with Powerpoint, but because that's what most people understand. An artist can also be selectable, which means that the artist will receive the on\_activated() callback when double clicked. Finally, an artist can be highlightable, which means that a highlight is drawn on the artist whenever the mouse passes over. Typically, highlightable artists will also be selectable, but that is left up to the user. So, basically there are four attributes that can be set by the user on a per-artist basis:

  - highlightable
  - selectable
  - moveable
  - resizeable

To be moveable (draggable) or resizeable, the object that is the target of the mixin must support the following protocols:

  - get\_pixel\_position\_ll(self)
  - get\_pixel\_size(self)
  - set\_pixel\_position\_and\_size(self,x,y,sx,sy)

Note that nonresizeable objects are free to ignore the sx and sy parameters. To be highlightable, the object that is the target of the mixin must also support the following protocol:

  - get\_highlight(self)

Which returns a list of artists that will be used to draw the highlight.

If the object that is the target of the mixin is not an matplotlib artist, the following protocols must also be implemented. Doing so is usually fairly trivial, as there has to be an artist *somewhere* that is being drawn. Typically your object would just route these calls to that artist.

  - get\_figure(self)
  - get\_axes(self)
  - contains(self,event)
  - set\_animated(self,flag)
  - draw(self,renderer)
  - get\_visible(self)

The following notifications are called on the artist, and the artist can optionally implement these.

  - on\_select\_begin(self)
  - on\_select\_end(self)
  - on\_drag\_begin(self)
  - on\_drag\_end(self)
  - on\_activated(self)
  - on\_highlight(self)
  - on\_right\_click(self,event)
  - on\_left\_click(self,event)
  - on\_middle\_click(self,event)
  - on\_context\_click(self,event)
  - on\_key\_up(self,event)
  - on\_key\_down(self,event)

The following notifications are called on the canvas, if no interactive artist handles the event:

  - on\_press(self,event)
  - on\_left\_click(self,event)
  - on\_middle\_click(self,event)
  - on\_right\_click(self,event)
  - on\_context\_click(self,event)
  - on\_key\_up(self,event)
  - on\_key\_down(self,event)

The following functions, if present, can be used to modify the behavior of the interactive object:

  - press\_filter(self,event) \# determines if the object wants to have the press event routed to it
  - handle\_unpicked\_cursor() \# can be used by the object to set a cursor as the cursor passes over the object when it is unpicked.

Supports multiple canvases, maintaining a drag lock, motion notifier, and a global "enabled" flag per canvas. Supports fixed aspect ratio resizings by holding the shift key during the resize.

Known problems:

  - Zorder is not obeyed during the selection/drag operations. Because of the blit technique used, I do not believe this can be fixed. The only way I can think of is to search for all artists that have a zorder greater then me, set them all to animated, and then redraw them all on top during each drag refresh. This might be very slow; need to try.
  - the mixin only works for wx backends because of two things: 1) the cursors are hardcoded, and 2) there is a call to wx.GetMousePosition() Both of these shortcomings are reasonably fixed by having each backend supply these things.

## Backward compatibility

No problems with backward compatibility, although once this is in place, it would be appropriate to obsolete some of the existing interactive functions (like legend.draggable())

## Alternatives

None that I know of.

# MEP10: Docstring consistency

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Progress**

This is still an on-going effort

## Branches and Pull requests

## Abstract

matplotlib has a great deal of inconsistency between docstrings. This not only makes the docs harder to read, but it is harder on contributors, because they don't know which specifications to follow. There should be a clear docstring convention that is followed consistently.

The organization of the API documentation is difficult to follow. Some pages, such as pyplot and axes, are enormous and hard to browse. There should instead be short summary tables that link to detailed documentation. In addition, some of the docstrings themselves are quite long and contain redundant information.

Building the documentation takes a long time and uses a `make.py` script rather than a Makefile.

## Detailed description

There are number of new tools and conventions available since matplotlib started using Sphinx that make life easier. The following is a list of proposed changes to docstrings, most of which involve these new features.

### Numpy docstring format

[Numpy docstring format](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt): This format divides the docstring into clear sections, each having different parsing rules that make the docstring easy to read both as raw text and as HTML. We could consider alternatives, or invent our own, but this is a strong choice, as it's well used and understood in the Numpy/Scipy community.

### Cross references

Most of the docstrings in matplotlib use explicit "roles" when linking to other items, for example: `` `myfunction ``<span class="title-ref">. As of Sphinx 0.4, there is a "default\_role" that can be set to "obj", which will polymorphically link to a Python object of any type. This allows one to write </span>`myfunction`<span class="title-ref"> instead. This makes docstrings much easier to read and edit as raw text. Additionally, Sphinx allows for setting a current module, so links like </span>`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set_xlim`<span class="title-ref"> could be written as </span>`~axes.Axes.set_xlim`\`.

### Overriding signatures

Many methods in matplotlib use the `*args` and `**kwargs` syntax to dynamically handle the keyword arguments that are accepted by the function, or to delegate on to another function. This, however, is often not useful as a signature in the documentation. For this reason, many matplotlib methods include something like:

    def annotate(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        Create an annotation: a piece of text referring to a data
        point.
    
        Call signature::
    
          annotate(s, xy, xytext=None, xycoords='data',
                   textcoords='data', arrowprops=None, **kwargs)
        """

This can't be parsed by Sphinx, and is rather verbose in raw text. As of Sphinx 1.1, if the `autodoc_docstring_signature` config value is set to True, Sphinx will extract a replacement signature from the first line of the docstring, allowing this:

    def annotate(self, *args, **kwargs):
        """
        annotate(s, xy, xytext=None, xycoords='data',
                   textcoords='data', arrowprops=None, **kwargs)
    
        Create an annotation: a piece of text referring to a data
        point.
        """

The explicit signature will replace the actual Python one in the generated documentation.

### Linking rather than duplicating

Many of the docstrings include long lists of accepted keywords by interpolating things into the docstring at load time. This makes the docstrings very long. Also, since these tables are the same across many docstrings, it inserts a lot of redundant information in the docs -- particularly a problem in the printed version.

These tables should be moved to docstrings on functions whose only purpose is for help. The docstrings that refer to these tables should link to them, rather than including them verbatim.

### autosummary extension

The Sphinx autosummary extension should be used to generate summary tables, that link to separate pages of documentation. Some classes that have many methods (e.g. <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span>) should be documented with one method per page, whereas smaller classes should have all of their methods together.

### Examples linking to relevant documentation

The examples, while helpful at illustrating how to use a feature, do not link back to the relevant docstrings. This could be addressed by adding module-level docstrings to the examples, and then including that docstring in the parsed content on the example page. These docstrings could easily include references to any other part of the documentation.

### Documentation using help() vs. a browser

Using Sphinx markup in the source allows for good-looking docs in your browser, but the markup also makes the raw text returned using help() look terrible. One of the aims of improving the docstrings should be to make both methods of accessing the docs look good.

## Implementation

1.  The numpydoc extensions should be turned on for matplotlib. There is an important question as to whether these should be included in the matplotlib source tree, or used as a dependency. Installing Numpy is not sufficient to get the numpydoc extensions -- it's a separate install procedure. In any case, to the extent that they require customization for our needs, we should endeavor to submit those changes upstream and not fork them.
2.  Manually go through all of the docstrings and update them to the new format and conventions. Updating the cross references (from `  `myfunc`` ` to ``<span class="title-ref">func</span>\`\`) may be able to be semi-automated. This is a lot of busy work, and perhaps this labor should be divided on a per-module basis so no single developer is over-burdened by it.
3.  Reorganize the API docs using autosummary and `sphinx-autogen`. This should hopefully have minimal impact on the narrative documentation.
4.  Modify the example page generator (`gen_rst.py`) so that it extracts the module docstring from the example and includes it in a non-literal part of the example page.
5.  Use `sphinx-quickstart` to generate a new-style Sphinx Makefile. The following features in the current `make.py` will have to be addressed in some other way:
      - Copying of some static content
      - Specifying a "small" build (only low-resolution PNG files for examples)

Steps 1, 2, and 3 are interdependent. 4 and 5 may be done independently, though 5 has some dependency on 3.

## Backward compatibility

As this mainly involves docstrings, there should be minimal impact on backward compatibility.

## Alternatives

None yet discussed.

# MEP11: Third-party dependencies

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

This MEP attempts to improve the way in which third-party dependencies in matplotlib are handled.

## Status

**Completed** -- needs to be merged

## Branches and Pull requests

\#1157: Use automatic dependency resolution

\#1290: Debundle pyparsing

\#1261: Update six to 1.2

## Abstract

One of the goals of matplotlib has been to keep it as easy to install as possible. To that end, some third-party dependencies are included in the source tree and, under certain circumstances, installed alongside matplotlib. This MEP aims to resolve some problems with that approach, bring some consistency, while continuing to make installation convenient.

At the time that was initially done, [setuptools](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/), [easy\_install](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org) were not mature enough to be relied on. However, at present, we should be able to safely leverage the "modern" versions of those tools, [distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).

While matplotlib has dependencies on both Python libraries and C/C++ libraries, this MEP addresses only the Python libraries so as to not confuse the issue. C libraries represent a larger and mostly orthogonal set of problems.

## Detailed description

matplotlib depends on the following third-party Python libraries:

  - Numpy
  - dateutil (pure Python)
  - pytz (pure Python)
  - six -- required by dateutil (pure Python)
  - pyparsing (pure Python)
  - PIL (optional)
  - GUI frameworks: pygtk, gobject, tkinter, PySide, PyQt4, wx (all optional, but one is required for an interactive GUI)

### Current behavior

When installing from source, a `git` checkout or [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):

  - `setup.py` attempts to `import numpy`. If this fails, the installation fails.
  - For each of [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/), `setup.py` attempts to import them (from the top-level namespace). If that fails, matplotlib installs its local copy of the library into the top-level namespace.
  - [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is always installed inside of the matplotlib namespace.

This behavior is most surprising when used with [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), because no [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) dependency resolution is performed, even though it is likely to work for all of these packages.

The fact that [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) is installed in the matplotlib namespace has reportedly (\#1290) confused some users into thinking it is a matplotlib-related module and import it from there rather than the top-level.

When installing using the Windows installer, [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) are installed at the top-level *always*, potentially overwriting already installed copies of those libraries.

TODO: Describe behavior with the OS-X installer.

When installing using a package manager (Debian, RedHat, MacPorts etc.), this behavior actually does the right thing, and there are no special patches in the matplotlib packages to deal with the fact that we handle [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/) and [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) in this way. However, care should be taken that whatever approach we move to continues to work in that context.

Maintaining these packages in the matplotlib tree and making sure they are up-to-date is a maintenance burden. Advanced new features that may require a third-party pure Python library have a higher barrier to inclusion because of this burden.

### Desired behavior

Third-party dependencies are downloaded and installed from their canonical locations by leveraging [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and [PyPI](https://pypi.org).

[dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/), and [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) should be made into optional dependencies -- though obviously some features would fail if they aren't installed. This will allow the user to decide whether they want to bother installing a particular feature.

## Implementation

For installing from source, and assuming the user has all of the C-level compilers and dependencies, this can be accomplished fairly easily using [distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) and following the instructions [here](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/). The only anticipated change to the matplotlib library code will be to import [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) from the top-level namespace rather than from within matplotlib. Note that [distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/) will also allow us to remove the direct dependency on [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/), since it is, strictly speaking, only a direct dependency of [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/).

For binary installations, there are a number of alternatives (here ordered from best/hardest to worst/easiest):

1.  The distutils wininst installer allows a post-install script to run. It might be possible to get this script to run [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) to install the other dependencies. (See [this thread](http://grokbase.com/t/python/distutils-sig/109bdnfhp4/distutils-ann-setuptools-post-install-script-for-bdist-wininst) for someone who has trod that ground before).
2.  Continue to ship [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/), [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) and [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) in our installer, but use the post-install-script to install them *only* if they cannot already be found.
3.  Move all of these packages inside a (new) `matplotlib.extern` namespace so it is clear for outside users that these are external packages. Add some conditional imports in the core matplotlib codebase so [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) (at the top-level) is tried first, and failing that `matplotlib.extern.dateutil` is used.

2 and 3 are undesirable as they still require maintaining copies of these packages in our tree -- and this is exacerbated by the fact that they are used less -- only in the binary installers. None of these 3 approaches address Numpy, which will still have to be manually installed using an installer.

TODO: How does this relate to the Mac OS-X installer?

## Backward compatibility

At present, matplotlib can be installed from source on a machine without the third party dependencies and without an internet connection. After this change, an internet connection (and a working PyPI) will be required to install matplotlib for the first time. (Subsequent matplotlib updates or development work will run without accessing the network).

## Alternatives

Distributing binary eggs doesn't feel like a usable solution. That requires getting [easy\_install](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/easy_install.html) installed first, and Windows users generally prefer the well known `.exe` or `.msi` installer that works out of the box.

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Progress**

Initial changes added in 1.3. Conversion of the gallery is on-going. 29 September 2015 - The last `pylab_examples` where `pylab` is imported has been converted over to use `matplotlib.pyplot` and <span class="title-ref">numpy</span>.

## Branches and Pull requests

\#1623, \#1924, \#2181

PR [\#2474](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/2474) demonstrates a single example being cleaned up and moved to the appropriate section.

## Abstract

Reorganizing the matplotlib plot gallery would greatly simplify navigation of the gallery. In addition, examples should be cleaned-up and simplified for clarity.

## Detailed description

The matplotlib gallery was recently set up to split examples up into sections. As discussed in that PR\[1\], the current example sections (`api`, `pylab_examples`) aren't terribly useful to users: New sections in the gallery would help users find relevant examples.

These sections would also guide a cleanup of the examples: Initially, all the current examples would remain and be listed under their current directories. Over time, these examples could be cleaned up and moved into one of the new sections.

This process allows users to easily identify examples that need to be cleaned up; i.e. anything in the `api` and `pylab_examples` directories.

## Implementation

1.  Create new gallery sections. \[Done\]
2.  Clean up examples and move them to the new gallery sections (over the course of many PRs and with the help of many users/developers). \[In progress\]

### Gallery sections

The naming of sections is critical and will guide the clean-up effort. The current sections are:

  - Lines, bars, and markers (more-or-less 1D data)
  - Shapes and collections
  - Statistical plots
  - Images, contours, and fields
  - Pie and polar charts: Round things
  - Color
  - Text, labels, and annotations
  - Ticks and spines
  - Subplots, axes, and figures
  - Specialty plots (e.g., sankey, radar, tornado)
  - Showcase (plots with tweaks to make them publication-quality)
  - separate sections for toolboxes (already exists: 'mplot3d', 'axes\_grid', 'units', 'widgets')

These names are certainly up for debate. As these sections grow, we should reevaluate them and split them up as necessary.

### Clean up guidelines

The current examples in the `api` and `pylab_examples` sections of the gallery would remain in those directories until they are cleaned up. After clean-up, they would be moved to one of the new gallery sections described above. "Clean-up" should involve:

  - [sphinx-gallery docstrings](https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/): a title and a description of the example formatted as follows, at the top of the example:
    
        """
        ===============================
        Colormaps alter your perception
        ===============================
        
        Here I plot the function
        
        .. math:: f(x, y) = \sin(x) + \cos(y)
        
        with different colormaps. Look at how colormaps alter your perception!
        """

  - [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) clean-ups (running [flake8](https://pypi.org/project/flake8/), or a similar checker, is highly recommended)

  - Commented-out code should be removed.

  - Replace uses of <span class="title-ref">pylab</span> interface with <span class="title-ref">.pyplot</span> (+ <span class="title-ref">numpy</span>, etc.). See [c25ef1e](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/c25ef1e02b3a0ecb279492409dac0de9b3d2c0e2)

  - Remove shebang line, e.g.:
    
        #!/usr/bin/env python

  - Use consistent imports. In particular:
    
        import numpy as np
        
        import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    Avoid importing specific functions from these modules (e.g. `from numpy import sin`)

  - Each example should focus on a specific feature (excluding `showcase` examples, which will show more "polished" plots). Tweaking unrelated to that feature should be removed. See [f7b2217](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/f7b2217a1f92343e8aca0684d19c9915cc2e8674), [e57b5fc](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/e57b5fc31fbad83ed9c43c77ef15368efdcb9ec1), and [1458aa8](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/1458aa87c5eae9dd99e141956a6adf7a0f3c6707)

Use of <span class="title-ref">pylab</span> should be demonstrated/discussed on a dedicated help page instead of the gallery examples.

**Note:** When moving an existing example, you should search for references to that example. For example, the API documentation for `axes.py` and `pyplot.py` may use these examples to generate plots. Use your favorite search tool (e.g., grep, ack, [grin](https://pypi.org/project/grin/), [pss](https://pypi.org/project/pss/)) to search the matplotlib package. See [2dc9a46](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/2dc9a4651e5e566afc0866c603aa8d06aaf32b71) and [aa6b410](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/aa6b410f9fa085ccf5f4f962a6f26af5beeae7af)

#### Additional suggestions

  - Provide links (both ways) between examples and API docs for the methods/objects used. (issue [\#2222](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/2222))
  - Use `plt.subplots` (note trailing "s") in preference over `plt.subplot`.
  - Rename the example to clarify it's purpose. For example, the most basic demo of `imshow` might be `imshow_demo.py`, and one demonstrating different interpolation settings would be `imshow_demo_interpolation.py` (*not* `imshow_demo2.py`).
  - Split up examples that try to do too much. See [5099675](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/509967518ce5ce5ba31edf12486ffaa344e748f2) and [fc2ab07](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/fc2ab07cc586abba4c024d8c0d841c4357a3936f)
  - Delete examples that don't show anything new.
  - Some examples exercise esoteric features for unit testing. These tweaks should be moved out of the gallery to an example in the `unit` directory located in the root directory of the package.
  - Add plot titles to clarify intent of the example. See [bd2b13c](https://github.com/tonysyu/matplotlib/commit/bd2b13c54bf4aa2058781b9a805d68f2feab5ba5)

## Backward compatibility

The website for each Matplotlib version is readily accessible, so users who want to refer to old examples can still do so.

## Alternatives

### Tags

Tagging examples will also help users search the example gallery. Although tags would be a big win for users with specific goals, the plot gallery will remain the entry point to these examples, and sections could really help users navigate the gallery. Thus, tags are complementary to this reorganization.

# MEP13: Use properties for Artists

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

  - **Discussion**

## Branches and Pull requests

None

## Abstract

Wrap all of the matplotlib getter and setter methods with python [properties](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#property), allowing them to be read and written like class attributes.

## Detailed description

Currently matplotlib uses getter and setter functions (usually prefixed with get\_ and set\_, respectively) for reading and writing data related to classes. However, since 2.6 python supports properties, which allow such setter and getter functions to be accessed as though they were attributes. This proposal would implement all existing setter and getter methods as properties.

## Implementation

1.  All existing getter and setter methods will need to have two aliases, one with the get\_ or set\_ prefix and one without. Getter methods that currently lack prefixes should be recording in a text file.
2.  Classes should be reorganized so setter and getter methods are sequential in the code, with getter methods first.
3.  Getter and setter methods that provide additional optional arguments should have those arguments accessible in another manner, either as additional getter or setter methods or attributes of other classes. If those classes are not accessible, getters for them should be added.
4.  Property decorators will be added to the setter and getter methods without the prefix. Those with the prefix will be marked as deprecated.
5.  Docstrings will need to be rewritten so the getter with the prefix has the current docstring and the getter without the prefix has a generic docstring appropriate for an attribute.
6.  Automatic alias generation will need to be modified so it will also create aliases for the properties.
7.  All instances of getter and setter method calls will need to be changed to attribute access.
8.  All setter and getter aliases with prefixes will be removed

The following steps can be done simultaneously: 1, 2, and 3; 4 and 5; 6 and 7.

Only the following steps must be done in the same release: 4, 5, and 6. All other changes can be done in separate releases. 8 should be done several macro releases after everything else.

## Backward compatibility

All existing getter methods that do not have a prefix (such as get\_) will need to be changed from function calls to attribute access. In most cases this will only require removing the parenthesis.

setter and getter methods that have additional optional arguments will need to have those arguments implemented in another way, either as a separate property in the same class or as attributes or properties of another class.

Cases where the setter returns a value will need to be changed to using the setter followed by the getter.

Cases where there are set\_ATTR\_on() and set\_ATTR\_off() methods will be changed to ATTR\_on properties.

## Examples

### axes.Axes.set\_axis\_off/set\_axis\_on

Current implementation: :

    axes.Axes.set_axis_off()
    axes.Axes.set_axis_on()

New implementation: :

    True = axes.Axes.axis_on
    False = axes.Axes.axis_on
    axes.Axes.axis_on = True
    axes.Axes.axis_on = False

### axes.Axes.get\_xlim/set\_xlim and get\_autoscalex\_on/set\_autoscalex\_on

Current implementation: :

    [left, right] = axes.Axes.get_xlim()
    auto = axes.Axes.get_autoscalex_on()
    
    [left, right] = axes.Axes.set_xlim(left=left, right=right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
    [left, right] = axes.Axes.set_xlim(left=left, right=None, emit=emit, auto=auto)
    [left, right] = axes.Axes.set_xlim(left=None, right=right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
    [left, right] = axes.Axes.set_xlim(left=left, emit=emit, auto=auto)
    [left, right] = axes.Axes.set_xlim(right=right, emit=emit, auto=auto)
    
    axes.Axes.set_autoscalex_on(auto)

New implementation: :

    [left, right] = axes.Axes.axes_xlim
    auto = axes.Axes.autoscalex_on
    
    axes.Axes.axes_xlim = [left, right]
    axes.Axes.axes_xlim = [left, None]
    axes.Axes.axes_xlim = [None, right]
    axes.Axes.axes_xlim[0] = left
    axes.Axes.axes_xlim[1] = right
    
    axes.Axes.autoscalex_on = auto
    
    axes.Axes.emit_xlim = emit

### axes.Axes.get\_title/set\_title

Current implementation: :

    string = axes.Axes.get_title()
    axes.Axes.set_title(string, fontdict=fontdict, **kwargs)

New implementation: :

    string = axes.Axes.title
    string = axes.Axes.title_text.text
    
    text.Text = axes.Axes.title_text
    text.Text.<attribute> = attribute
    text.Text.fontdict = fontdict
    
    axes.Axes.title = string
    axes.Axes.title = text.Text
    axes.Axes.title_text = string
    axes.Axes.title_text = text.Text

### axes.Axes.get\_xticklabels/set\_xticklabels

Current implementation: :

    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.get_xticklabels()
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.get_xticklabels(minor=False)
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.get_xticklabels(minor=True)
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.([string], fontdict=None, **kwargs)
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.([string], fontdict=None, minor=False, **kwargs)
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.([string], fontdict=None, minor=True, **kwargs)

New implementation: :

    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.xticklabels
    [text.Text] = axes.Axes.xminorticklabels
    axes.Axes.xticklabels = [string]
    axes.Axes.xminorticklabels = [string]
    axes.Axes.xticklabels = [text.Text]
    axes.Axes.xminorticklabels = [text.Text]

## Alternatives

Instead of using decorators, it is also possible to use the property function. This would change the procedure so that all getter methods that lack a prefix will need to be renamed or removed. This makes handling docstrings more difficult and harder to read.

It is not necessary to deprecate the setter and getter methods, but leaving them in will complicate the code.

This could also serve as an opportunity to rewrite or even remove automatic alias generation.

Another alternate proposal:

Convert `set_xlim`, `set_xlabel`, `set_title`, etc. to `xlim`, `xlabel`, `title`,... to make the transition from `plt` functions to `axes` methods significantly simpler. These would still be methods, not properties, but it's still a great usability enhancement while retaining the interface.

# MEP14: Text handling

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

  - **Discussion**

## Branches and Pull requests

Issue \#253 demonstrates a bug where using the bounding box rather than the advance width of text results in misaligned text. This is a minor point in the grand scheme of things, but it should be addressed as part of this MEP.

## Abstract

By reorganizing how text is handled, this MEP aims to:

  - improve support for Unicode and non-ltr languages
  - improve text layout (especially multi-line text)
  - allow support for more fonts, especially non-Apple-format TrueType fonts and OpenType fonts.
  - make the font configuration easier and more transparent

## Detailed description

**Text layout**

At present, matplotlib has two different ways to render text: "built-in" (based on FreeType and our own Python code), and "usetex" (based on calling out to a TeX installation). Adjunct to the "built-in" renderer there is also the Python-based "mathtext" system for rendering mathematical equations using a subset of the TeX language without having a TeX installation available. Support for these two engines in strewn about many source files, including every backend, where one finds clauses like :

    if rcParams['text.usetex']: # do one thing else: # do another

Adding a third text rendering approach (more on that later) would require editing all of these places as well, and therefore doesn't scale.

Instead, this MEP proposes adding a concept of "text engines", where the user could select one of many different approaches for rendering text. The implementations of each of these would be localized to their own set of modules, and not have little pieces around the whole source tree.

Why add more text rendering engines? The "built-in" text rendering has a number of shortcomings.

  - It only handles right-to-left languages, and doesn't handle many special features of Unicode, such as combining diacriticals.
  - The multiline support is imperfect and only supports manual line-breaking -- it cannot break up a paragraph into lines of a certain length.
  - It also does not handle inline formatting changes in order to support something like Markdown, reStructuredText or HTML. (Though rich-text formatting is contemplated in this MEP, since we want to make sure this design allows it, the specifics of a rich-text formatting implementation is outside of the scope of this MEP.)

Supporting these things is difficult, and is the "full-time job" of a number of other projects:

  - [pango](https://pango.gnome.org)/[harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz)
  - [QtTextLayout](https://doc.qt.io/archives/qt-4.8/qtextlayout.html)
  - [Microsoft DirectWrite](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-ca/windows/win32/directwrite/introducing-directwrite)
  - [Apple Core Text](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/StringsTextFonts/Conceptual/CoreText_Programming/Overview/Overview.html)

Of the above options, it should be noted that [harfbuzz](https://github.com/harfbuzz/harfbuzz) is designed from the start as a cross platform option with minimal dependencies, so therefore is a good candidate for a single option to support.

Additionally, for supporting rich text, we could consider using [WebKit](https://webkit.org/), and possibly whether than represents a good single cross-platform option. Again, however, rich text formatting is outside of the scope of this project.

Rather than trying to reinvent the wheel and add these features to matplotlib's "built-in" text renderer, we should provide a way to leverage these projects to get more powerful text layout. The "built-in" renderer will still need to exist for reasons of ease of installation, but its feature set will be more limited compared to the others. \[TODO: This MEP should clearly decide what those limited features are, and fix any bugs to bring the implementation into a state of working correctly in all cases that we want it to work. I know @leejjoon has some thoughts on this.\]

**Font selection**

Going from an abstract description of a font to a file on disk is the task of the font selection algorithm -- it turns out to be much more complicated than it seems at first.

The "built-in" and "usetex" renderers have very different ways of handling font selection, given their different technologies. TeX requires the installation of TeX-specific font packages, for example, and cannot use TrueType fonts directly. Unfortunately, despite the different semantics for font selection, the same set of font properties are used for each. This is true of both the <span class="title-ref">.FontProperties</span> class and the font-related <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span> (which basically share the same code underneath). Instead, we should define a core set of font selection parameters that will work across all text engines, and have engine-specific configuration to allow the user to do engine-specific things when required. For example, it is possible to directly select a font by name in the "built-in" using `font.family`, but the same is not possible with "usetex". It may be possible to make it easier to use TrueType fonts by using XeTeX, but users will still want to use the traditional metafonts through TeX font packages. So the issue still stands that different text engines will need engine-specific configuration, and it should be more obvious to the user which configuration will work across text engines and which are engine-specific.

Note that even excluding "usetex", there are different ways to find fonts. The default is to use the font list cache in `.font_manager` which matches fonts using our own algorithm based on the [CSS font matching algorithm](http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS2/fonts.html#algorithm). It doesn't always do the same thing as the native font selection algorithms on Linux ([fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/)), Mac and Windows, and it doesn't always find all of the fonts on the system that the OS would normally pick up. However, it is cross-platform, and always finds the fonts that ship with matplotlib. The Cairo and MacOSX backends (and presumably a future HTML5-based backend) currently bypass this mechanism and use the OS-native ones. The same is true when not embedding fonts in SVG, PS or PDF files and opening them in a third-party viewer. A downside there is that (at least with Cairo, need to confirm with MacOSX) they don't always find the fonts we ship with matplotlib. (It may be possible to add the fonts to their search path, though, or we may need to find a way to install our fonts to a location the OS expects to find them).

There are also special modes in the PS and PDF to only use the core fonts that are always available to those formats. There, the font lookup mechanism must only match against those fonts. It is unclear whether the OS-native font lookup systems can handle this case.

There is also experimental support for using [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) for font selection in matplotlib, turned off by default. fontconfig is the native font selection algorithm on Linux, but is also cross platform and works well on the other platforms (though obviously is an additional dependency there).

Many of the text layout libraries proposed above (pango, QtTextLayout, DirectWrite and CoreText etc.) insist on using the font selection library from their own ecosystem.

All of the above seems to suggest that we should move away from our self-written font selection algorithm and use the native APIs where possible. That's what Cairo and MacOSX backends already want to use, and it will be a requirement of any complex text layout library. On Linux, we already have the bones of a [fontconfig](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/fontconfig/) implementation (which could also be accessed through pango). On Windows and Mac we may need to write custom wrappers. The nice thing is that the API for font lookup is relatively small, and essentially consist of "given a dictionary of font properties, give me a matching font file".

**Font subsetting**

Font subsetting is currently handled using ttconv. ttconv was a standalone commandline utility for converting TrueType fonts to subsetted Type 3 fonts (among other features) written in 1995, which matplotlib (well, I) forked in order to make it work as a library. It only handles Apple-style TrueType fonts, not ones with the Microsoft (or other vendor) encodings. It doesn't handle OpenType fonts at all. This means that even though the STIX fonts come as .otf files, we have to convert them to .ttf files to ship them with matplotlib. The Linux packagers hate this -- they'd rather just depend on the upstream STIX fonts. ttconv has also been shown to have a few bugs that have been difficult to fix over time.

Instead, we should be able to use FreeType to get the font outlines and write our own code (probably in Python) to output subsetted fonts (Type 3 on PS and PDF and paths on SVG). Freetype, as a popular and well-maintained project, handles a wide variety of fonts in the wild. This would remove a lot of custom C code, and remove some code duplication between backends.

Note that subsetting fonts this way, while the easiest route, does lose the hinting in the font, so we will need to continue, as we do now, provide a way to embed the entire font in the file where possible.

Alternative font subsetting options include using the subsetting built-in to Cairo (not clear if it can be used without the rest of Cairo), or using [fontforge](https://fontforge.org) (which is a heavy and not terribly cross-platform dependency).

**Freetype wrappers**

Our FreeType wrapper could really use a reworking. It defines its own image buffer class (when a Numpy array would be easier). While FreeType can handle a huge diversity of font files, there are limitations to our wrapper that make it much harder to support non-Apple-vendor TrueType files, and certain features of OpenType files. (See \#2088 for a terrible result of this, just to support the fonts that ship with Windows 7 and 8). I think a fresh rewrite of this wrapper would go a long way.

**Text anchoring and alignment and rotation**

The handling of baselines was changed in 1.3.0 such that the backends are now given the location of the baseline of the text, not the bottom of the text. This is probably the correct behavior, and the MEP refactoring should also follow this convention.

In order to support alignment on multi-line text, it should be the responsibility of the (proposed) text engine to handle text alignment. For a given chunk of text, each engine calculates a bounding box for that text and the offset of the anchor point within that box. Therefore, if the va of a block was "top", the anchor point would be at the top of the box.

Rotating of text should always be around the anchor point. I'm not sure that lines up with current behavior in matplotlib, but it seems like the sanest/least surprising choice. \[This could be revisited once we have something working\]. Rotation of text should not be handled by the text engine -- that should be handled by a layer between the text engine and the rendering backend so it can be handled in a uniform way. \[I don't see any advantage to rotation being handled by the text engines individually...\]

There are other problems with text alignment and anchoring that should be resolved as part of this work. \[TODO: enumerate these\].

**Other minor problems to fix**

The mathtext code has backend-specific code -- it should instead provide its output as just another text engine. However, it's still desirable to have mathtext layout inserted as part of a larger layout performed by another text engine, so it should be possible to do this. It's an open question whether embedding the text layout of an arbitrary text engine in another should be possible.

The text mode is currently set by a global rcParam ("text.usetex") so it's either all on or all off. We should continue to have a global rcParam to choose the text engine ("text.layout\_engine"), but it should under the hood be an overridable property on the <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> object, so the same figure can combine the results of multiple text layout engines if necessary.

## Implementation

A concept of a "text engine" will be introduced. Each text engine will implement a number of abstract classes. The `TextFont` interface will represent text for a given set of font properties. It isn't necessarily limited to a single font file -- if the layout engine supports rich text, it may handle a number of font files in a family. Given a `TextFont` instance, the user can get a `TextLayout` instance, which represents the layout for a given string of text in a given font. From a `TextLayout`, an iterator over `TextSpan`s is returned so the engine can output raw editable text using as few spans as possible. If the engine would rather get individual characters, they can be obtained from the `TextSpan` instance:

    class TextFont(TextFontBase):
        def __init__(self, font_properties):
            """
            Create a new object for rendering text using the given font properties.
            """
            pass
    
        def get_layout(self, s, ha, va):
            """
            Get the TextLayout for the given string in the given font and
            the horizontal (left, center, right) and verticalalignment (top,
            center, baseline, bottom)
            """
            pass
    
    class TextLayout(TextLayoutBase):
        def get_metrics(self):
            """
            Return the bounding box of the layout, anchored at (0, 0).
            """
            pass
    
        def get_spans(self):
            """
            Returns an iterator over the spans of different in the layout.
            This is useful for backends that want to editable raw text as
            individual lines.  For rich text where the font may change,
            each span of different font type will have its own span.
            """
            pass
    
        def get_image(self):
            """
            Returns a rasterized image of the text.  Useful for raster backends,
            like Agg.
    
            In all likelihood, this will be overridden in the backend, as it can
            be created from get_layout(), but certain backends may want to
            override it if their library provides it (as freetype does).
            """
            pass
    
        def get_rectangles(self):

            """
            Get the path for the character.
            """
    pass

Graphic backends that want to output subset of fonts would likely build up a file-global dictionary of characters where the keys are (fontname, glyph\_id) and the values are the paths so that only one copy of the path for each character will be stored in the file.

Special casing: The "usetex" functionality currently is able to get Postscript directly from TeX to insert directly in a Postscript file, but for other backends, parses a DVI file and generates something more abstract. For a case like this, `TextLayout` would implement `get_spans` for most backends, but add `get_ps` for the Postscript backend, which would look for the presence of this method and use it if available, or fall back to `get_spans`. This kind of special casing may also be necessary, for example, when the graphics backend and text engine belong to the same ecosystem, e.g. Cairo and Pango, or MacOSX and CoreText.

There are three main pieces to the implementation:

1)  Rewriting the freetype wrapper, and removing ttconv.
    1)  Once (1) is done, as a proof of concept, we can move to the upstream STIX .otf fonts
    2)  Add support for web fonts loaded from a remote URL. (Enabled by using freetype for font subsetting).
2)  Refactoring the existing "builtin" and "usetex" code into separate text engines and to follow the API outlined above.
3)  Implementing support for advanced text layout libraries.

(1) and (2) are fairly independent, though having (1) done first will allow (2) to be simpler. (3) is dependent on (1) and (2), but even if it doesn't get done (or is postponed), completing (1) and (2) will make it easier to move forward with improving the "builtin" text engine.

## Backward compatibility

The layout of text with respect to its anchor and rotation will change in hopefully small, but improved, ways. The layout of multiline text will be much better, as it will respect horizontal alignment. The layout of bidirectional text or other advanced Unicode features will now work inherently, which may break some things if users are currently using their own workarounds.

Fonts will be selected differently. Hacks that used to sort of work between the "builtin" and "usetex" text rendering engines may no longer work. Fonts found by the OS that weren't previously found by matplotlib may be selected.

# MEP15: Fix axis autoscaling when limits are specified for one axis only

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Discussion**

## Branches and Pull requests

None so far.

## Abstract

When one Axis of a 2-dimensional plot is overridden via <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_xlim</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_ylim</span>, automatic scaling of the remaining Axis should be based on the data that falls within the specified limits of the first Axis.

## Detailed description

When axis limits for a 2-D plot are specified for one axis only (via <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_xlim</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_ylim</span>), matplotlib currently does not currently rescale the other axis. The result is that the displayed curves or symbols may be compressed into a tiny portion of the available area, so that the final plot conveys much less information than it would with appropriate axis scaling.

The proposed change of behavior would make matplotlib choose the scale for the remaining axis using only the data that falls within the limits for the axis where limits were specified.

## Implementation

I don't know enough about the internals of matplotlib to be able to suggest an implementation.

## Backward compatibility

From the standpoint of software interfaces, there would be no break in backward compatibility. Some outputs would be different, but if the user truly desires the previous behavior, he/she can achieve this by overriding the axis scaling for both axes.

## Alternatives

The only alternative that I can see is to maintain the status quo.

# MEP19: Continuous Integration

## Status

**Completed**

## Branches and Pull requests

## Abstract

matplotlib could benefit from better and more reliable continuous integration, both for testing and building installers and documentation.

## Detailed description

### Current state-of-the-art

**Testing**

matplotlib currently uses Travis-CI for automated tests. While Travis-CI should be praised for how much it does as a free service, it has a number of shortcomings:

  - It often fails due to network timeouts when installing dependencies.
  - It often fails for inexplicable reasons.
  - build or test products can only be saved from build off of branches on the main repo, not pull requests, so it is often difficult to "post mortem" analyse what went wrong. This is particularly frustrating when the failure cannot be subsequently reproduced locally.
  - It is not extremely fast. matplotlib's cpu and memory requirements for testing are much higher than the average Python project.
  - It only tests on Ubuntu Linux, and we have only minimal control over the specifics of the platform. It can be upgraded at any time outside of our control, causing unexpected delays at times that may not be convenient in our release schedule.

On the plus side, Travis-CI's integration with github -- automatically testing all pending pull requests -- is exceptional.

**Builds**

There is no centralized effort for automated binary builds for matplotlib. However, the following disparate things are being done \[If the authors mentioned here could fill in detail, that would be great\!\]:

  - @sandrotosi: builds Debian packages
  - @takluyver: Has automated Ubuntu builds on Launchpad
  - @cgohlke: Makes Windows builds (don't know how automated that is)
  - @r-owen: Makes OS-X builds (don't know how automated that is)

**Documentation**

Documentation of main is now built by travis and uploaded to <https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/index.html>

@NelleV, I believe, generates the docs automatically and posts them on the web to chart MEP10 progress.

### Peculiarities of matplotlib

matplotlib has complex requirements that make testing and building more taxing than many other Python projects.

  - The CPU time to run the tests is quite high. It puts us beyond the free accounts of many CI services (e.g. ShiningPanda)
  - It has a large number of dependencies, and testing the full matrix of all combinations is impractical. We need to be clever about what space we test and guarantee to support.

### Requirements

This section outlines the requirements that we would like to have.

1.  Testing all pull requests by hooking into the GitHub API, as Travis-CI does
2.  Testing on all major platforms: Linux, Mac OS-X, MS Windows (in that order of priority, based on user survey)
3.  Retain the last n days worth of build and test products, to aid in post-mortem debugging.
4.  Automated nightly binary builds, so that users can test the bleeding edge without installing a complete compilation environment.
5.  Automated benchmarking. It would be nice to have a standard benchmark suite (separate from the tests) whose performance could be tracked over time, in different backends and platforms. While this is separate from building and testing, ideally it would run on the same infrastructure.
6.  Automated nightly building and publishing of documentation (or as part of testing, to ensure PRs don't introduce documentation bugs). (This would not replace the static documentation for stable releases as a default).
7.  The test systems should be manageable by multiple developers, so that no single person becomes a bottleneck. (Travis-CI's design does this well -- storing build configuration in the git repository, rather than elsewhere, is a very good design.)
8.  Make it easy to test a large but sparse matrix of different versions of matplotlib's dependencies. The matplotlib user survey provides some good data as to where to focus our efforts: <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jbK0J4cIkyBNncnS-gP7pINSliNy9lI-N4JHwxlNSXE/edit>
9.  Nice to have: A decentralized design so that those with more obscure platforms can publish build results to a central dashboard.

## Implementation

This part is yet-to-be-written.

However, ideally, the implementation would be a third-party service, to avoid adding system administration to our already stretched time. As we have some donated funds, this service may be a paid one if it offers significant time-saving advantages over free offerings.

## Backward compatibility

Backward compatibility is not a major concern for this MEP. We will replace current tools and procedures with something better and throw out the old.

## Alternatives

## Hangout Notes

### CI Infrastructure

  - We like Travis and it will probably remain part of our arsenal in any event. The reliability issues are being looked into.
  - Enable Amazon S3 uploads of testing products on Travis. This will help with post-mortem of failures (@mdboom is looking into this now).
  - We want Mac coverage. The best bet is probably to push Travis to enable it for our project by paying them for a Pro account (since they don't otherwise allow testing on both Linux and Mac).
  - We want Windows coverage. Shining Panda is an option there.
  - Investigate finding or building a tool that would collect and synthesize test results from a number of sources and post it to GitHub using the GitHub API. This may be of general use to the Scipy community.
  - For both Windows and Mac, we should document (or better yet, script) the process of setting up the machine for a build, and how to build binaries and installers. This may require getting information from Russel Owen and Christoph Gohlke. This is a necessary step for doing automated builds, but would also be valuable for a number of other reasons.

### The test framework itself

  - We should investigate ways to make it take less time
      - Eliminating redundant tests, if possible
      - General performance improvements to matplotlib will help
  - We should be covering more things, particularly more backends
  - We should have more unit tests, fewer integration tests, if possible

# MEP21: color and cm refactor

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

  - **Discussion**: This MEP has not commenced yet, but here are some ongoing ideas which may become a part of this MEP:

## Branches and Pull requests

## Abstract

  - color
      - tidy up the namespace
      - Define a "Color" class
      - make it easy to convert from one color type to another `` `hex -> RGB ``<span class="title-ref">, </span>`RGB -> hex`<span class="title-ref">, </span>`HSV -> RGB`\` etc.
      - improve the construction of a colormap - the dictionary approach is archaic and overly complex (though incredibly powerful)
      - make it possible to interpolate between two or more color types in different modes, especially useful for construction of colormaps in HSV space for instance
  - cm
      - rename the module to something more descriptive - mappables?

Overall, there are a lot of improvements that can be made with matplotlib color handling - managing backwards compatibility will be difficult as there are some badly named variables/modules which really shouldn't exist - but a clear path and message for migration should be available, with a large amount of focus on this in the API changes documentation.

# MEP22: Toolbar rewrite

  - <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/1849>

  - <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/2465>

  - Keeping the NavigationToolbar classes <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/2759> **CLOSED**
  - Navigation by events: <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/3652>

## Abstract

The main goal of this MEP is to make it easier to modify (add, change, remove) the way the user interacts with the figures.

The user interaction with the figure is deeply integrated within the Canvas and Toolbar. Making extremely difficult to do any modification.

This MEP proposes the separation of this interaction into Toolbar, Navigation and Tools to provide independent access and reconfiguration.

This approach will make easier to create and share tools among users. In the far future, we can even foresee a kind of Marketplace for `Tool`s where the most popular can be added into the main distribution.

## Detailed description

The reconfiguration of the Toolbar is complex, most of the time it requires a custom backend.

The creation of custom Tools sometimes interferes with the Toolbar, as example see <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/2694> also the shortcuts are hardcoded and again not easily modifiable <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/2699>

The proposed solution is to take the actions out of the `Toolbar` and the shortcuts out of the `Canvas`. The actions and shortcuts will be in the form of `Tool`s.

A new class `Navigation` will be the bridge between the events from the `Canvas` and `Toolbar` and redirect them to the appropriate `Tool`.

At the end the user interaction will be divided into three classes:

  - NavigationBase: This class is instantiated for each FigureManager and connect the all user interactions with the Tools
  - ToolbarBase: This existing class is relegated only as a GUI access to Tools.
  - ToolBase: Is the basic definition of Tools.

## Implementation

### ToolBase(object)

Tools can have a graphical representation as the `SubplotTool` or not even be present in the Toolbar as `Quit`.

The <span class="title-ref">.ToolBase</span> has the following class attributes for configuration at definition time

  - keymap = None: Key(s) to be used to trigger the tool
  - description = '': Small description of the tool
  - image = None: Image that is used in the toolbar

The following instance attributes are set at instantiation:

  - name
  - navigation

#### Methods

  - `trigger(self, event)`: This is the main method of the Tool, it is called when the Tool is triggered by:
      - Toolbar button click
      - keypress associated with the Tool Keymap
      - Call to navigation.trigger\_tool(name)
  - `set_figure(self, figure)`: Set the figure and navigation attributes
  - `destroy(self, *args)`: Destroy the `Tool` graphical interface (if exists)

#### Available Tools

  - ToolQuit
  - ToolEnableAllNavigation
  - ToolEnableNavigation
  - ToolToggleGrid
  - ToolToggleFullScreen
  - ToolToggleYScale
  - ToolToggleXScale
  - ToolHome
  - ToolBack
  - ToolForward
  - SaveFigureBase
  - ConfigureSubplotsBase

### ToolToggleBase(ToolBase)

The <span class="title-ref">.ToolToggleBase</span> has the following class attributes for configuration at definition time

  - radio\_group = None: Attribute to group 'radio' like tools (mutually exclusive)
  - cursor = None: Cursor to use when the tool is active

The **Toggleable** Tools, can capture keypress, mouse moves, and mouse button press

#### Methods

  - `enable(self, event)`: Called by <span class="title-ref">.ToolToggleBase.trigger</span> method
  - `disable(self, event)`: Called when the tool is untoggled
  - `toggled`: **Property** True or False

#### Available Tools

  - ToolZoom
  - ToolPan

### NavigationBase

Defines the following attributes:

  - canvas:
  - keypresslock: Lock to know if the `canvas` `key_press_event` is available and process it
  - messagelock: Lock to know if the message is available to write

#### Methods (intended for the end user)

  - `nav_connect(self, s, func)`: Connect to navigation for events
  - `nav_disconnect(self, cid)`: Disconnect from navigation event
  - `message_event(self, message, sender=None)`: Emit a tool\_message\_event event
  - `active_toggle(self)`: **Property** The currently toggled tools or None
  - `get_tool_keymap(self, name)`: Return a list of keys that are associated with the tool
  - `set_tool_keymap(self, name,`\*keys`)`: Set the keys for the given tool
  - `remove_tool(self, name)`: Removes tool from the navigation control.
  - `add_tools(self, tools)`: Add multiple tools to `Navigation`
  - `add_tool(self, name, tool, group=None, position=None)`: Add a tool to the `Navigation`
  - `tool_trigger_event(self, name, sender=None, canvasevent=None, data=None)`: Trigger a tool and fire the event
  - `tools`: **Property** A dict with available tools with corresponding keymaps, descriptions and objects
  - `get_tool(self, name)`: Return the tool object

### ToolbarBase

#### Methods (for backend implementation)

  - `add_toolitem(self, name, group, position, image, description, toggle)`: Add a toolitem to the toolbar. This method is a callback from `tool_added_event` (emitted by navigation)
  - `set_message(self, s)`: Display a message on toolbar or in status bar
  - `toggle_toolitem(self, name)`: Toggle the toolitem without firing event.
  - `remove_toolitem(self, name)`: Remove a toolitem from the `Toolbar`

## Backward compatibility

For backward compatibility added 'navigation' to the list of values supported by `toolbar`, that is used for `Navigation` classes instantiation instead of the NavigationToolbar classes

With this parameter, it makes it transparent to anyone using the existing backends.

\[@pelson comment: This also gives us an opportunity to avoid needing to implement all of this in the same PR - some backends can potentially exist without the new functionality for a short while (but it must be done at some point).\]

# MEP23: Multiple Figures per GUI window

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Discussion**

## Branches and Pull requests

**Previous work** - <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/2465> **To-delete**

## Abstract

Add the possibility to have multiple figures grouped under the same <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span>

## Detailed description

Under the current structure, every canvas has its own window.

This is and may continue to be the desired method of operation for most use cases.

Sometimes when there are too many figures open at the same time, it is desirable to be able to group these under the same window. See `2194`.

The proposed solution modifies <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span> to contain and manage more than one `Canvas`. The `backend.multifigure` rcParam controls when the **MultiFigure** behaviour is desired.

**Note**

It is important to note, that the proposed solution, assumes that the [MEP22](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/Mep22). is already in place. This is simply because the actual implementation of the `Toolbar` makes it pretty hard to switch between canvases.

## Implementation

The first implementation will be done in GTK3 using a Notebook as canvas container.

### `FigureManagerBase`

will add the following new methods

  - `add_canvas`: To add a canvas to an existing <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> object
  - `remove_canvas`: To remove a canvas from a <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> object, if it is the last one, it will be destroyed
  - `move_canvas`: To move a canvas from one <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> to another.
  - `set_canvas_title`: To change the title associated with a specific canvas container
  - `get_canvas_title`: To get the title associated with a specific canvas container
  - `get_active_canvas`: To get the canvas that is in the foreground and is subject to the gui events. There is no `set_active_canvas` because the active canvas, is defined when `show` is called on a `Canvas` object.

### `new_figure_manager`

To control which <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> will contain the new figures, an extra optional parameter *figuremanager* will be added, this parameter value will be passed to `new_figure_manager_given_figure`.

### `new_figure_manager_given_figure`

  - If *figuremanager* parameter is given, this <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> object will be used instead of creating a new one.
  - If `rcParams['backend.multifigure']` is True: The last <span class="title-ref">\~.backend\_template.FigureManager</span> object will be used instead of creating a new one.

### `NavigationBase`

Modifies the `NavigationBase` to keep a list of canvases, directing the actions to the active one.

## Backward compatibility

For the **MultiFigure** properties to be visible, the user has to activate them directly setting `rcParams['backend.multifigure'] = True`

It should be backwards compatible for backends that adhere to the current <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span> structure even if they have not implemented the **MultiFigure** magic yet.

## Alternatives

Instead of modifying the <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase</span> it could be possible to add a parallel class, that handles the cases where `rcParams['backend.multifigure'] = True`. This will warranty that there won't be any problems with custom made backends, but also makes bigger the code, and more things to maintain.

# MEP24: Negative radius in polar plots

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

*Discussion*

## Branches and Pull requests

None

## Abstract

It is clear that polar plots need to be able to gracefully handle negative r values (not by clipping or reflection).

## Detailed description

One obvious application that we should support is bB plots (see <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/1730#issuecomment-40815837>), but this seems more generally useful (for example growth rate as a function of angle). The assumption in the current code (as I understand it) is that the center of the graph is `r==0`, however it would be good to be able to set the center to be at any `r` (with any value less than the offset clipped).

# MEP25: Serialization

</div>

## Status

This work is important, but this particular effort has stalled.

## Abstract

This MEP aims at adding a serializable `Controller` objects to act as an `Artist` managers. Users would then communicate changes to an `Artist` via a `Controller`. In this way, functionality of the `Controller` objects may be added incrementally since each `Artist` is still responsible for drawing everything. The goal is to create an API that is usable both by graphing libraries requiring high-level descriptions of figures and libraries requiring low-level interpretations.

## Detailed description

Matplotlib is a core plotting engine with an API that many users already understand. It's difficult/impossible for other graphing libraries to (1) get a complete figure description, (2) output raw data from the figure object as the user has provided it, (3) understand the semantics of the figure objects without heuristics, and (4) give matplotlib a complete figure description to visualize. In addition, because an `Artist` has no conception of its own semantics within the figure, it's difficult to interact with them in a natural way.

In this sense, matplotlib will adopt a standard Model-View-Controller (MVC) framework. The *Model* will be the user defined data, style, and semantics. The *Views* are the ensemble of each individual `Artist`, which are responsible for producing the final image based on the *model*. The *Controller* will be the `Controller` object managing its set of `Artist` objects.

The `Controller` must be able to export the information that it's carrying about the figure on command, perhaps via a `to_json` method or similar. Because it would be extremely extraneous to duplicate all of the information in the model with the controller, only user-specified information (data + style) are explicitly kept. If a user wants more information (defaults) from the view/model, it should be able to query for it.

  - This might be annoying to do, non-specified kwargs are pulled from the rcParams object which is in turn created from reading a user specified file and can be dynamically changed at run time. I suppose we could keep a dict of default defaults and compare against that. Not clear how this will interact with the style sheet \[\[MEP26\]\] - @tacaswell

Additional Notes:

  - The "raw data" does not necessarily need to be a `list`, `ndarray`, etc. Rather, it can more abstractly just have a method to yield data when needed.
  - Because the `Controller` will contain extra information that users may not want to keep around, it should *not* be created by default. You should be able to both (a) instantiate a `Controller` with a figure and (b) build a figure with a `Controller`.

Use Cases:

  - Export all necessary informat
  - Serializing a matplotlib figure, saving it, and being able to rerun later.
  - Any other source sending an appropriately formatted representation to matplotlib to open

## Examples

Here are some examples of what the controllers should be able to do.

1.  Instantiate a matplotlib figure from a serialized representation (e.g., JSON): :
    
        import json
        from matplotlib.controllers import Controller
        with open('my_figure') as f:
            o = json.load(f)
        c = Controller(o)
        fig = c.figure

2.  Manage artists from the controller (e.g., Line2D): :
    
        # not really sure how this should look
        c.axes[0].lines[0].color = 'b'
        # ?

3.  Export serializable figure representation: :
    
        o = c.to_json()
        # or... we should be able to throw a figure object in there too
        o = Controller.to_json(mpl_fig)

## Implementation

1.  Create base `Controller` objects that are able to manage `Artist` objects (e.g., `Hist`)
    
    Comments:
    
      - initialization should happen via unpacking `**`, so we need a copy of call signature parameter for the `Artist` we're ultimately trying to control. Unfortunate hard-coded repetition...
      - should the additional `**kwargs` accepted by each `Artist` be tracked at the `Controller`
      - how does a `Controller` know which artist belongs where? E.g., do we need to pass `axes` references?
    
    Progress:
    
      - A simple NB demonstrating some functionality for `Line2DController` objects: <https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/gist/theengineear/f0aa8d79f64325e767c0>

2.  Write in protocols for the `Controller` to *update* the model.
    
    Comments:
    
      - how should containers be dealt with? E.g., what happens to old patches when we re-bin a histogram?
      - in the link from (1), the old line is completely destroyed and redrawn, what if something is referencing it?

3.  Create method by which a json object can be assembled from the `Controllers`

4.  Deal with serializing the unserializable aspects of a figure (e.g., non-affine transforms?)

5.  Be able to instantiate from a serialized representation

6.  Reimplement the existing pyplot and Axes method, e.g. `pyplot.hist` and `Axes.hist` in terms of the new controller class.

\> @theengineer: in \#2 above, what do you mean by *get updates* from each `Artist`?

^ Yup. The `Controller` *shouldn't* need to get updated. This just happens in \#3. Delete comments when you see this.

## Backward compatibility

  - pickling will change
  - non-affine transformations will require a defined pickling method

## Alternatives

PR \#3150 suggested adding semantics by parasitically attaching extra containers to axes objects. This is a more complete solution with what should be a more developed/flexible/powerful framework.

# MEP26: Artist styling

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Rejected**

## Branches and Pull requests

## Abstract

This MEP proposes a new stylesheet implementation to allow more comprehensive and dynamic styling of artists.

The current version of matplotlib (1.4.0) allows stylesheets based on the rcParams syntax to be applied before creation of a plot. The methodology below proposes a new syntax, based on CSS, which would allow styling of individual artists and properties, which can be applied dynamically to existing objects.

This is related to (and makes steps toward) the overall goal of moving to a DOM/tree-like architecture.

## Detailed description

Currently, the look and appearance of existing artist objects (figure, axes, Line2D, etc.) can only be updated via `set_` and `get_` methods on the artist object, which is quite laborious, especially if no reference to the artist(s) has been stored. The new style sheets introduced in 1.4 allow styling before a plot is created, but do not offer any means to dynamically update plots or distinguish between artists of the same type (i.e. to specify the `line color` and `line style` separately for differing <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> objects).

The initial development should concentrate on allowing styling of artist primitives (those <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s that do not contain other <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s), and further development could expand the CSS syntax rules and parser to allow more complex styling. See the appendix for a list of primitives.

The new methodology would require development of a number of steps:

  - A new stylesheet syntax (likely based on CSS) to allow selection of artists by type, class, id, etc.
  - A mechanism by which to parse a stylesheet into a tree
  - A mechanism by which to translate the parse-tree into something which can be used to update the properties of relevant artists. Ideally this would implement a method by which to traverse the artists in a tree-like structure.
  - A mechanism by which to generate a stylesheet from existing artist properties. This would be useful to allow a user to export a stylesheet from an existing figure (where the appearance may have been set using the matplotlib API)...

## Implementation

It will be easiest to allow a '3rd party' to modify/set the style of an artist if the 'style' is created as a separate class and store against the artist as a property. The <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase</span> class already provides a the basis of a `Style` class and an artist's <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.draw</span> method can be refactored to use the `Style` class rather than setting up its own <span class="title-ref">.GraphicsContextBase</span> and transferring its style-related properties to it. A minimal example of how this could be implemented is shown here: <https://github.com/JamesRamm/mpl_experiment>

IMO, this will also make the API and code base much neater as individual get/set methods for artist style properties are now redundant... Indirectly related would be a general drive to replace get/set methods with properties. Implementing the style class with properties would be a big stride toward this...

For initial development, I suggest developing a syntax based on a much (much much) simplified version of CSS. I am in favour of dubbing this Artist Style Sheets :+1: :

### BNF Grammar

I propose a very simple syntax to implement initially (like a proof of concept), which can be expanded upon in the future. The BNF form of the syntax is given below and then explained :

    RuleSet ::= SelectorSequence "{"Declaration"}"
    
    SelectorSequence :: = Selector {"," Selector}
    
    Declaration ::= propName":" propValue";"
    
    Selector ::= ArtistIdent{"#"Ident}
    
    propName ::= Ident
    
    propValue ::= Ident | Number | Colour | "None"

`ArtistIdent`, `Ident`, `Number` and `Colour` are tokens (the basic building blocks of the expression) which are defined by regular expressions.

### Syntax

A CSS stylesheet consists of a series of **rule sets** in hierarchical order (rules are applied from top to bottom). Each rule follows the syntax :

    selector {attribute: value;}

Each rule can have any number of `attribute: value` pairs, and a stylesheet can have any number of rules.

The initial syntax is designed only for <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> primitives. It does not address the question of how to set properties on <span class="title-ref">.Container</span> types (whose properties may themselves be <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s with settable properties), however, a future solution to this could simply be nested `RuleSet`s

#### Selectors

Selectors define the object to which the attribute updates should be applied. As a starting point, I propose just 2 selectors to use in initial development:

Artist Type Selector

Select an <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> by it's type. E.g <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> or \`.Text\`:

    Line2D {attribute: value}

The regex for matching the artist type selector (`ArtistIdent` in the BNF grammar) would be:

    ArtistIdent = r'(?P<ArtistIdent>\bLine2D\b|\bText\b|\bAxesImage\b|\bFigureImage\b|\bPatch\b)'

#### GID selector

Select an <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> by its `gid`:

    Line2D#myGID {attribute: value}

A `gid` can be any string, so the regex could be as follows:

    Ident = r'(?P<Ident>[a-zA-Z_][a-zA-Z_0-9]*)'

The above selectors roughly correspond to their CSS counterparts (<http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/selector.html>)

#### Attributes and values

  - `Attributes` are any valid (settable) property for the <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> in question.
  - `Values` are any valid value for the property (Usually a string, or number).

### Parsing

Parsing would consist of breaking the stylesheet into tokens (the python cookbook gives a nice tokenizing recipe on page 66), applying the syntax rules and constructing a `Tree`. This requires defining the grammar of the stylesheet (again, we can borrow from CSS) and writing a parser. Happily, there is a recipe for this in the python cookbook as well.

### Visitor pattern for matplotlib figure

In order to apply the stylesheet rules to the relevant artists, we need to 'visit' each artist in a figure and apply the relevant rule. Here is a visitor class (again, thanks to python cookbook), where each `node` would be an artist in the figure. A `visit_` method would need to be implemented for each mpl artist, to handle the different properties for each :

    class Visitor:
        def visit(self, node):
           name = 'visit_' + type(node).__name__
           meth = getattr(self, name, None)
           if meth is None:
              raise NotImplementedError
           return meth(node)

An `evaluator` class would then take the stylesheet rules and implement the visitor on each one of them.

## Backward compatibility

Implementing a separate `Style` class would break backward compatibility as many get/set methods on an artist would become redundant. While it would be possible to alter these methods to hook into the `Style` class (stored as a property against the artist), I would be in favor of simply removing them to both neaten/simplify the codebase and to provide a simple, uncluttered API...

## Alternatives

No alternatives, but some of the ground covered here overlaps with MEP25, which may assist in this development

# MEP27: Decouple pyplot from backends

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

**Progress**

## Branches and Pull requests

Main PR (including GTK3):

  - <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/4143>

Backend specific branch diffs:

  - <https://github.com/OceanWolf/matplotlib/compare/backend-refactor>...OceanWolf:backend-refactor-tkagg

  - <https://github.com/OceanWolf/matplotlib/compare/backend-refactor>...backend-refactor-wx

## Abstract

This MEP refactors the backends to give a more structured and consistent API, removing generic code and consolidate existing code. To do this we propose splitting:

1.  `FigureManagerBase` and its derived classes into the core functionality class `FigureManager` and a backend specific class `WindowBase` and
2.  `ShowBase` and its derived classes into `Gcf.show_all` and `MainLoopBase`.

## Detailed description

This MEP aims to consolidate the backends API into one single uniform API, removing generic code out of the backend (which includes `_pylab_helpers` and `Gcf`), and push code to a more appropriate level in matplotlib. With this we automatically remove inconsistencies that appear in the backends, such as `FigureManagerBase.resize(w, h)` which sometimes sets the canvas, and other times set the entire window to the dimensions given, depending on the backend.

Two main places for generic code appear in the classes derived from `FigureManagerBase` and `ShowBase`.

1.  `FigureManagerBase` has **three** jobs at the moment:
    1.  The documentation describes it as a *Helper class for pyplot mode, wraps everything up into a neat bundle*
    2.  But it doesn't just wrap the canvas and toolbar, it also does all of the windowing tasks itself. The conflation of these two tasks gets seen the best in the following line: `self.set_window_title("Figure %d" % num)` This combines backend specific code `self.set_window_title(title)` with matplotlib generic code `title = "Figure %d" % num`.
    3.  Currently the backend specific subclass of `FigureManager` decides when to end the mainloop. This also seems very wrong as the figure should have no control over the other figures.
2.  `ShowBase` has two jobs:
    1.  It has the job of going through all figure managers registered in `_pylab_helpers.Gcf` and telling them to show themselves.
    2.  And secondly it has the job of performing the backend specific `mainloop` to block the main programme and thus keep the figures from dying.

## Implementation

The description of this MEP gives us most of the solution:

1.  To remove the windowing aspect out of `FigureManagerBase` letting it simply wrap this new class along with the other backend classes. Create a new `WindowBase` class that can handle this functionality, with pass-through methods (:arrow\_right:) to `WindowBase`. Classes that subclass `WindowBase` should also subclass the GUI specific window class to ensure backward compatibility (`manager.window == manager.window`).
2.  Refactor the mainloop of `ShowBase` into `MainLoopBase`, which encapsulates the end of the loop as well. We give an instance of `MainLoop` to `FigureManager` as a key unlock the exit method (requiring all keys returned before the loop can die). Note this opens the possibility for multiple backends to run concurrently.
3.  Now that `FigureManagerBase` has no backend specifics in it, to rename it to `FigureManager`, and move to a new file `backend_managers.py` noting that:
    1.  This allows us to break up the conversion of backends into separate PRs as we can keep the existing `FigureManagerBase` class and its dependencies intact.
    2.  And this also anticipates MEP22 where the new `NavigationBase` has morphed into a backend independent `ToolManager`.

## Future compatibility

As eluded to above when discussing MEP 22, this refactor makes it easy to add in new generic features. At the moment, MEP 22 has to make ugly hacks to each class extending from `FigureManagerBase`. With this code, this only needs to get made in the single `FigureManager` class. This also makes the later deprecation of `NavigationToolbar2` very straightforward, only needing to touch the single `FigureManager` class

MEP 23 makes for another use case where this refactored code will come in very handy.

## Backward compatibility

As we leave all backend code intact, only adding missing methods to existing classes, this should work seamlessly for all use cases. The only difference will lie for backends that used `FigureManager.resize` to resize the canvas and not the window, due to the standardisation of the API.

I would envision that the classes made obsolete by this refactor get deprecated and removed on the same timetable as `NavigationToolbar2`, also note that the change in call signature to the `FigureCanvasWx` constructor, while backward compatible, I think the old (imho ugly style) signature should get deprecated and removed in the same manner as everything else.

| Tk      | canvas              |                                                                            |

| Wx      | canvas              | FigureManagerWx had `frame` as an alias to window, so this also breaks BC. |

## Alternatives

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.

## Questions

Mdehoon: Can you elaborate on how to run multiple backends concurrently?

OceanWolf: @mdehoon, as I say, not for this MEP, but I see this MEP opens it up as a future possibility. Basically the `MainLoopBase` class acts a per backend Gcf, in this MEP it tracks the number of figures open per backend, and manages the mainloops for those backends. It closes the backend specific mainloop when it detects that no figures remain open for that backend. Because of this I imagine that with only a small amount of tweaking that we can do full-multi-backend matplotlib. No idea yet why one would want to, but I leave the possibility there in MainLoopBase. With all the backend-code specifics refactored out of `FigureManager` also aids in this, one manager to rule them (the backends) all.

Mdehoon: @OceanWolf, OK, thanks for the explanation. Having a uniform API for the backends is very important for the maintainability of matplotlib. I think this MEP is a step in the right direction.

## Abstract

Over the past few releases, the `Axes.boxplot` method has grown in complexity to support fully customizable artist styling and statistical computation. This lead to `Axes.boxplot` being split off into multiple parts. The statistics needed to draw a boxplot are computed in `cbook.boxplot_stats`, while the actual artists are drawn by `Axes.bxp`. The original method, `Axes.boxplot` remains as the most public API that handles passing the user-supplied data to `cbook.boxplot_stats`, feeding the results to `Axes.bxp`, and pre-processing style information for each facet of the boxplot plots.

This MEP will outline a path forward to rollback the added complexity and simplify the API while maintaining reasonable backwards compatibility.

## Detailed description

Currently, the `Axes.boxplot` method accepts parameters that allow the users to specify medians and confidence intervals for each box that will be drawn in the plot. These were provided so that advanced users could provide statistics computed in a different fashion that the simple method provided by matplotlib. However, handling this input requires complex logic to make sure that the forms of the data structure match what needs to be drawn. At the moment, that logic contains 9 separate if/else statements nested up to 5 levels deep with a for loop, and may raise up to 2 errors. These parameters were added prior to the creation of the `Axes.bxp` method, which draws boxplots from a list of dictionaries containing the relevant statistics. Matplotlib also provides a function that computes these statistics via `cbook.boxplot_stats`. Note that advanced users can now either a) write their own function to compute the stats required by `Axes.bxp`, or b) modify the output returned by `cbook.boxplots_stats` to fully customize the position of the artists of the plots. With this flexibility, the parameters to manually specify only the medians and their confidences intervals remain for backwards compatibility.

Around the same time that the two roles of `Axes.boxplot` were split into `cbook.boxplot_stats` for computation and `Axes.bxp` for drawing, both `Axes.boxplot` and `Axes.bxp` were written to accept parameters that individually toggle the drawing of all components of the boxplots, and parameters that individually configure the style of those artists. However, to maintain backwards compatibility, the `sym` parameter (previously used to specify the symbol of the fliers) was retained. This parameter itself requires fairly complex logic to reconcile the `sym` parameters with the newer `flierprops` parameter at the default style specified by `matplotlibrc`.

This MEP seeks to dramatically simplify the creation of boxplots for novice and advanced users alike. Importantly, the changes proposed here will also be available to downstream packages like seaborn, as seaborn smartly allows users to pass arbitrary dictionaries of parameters through the seaborn API to the underlying matplotlib functions.

This will be achieved in the following way:

1.  `cbook.boxplot_stats` will be modified to allow pre- and post-computation transformation functions to be passed in (e.g., `np.log` and `np.exp` for lognormally distributed data)
2.  `Axes.boxplot` will be modified to also accept and naïvely pass them to `cbook.boxplots_stats` (Alt: pass the stat function and a dict of its optional parameters).
3.  Outdated parameters from `Axes.boxplot` will be deprecated and later removed.

### Importance

Since the limits of the whiskers are computed arithmetically, there is an implicit assumption of normality in box and whisker plots. This primarily affects which data points are classified as outliers.

Allowing transformations to the data and the results used to draw boxplots will allow users to opt-out of that assumption if the data are known to not fit a normal distribution.

Below is an example of how `Axes.boxplot` classifies outliers of lognormal data differently depending one these types of transforms.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib import cbook np.random.seed(0)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 6)) ax.set\_yscale('log') data = np.random.lognormal(-1.75, 2.75, size=37)

stats = cbook.boxplot\_stats(data, labels=\['arithmetic'\]) logstats = cbook.boxplot\_stats(np.log(data), labels=\['log-transformed'\])

  - for lsdict in logstats:
    
      - for key, value in lsdict.items():
        
          - if key \!= 'label':  
            lsdict\[key\] = np.exp(value)

stats.extend(logstats) ax.bxp(stats) fig.show()

</div>

## Implementation

### Passing transform functions to `cbook.boxplots_stats`

This MEP proposes that two parameters (e.g., `transform_in` and `transform_out` be added to the cookbook function that computes the statistics for the boxplot function. These will be optional keyword-only arguments and can easily be set to `lambda x: x` as a no-op when omitted by the user. The `transform_in` function will be applied to the data as the `boxplot_stats` function loops through each subset of the data passed to it. After the list of statistics dictionaries are computed the `transform_out` function is applied to each value in the dictionaries.

These transformations can then be added to the call signature of `Axes.boxplot` with little impact to that method's complexity. This is because they can be directly passed to `cbook.boxplot_stats`. Alternatively, `Axes.boxplot` could be modified to accept an optional statistical function kwarg and a dictionary of parameters to be directly passed to it.

At this point in the implementation users and external libraries like seaborn would have complete control via the `Axes.boxplot` method. More importantly, at the very least, seaborn would require no changes to its API to allow users to take advantage of these new options.

### Simplifications to the `Axes.boxplot` API and other functions

Simplifying the boxplot method consists primarily of deprecating and then removing the redundant parameters. Optionally, a next step would include rectifying minor terminological inconsistencies between `Axes.boxplot` and `Axes.bxp`.

The parameters to be deprecated and removed include:

1.  `usermedians` - processed by 10 SLOC, 3 `if` blocks, a `for` loop
2.  `conf_intervals` - handled by 15 SLOC, 6 `if` blocks, a `for` loop
3.  `sym` - processed by 12 SLOC, 4 `if` blocks

Removing the `sym` option allows all code in handling the remaining styling parameters to be moved to `Axes.bxp`. This doesn't remove any complexity, but does reinforce the single responsibility principle among `Axes.bxp`, `cbook.boxplot_stats`, and `Axes.boxplot`.

Additionally, the `notch` parameter could be renamed `shownotches` to be consistent with `Axes.bxp`. This kind of cleanup could be taken a step further and the `whis`, `bootstrap`, `autorange` could be rolled into the kwargs passed to the new `statfxn` parameter.

## Backward compatibility

Implementation of this MEP would eventually result in the backwards incompatible deprecation and then removal of the keyword parameters `usermedians`, `conf_intervals`, and `sym`. Cursory searches on GitHub indicated that `usermedians`, `conf_intervals` are used by few users, who all seem to have a very strong knowledge of matplotlib. A robust deprecation cycle should provide sufficient time for these users to migrate to a new API.

Deprecation of `sym` however, may have a much broader reach into the matplotlib userbase.

### Schedule

An accelerated timeline could look like the following:

1.  v2.0.1 add transforms to `cbook.boxplots_stats`, expose in `Axes.boxplot`
2.  v2.1.0 Initial Deprecations , and using 2D NumPy arrays as input
    1.  Using 2D NumPy arrays as input. The semantics around 2D arrays are generally confusing.
    2.  `usermedians`, `conf_intervals`, `sym` parameters
3.  v2.2.0
    1.  remove `usermedians`, `conf_intervals`, `sym` parameters
    2.  deprecate `notch` in favor of `shownotches` to be consistent with other parameters and `Axes.bxp`
4.  v2.3.0
    1.  remove `notch` parameter
    2.  move all style and artist toggling logic to `Axes.bxp` such `Axes.boxplot` is little more than a broker between `Axes.bxp` and `cbook.boxplots_stats`

### Anticipated Impacts to Users

As described above deprecating `usermedians` and `conf_intervals` will likely impact few users. Those who will be impacted are almost certainly advanced users who will be able to adapt to the change.

Deprecating the `sym` option may import more users and effort should be taken to collect community feedback on this.

### Anticipated Impacts to Downstream Libraries

The source code (GitHub master as of 2016-10-17) was inspected for seaborn and python-ggplot to see if these changes would impact their use. None of the parameters nominated for removal in this MEP are used by seaborn. The seaborn APIs that use matplotlib's boxplot function allow user's to pass arbitrary `**kwargs` through to matplotlib's API. Thus seaborn users with modern matplotlib installations will be able to take full advantage of any new features added as a result of this MEP.

Python-ggplot has implemented its own function to draw boxplots. Therefore, no impact can come to it as a result of implementing this MEP.

## Alternatives

### Variations on the theme

This MEP can be divided into a few loosely coupled components:

1.  Allowing pre- and post-computation transformation function in `cbook.boxplot_stats`
2.  Exposing that transformation in the `Axes.boxplot` API
3.  Removing redundant statistical options in `Axes.boxplot`
4.  Shifting all styling parameter processing from `Axes.boxplot` to `Axes.bxp`.

With this approach, \#2 depends and \#1, and \#4 depends on \#3.

There are two possible approaches to \#2. The first and most direct would be to mirror the new `transform_in` and `transform_out` parameters of `cbook.boxplot_stats` in `Axes.boxplot` and pass them directly.

The second approach would be to add `statfxn` and `statfxn_args` parameters to `Axes.boxplot`. Under this implementation, the default value of `statfxn` would be `cbook.boxplot_stats`, but users could pass their own function. Then `transform_in` and `transform_out` would then be passed as elements of the `statfxn_args` parameter.

``` python
def boxplot_stats(data, ..., transform_in=None, transform_out=None):
    if transform_in is None:
        transform_in = lambda x: x

    if transform_out is None:
        transform_out = lambda x: x

    output = []
    for _d in data:
        d = transform_in(_d)
        stat_dict = do_stats(d)
        for key, value in stat_dict.item():
            if key != 'label':
                stat_dict[key] = transform_out(value)
        output.append(d)
    return output

 class Axes(...):
     def boxplot_option1(data, ..., transform_in=None, transform_out=None):
         stats = cbook.boxplot_stats(data, ...,
                                     transform_in=transform_in,
                                     transform_out=transform_out)
         return self.bxp(stats, ...)

     def boxplot_option2(data, ..., statfxn=None, **statopts):
         if statfxn is None:
             statfxn = boxplot_stats
         stats = statfxn(data, **statopts)
         return self.bxp(stats, ...)
```

Both cases would allow users to do the following:

``` python
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
artists1 = ax1.boxplot_optionX(data, transform_in=np.log,
                               transform_out=np.exp)
```

But Option Two lets a user write a completely custom stat function (e.g., `my_box_stats`) with fancy BCA confidence intervals and the whiskers set differently depending on some attribute of the data.

This is available under the current API:

``` python
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
my_stats = my_box_stats(data, bootstrap_method='BCA',
                        whisker_method='dynamic')
ax1.bxp(my_stats)
```

And would be more concise with Option Two

``` python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
statopts = dict(transform_in=np.log, transform_out=np.exp)
ax.boxplot(data, ..., **statopts)
```

Users could also pass their own function to compute the stats:

``` python
fig, ax1 = plt.subplots()
ax1.boxplot(data, statfxn=my_box_stats, bootstrap_method='BCA',
            whisker_method='dynamic')
```

From the examples above, Option Two seems to have only marginal benefit, but in the context of downstream libraries like seaborn, its advantage is more apparent as the following would be possible without any patches to seaborn:

``` python
import seaborn
tips = seaborn.load_data('tips')
g = seaborn.factorplot(x="day", y="total_bill", hue="sex", data=tips,
                       kind='box', palette="PRGn", shownotches=True,
                       statfxn=my_box_stats, bootstrap_method='BCA',
                       whisker_method='dynamic')
```

This type of flexibility was the intention behind splitting the overall boxplot API in the current three functions. In practice however, downstream libraries like seaborn support versions of matplotlib dating back well before the split. Thus, adding just a bit more flexibility to the `Axes.boxplot` could expose all the functionality to users of the downstream libraries with modern matplotlib installation without intervention from the downstream library maintainers.

### Doing less

Another obvious alternative would be to omit the added pre- and post-computation transform functionality in `cbook.boxplot_stats` and `Axes.boxplot`, and simply remove the redundant statistical and style parameters as described above.

### Doing nothing

As with many things in life, doing nothing is an option here. This means we simply advocate for users and downstream libraries to take advantage of the split between `cbook.boxplot_stats` and `Axes.bxp` and let them decide how to provide an interface to that.

# MEP29: Text light markup

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Status

Discussion

## Branches and Pull requests

None at the moment, proof of concept only.

## Abstract

This MEP proposes to add lightweight markup to the text artist.

## Detailed description

Using different size/color/family in a text annotation is difficult because the <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.text</span> method accepts argument for size/color/family/weight/etc. that are used for the whole text. But, if one wants, for example, to have different colors, one has to look at the gallery where one such example is provided: \[/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/rainbow\_text\](/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/rainbow\_text.md)

This example takes a list of strings as well as a list of colors which makes it cumbersome to use. An alternative would be to use a restricted set of [pango](https://docs.gtk.org/Pango/pango_markup.html#pango-markup)-like markup and to interpret this markup.

Some markup examples:

    Hello <b>world!</b>`
    Hello <span color="blue">world!</span>

## Implementation

A proof of concept is provided in [markup\_example.py](https://github.com/rougier/matplotlib/blob/markup/examples/text_labels_and_annotations/markup.py) but it currently only handles the horizontal direction.

### Improvements

  - This proof of concept uses regex to parse the text but it may be better to use the html.parser from the standard library.
  - Computation of text fragment positions could benefit from the OffsetFrom class. See for example item 5 in [Using Complex Coordinates with Annotations](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/users/explain/text/annotations.html#using-complex-coordinates-with-annotations)

### Problems

  - One serious problem is how to deal with text having both LaTeX and HTML-like tags. For example, consider the following:
    
        $<b>Bold$</b>
    
    Recommendation would be to have mutual exclusion.

## Backward compatibility

None at the moment since it is only a proof of concept

## Alternatives

As proposed by @anntzer, this could be also implemented as improvements to mathtext. For example:

    r"$\text{Hello \textbf{world}}$"
    r"$\text{Hello \textcolor{blue}{world}}$"
    r"$\text{Hello \textsf{\small world}}$"

# Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals

Matplotlib Enhancement Proposals (MEP), inspired by cpython's [PEP's](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/) but less formal, are design documents for large or controversial changes to Matplotilb. These documents should provide a discussion of both why and how the changes should be made.

To create a new MEP open a pull request (PR) adding a file based on \[the template \<MEP-template\>\](\#the-template-\<mep-template\>) to this the MEP directory. For the initial PR only a rough description is required and it should be merged quickly. Further detailed discussion can happen in follow on PRs.

# MEP Template

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

This MEP template is a guideline of the sections that a MEP should contain. Extra sections may be added if appropriate, and unnecessary sections may be noted as such.

## Status

MEPs go through a number of phases in their lifetime:

  - **Discussion**: The MEP is being actively discussed on the mailing list and it is being improved by its author. The mailing list discussion of the MEP should include the MEP number (MEPxxx) in the subject line so they can be easily related to the MEP.
  - **Progress**: Consensus was reached and implementation work has begun.
  - **Completed**: The implementation has been merged into main.
  - **Superseded**: This MEP has been abandoned in favor of another approach.
  - **Rejected**: There are currently no plans to implement the proposal.

## Branches and Pull requests

All development branches containing work on this MEP should be linked to from here.

All pull requests submitted relating to this MEP should be linked to from here. (A MEP does not need to be implemented in a single pull request if it makes sense to implement it in discrete phases).

## Abstract

The abstract should be a short description of what the MEP will achieve.

## Detailed description

This section describes the need for the MEP. It should describe the existing problem that it is trying to solve and why this MEP makes the situation better. It should include examples of how the new functionality would be used and perhaps some use cases.

## Implementation

This section lists the major steps required to implement the MEP. Where possible, it should be noted where one step is dependent on another, and which steps may be optionally omitted. Where it makes sense, each step should include a link related pull requests as the implementation progresses.

## Backward compatibility

This section describes the ways in which the MEP breaks backward incompatibility.

## Alternatives

If there were any alternative solutions to solving the same problem, they should be discussed here, along with a justification for the chosen approach.

# API guidelines

API consistency and stability are of great value; Therefore, API changes (e.g. signature changes, behavior changes, removals) will only be conducted if the added benefit is worth the effort of adapting existing code.

Because we are a visualization library, our primary output is the final visualization the user sees; therefore, the appearance of the figure is part of the API and any changes, either semantic or aesthetic, are backwards-incompatible API changes.

## Add new API and features

Every new function, parameter and attribute that is not explicitly marked as private (i.e., starts with an underscore) becomes part of Matplotlib's public API. As discussed above, changing the existing API is cumbersome. Therefore, take particular care when adding new API:

  - Mark helper functions and internal attributes as private by prefixing them with an underscore.

  - Carefully think about good names for your functions and variables.

  - Try to adopt patterns and naming conventions from existing parts of the Matplotlib API.

  - Consider making as many arguments keyword-only as possible. See also <span class="title-ref">API Evolution the Right Way -- Add Parameters Compatibly</span>\_\_.
    
    \_\_ <https://emptysqua.re/blog/api-evolution-the-right-way/#adding-parameters>

## Add or change colormaps, color sequences, and styles

Visual changes are considered an API break. Therefore, we generally do not modify existing colormaps, color sequences, or styles.

We put a high bar on adding new colormaps and styles to prevent excessively growing them. While the decision is case-by-case, evaluation criteria include:

  - novelty: Does it support a new use case? e.g. slight variations of existing maps, sequences and styles are likely not accepted.
  - usability and accessibility: Are colors of sequences sufficiently distinct? Has colorblindness been considered?
  - evidence of wide spread usage: for example academic papers, industry blogs and whitepapers, or inclusion in other visualization libraries or domain specific tools
  - open license: colormaps, sequences, and styles must have a BSD compatible license (see \[license-discussion\](\#license-discussion))

## Deprecate API

API changes in Matplotlib have to be performed following the deprecation process below, except in very rare circumstances as deemed necessary by the development team. Generally API deprecation happens in two stages:

  - **introduce:** warn users that the API *will* change
  - **expire:** API *is* changed as described in the introduction period

This ensures that users are notified before the change will take effect and thus prevents unexpected breaking of code.

### Rules

  - Deprecations are targeted at the next \[meso release \<pr-milestones\>\](\#meso-release-\<pr-milestones\>) (e.g. 3.x)
  - Deprecated API is generally removed (expired) two point-releases after introduction of the deprecation. Longer deprecations can be imposed by core developers on a case-by-case basis to give more time for the transition
  - The old API must remain fully functional during the deprecation period
  - If alternatives to the deprecated API exist, they should be available during the deprecation period
  - If in doubt, decisions about API changes are finally made by the [API consistency lead](https://matplotlib.org/governance/people.html) developer.

### Introduce deprecation

1.  Create \[deprecation notice \<api\_whats\_new\>\](\#deprecation-notice-\<api\_whats\_new\>)

2.  If possible, issue a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.MatplotlibDeprecationWarning</span> when the deprecated API is used. There are a number of helper tools for this:
    
      - Use `_api.warn_deprecated()` for general deprecation warnings
      - Use the decorator `@_api.deprecated` to deprecate classes, functions, methods, or properties
      - Use `@_api.deprecate_privatize_attribute` to annotate deprecation of attributes while keeping the internal private version.
      - To warn on changes of the function signature, use the decorators `@_api.delete_parameter`, `@_api.rename_parameter`, and `@_api.make_keyword_only`
    
    All these helpers take a first parameter *since*, which should be set to the next point release, e.g. "3.x".
    
    You can use standard rst cross references in *alternative*.

3.  Make appropriate changes to the type hints in the associated `.pyi` file. The general guideline is to match runtime reported behavior.
    
      - Items marked with `@_api.deprecated` or `@_api.deprecate_privatize_attribute` are generally kept during the expiry period, and thus no changes are needed on introduction.
      - Items decorated with `@_api.rename_parameter` or `@_api.make_keyword_only` report the *new* (post deprecation) signature at runtime, and thus *should* be updated on introduction.
      - Items decorated with `@_api.delete_parameter` should include a default value hint for the deleted parameter, even if it did not previously have one (e.g. `param: <type> = ...`).

### Expire deprecation

1.  Create \[deprecation announcement \<api\_whats\_new\>\](\#deprecation-announcement-\<api\_whats\_new\>). For the content, you can usually copy the deprecation notice and adapt it slightly.
2.  Change the code functionality and remove any related deprecation warnings.
3.  Make appropriate changes to the type hints in the associated `.pyi` file.
      - Items marked with `@_api.deprecated` or `@_api.deprecate_privatize_attribute` are to be removed on expiry.
      - Items decorated with `@_api.rename_parameter` or `@_api.make_keyword_only` will have been updated at introduction, and require no change now.
      - Items decorated with `@_api.delete_parameter` will need to be updated to the final signature, in the same way as the `.py` file signature is updated.
      - Any entries in `ci/mypy-stubtest-allowlist.txt` which indicate a deprecation version should be double checked. In most cases this is not needed, though some items were never type hinted in the first place and were added to this file instead. For removed items that were not in the stub file, only deleting from the allowlist is required.

<div class="redirect-from">

/devel/coding\_guide\#new-features-and-api-changes

</div>

## Announce new and deprecated API

When adding or changing the API in a backward in-compatible way, please add the appropriate \[versioning directive \<versioning-directives\>\](\#versioning-directive-\<versioning-directives\>) and document it for the release notes and add the entry to the appropriate folder:

|             | versioning directive      | announcement folder               |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| new feature | `.. versionadded:: 3.N`   | `doc/users/next_whats_new/`       |
| API change  | `.. versionchanged:: 3.N` | `doc/api/next_api_changes/[kind]` |

When deprecating API, please add a notice as described in the \[deprecation guidelines \<deprecation-guidelines\>\](\#deprecation-guidelines-\<deprecation-guidelines\>) and summarized here:

\+--------------------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+ | stage | announcement folder | +===========+======================================+==============================================+ | \[introduce deprecation \<intro-deprecation\>\](\#introduce-deprecation-\<intro-deprecation\>) | `doc/api/next_api_changes/deprecation` | +-----------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+ | \[expire deprecation \<expire-deprecation\>\](\#expire-deprecation-\<expire-deprecation\>) | `doc/api/next_api_changes/[kind]` | +-----------+--------------------------------------+----------------------------------------------+

Generally the introduction notices can be repurposed for the expiration notice as they are expected to be describing the same API changes and removals.

### Versioning directives

When making a backward incompatible change, please add a versioning directive in the docstring. The directives should be placed at the end of a description block. For example:

    class Foo:
        """
        This is the summary.
    
        Followed by a longer description block.
    
        Consisting of multiple lines and paragraphs.
    
        .. versionadded:: 3.5
    
        Parameters
        ----------
        a : int
            The first parameter.
        b: bool, default: False
            This was added later.
    
            .. versionadded:: 3.6
        """
    
        def set_b(b):
            """
            Set b.
    
            .. versionadded:: 3.6
    
            Parameters
            ----------
            b: bool

For classes and functions, the directive should be placed before the *Parameters* section. For parameters, the directive should be placed at the end of the parameter description. The micro release version is omitted and the directive should not be added to entire modules.

### Release notes

For both change notes and what's new, please avoid using cross-references in section titles as it causes links to be confusing in the table of contents. Instead, ensure that a cross-reference is included in the descriptive text.

#### API change notes

  - orphan

# Adding API change notes

API change notes for future releases are collected in `doc/api/next_api_changes/`. They are divided into four subdirectories:

  - **Deprecations**: Announcements of future changes. Typically, these will raise a deprecation warning and users of this API should change their code to stay compatible with future releases of Matplotlib. If possible, state what should be used instead.
  - **Removals**: Parts of the API that got removed. If possible, state what should be used instead.
  - **Behaviour changes**: API that stays valid but will yield a different result.
  - **Development changes**: Changes to the build process, dependencies, etc.

Please place new entries in these directories with a new file named `99999-ABC.rst`, where `99999` would be the PR number, and `ABC` the author's initials. Typically, each change will get its own file, but you may also amend existing files when suitable. The overall goal is a comprehensible documentation of the changes.

A typical entry could look like this:

    Locators
    ~~~~~~~~
    The unused `Locator.autoscale()` method is deprecated (pass the axis
    limits to `Locator.view_limits()` instead).

Please avoid using references in section titles, as it causes links to be confusing in the table of contents. Instead, ensure that a reference is included in the descriptive text.

#### What's new notes

  - orphan

# Instructions for writing "What's new" entries

Please place new portions of `whats_new.rst` in the `doc/users/next_whats_new/` directory.

When adding an entry please look at the currently existing files to see if you can extend any of them. If you create a file, name it something like `cool_new_feature.rst` if you have added a brand new feature or something like `updated_feature.rst` for extensions of existing features.

Include contents of the form:

    Section title for feature
    -------------------------
    
    A bunch of text about how awesome the new feature is and examples of how
    to use it.
    
    A sub-section
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please avoid using references in section titles, as it causes links to be confusing in the table of contents. Instead, ensure that a reference is included in the descriptive text.

## Discourage API

We have API that we do not recommend anymore for new code, but that cannot be deprecated because its removal would be breaking backward-compatibility and too disruptive. In such a case we can formally discourage API. This can cover specific parameters, call patterns, whole methods etc.

To do so, add a note to the docstring :

    .. admonition:: Discouraged
    
       [description and suggested alternative]

You find several examples for good descriptions if you search the codebase for `.. admonition:: Discouraged`.

# Coding guidelines

We appreciate these guidelines being followed because it improves the readability, consistency, and maintainability of the code base.

<div class="admonition seealso">

API guidelines

If adding new features, changing behavior or function signatures, or removing public interfaces, please consult the \[api\_changes\](\#api\_changes).

</div>

## PEP8, as enforced by flake8

Formatting should follow the recommendations of [PEP8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), as enforced by [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/). Matplotlib modifies PEP8 to extend the maximum line length to 88 characters. You can check flake8 compliance from the command line with :

    python -m pip install flake8
    flake8 /path/to/module.py

or your editor may provide integration with it. Note that Matplotlib intentionally does not use the [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/) auto-formatter ([1](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/18796)), in particular due to its inability to understand the semantics of mathematical expressions ([2](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/148), [3](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/1984)).

## Package imports

Import the following modules using the standard scipy conventions:

    import numpy as np
    import numpy.ma as ma
    import matplotlib as mpl
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
    import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

In general, Matplotlib modules should **not** import <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span> using `from matplotlib import rcParams`, but rather access it as `mpl.rcParams`. This is because some modules are imported very early, before the <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span> singleton is constructed.

## Variable names

When feasible, please use our internal variable naming convention for objects of a given class and objects of any child class:

\+------------------------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------+ | base class | variable | multiples | +====================================+===============+==========================================+ | <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.FigureBase</span> | `fig` | | +------------------------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------+ | <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> | `ax` | | +------------------------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------+ | <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Transform</span> | `trans` | `trans_<source>_<target>` | + + + + | | | `trans_<source>` when target is screen | +------------------------------------+---------------+------------------------------------------+

Generally, denote more than one instance of the same class by adding suffixes to the variable names. If a format isn't specified in the table, use numbers or letters as appropriate.

## Type hints

If you add new public API or change public API, update or add the corresponding [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) type hints. We generally use [stub files](https://typing.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/stubs.html#type-stubs) (`*.pyi`) to store the type information; for example `colors.pyi` contains the type information for `colors.py`. A notable exception is `pyplot.py`, which is type hinted inline.

Type hints can be validated by the [stubtest](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/stubtest.html) tool, which can be run locally using `tox -e stubtest` and is a part of the \[automated-tests\](\#automated-tests) suite. Type hints for existing functions are also checked by the mypy \[pre-commit hook \<pre-commit-hooks\>\](\#pre-commit-hook-\<pre-commit-hooks\>).

## New modules and files: installation

  - If you have added new files or directories, or reorganized existing ones, make sure the new files are included in the `meson.build` in the corresponding directories.
  - New modules *may* be typed inline or using parallel stub file like existing modules.

## C/C++ extensions

  - Extensions may be written in C or C++.
  - Code style should conform to PEP7 (understanding that PEP7 doesn't address C++, but most of its admonitions still apply).
  - Python/C interface code should be kept separate from the core C/C++ code. The interface code should be named `FOO_wrap.cpp` or `FOO_wrapper.cpp`.
  - Header file documentation (aka docstrings) should be in Numpydoc format. We don't plan on using automated tools for these docstrings, and the Numpydoc format is well understood in the scientific Python community.
  - C/C++ code in the `extern/` directory is vendored, and should be kept close to upstream whenever possible. It can be modified to fix bugs or implement new features only if the required changes cannot be made elsewhere in the codebase. In particular, avoid making style fixes to it.

## Keyword argument processing

Matplotlib makes extensive use of `**kwargs` for pass-through customizations from one function to another. A typical example is <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.text</span>. The definition of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.text</span> is a simple pass-through to \`matplotlib.axes.Axes.text\`:

    # in pyplot.py
    def text(x, y, s, fontdict=None, **kwargs):
        return gca().text(x, y, s, fontdict=fontdict, **kwargs)

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.text</span> (simplified for illustration) just passes all `args` and `kwargs` on to `matplotlib.text.Text.__init__`:

    # in axes/_axes.py
    def text(self, x, y, s, fontdict=None, **kwargs):
        t = Text(x=x, y=y, text=s, **kwargs)

and `matplotlib.text.Text.__init__` (again, simplified) just passes them on to the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.update</span> method:

    # in text.py
    def __init__(self, x=0, y=0, text='', **kwargs):
        super().__init__()
        self.update(kwargs)

`update` does the work looking for methods named like `set_property` if `property` is a keyword argument. i.e., no one looks at the keywords, they just get passed through the API to the artist constructor which looks for suitably named methods and calls them with the value.

As a general rule, the use of `**kwargs` should be reserved for pass-through keyword arguments, as in the example above. If all the keyword args are to be used in the function, and not passed on, use the key/value keyword args in the function definition rather than the `**kwargs` idiom.

In some cases, you may want to consume some keys in the local function, and let others pass through. Instead of popping arguments to use off `**kwargs`, specify them as keyword-only arguments to the local function. This makes it obvious at a glance which arguments will be consumed in the function. For example, in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>, `scalex` and `scaley` are local arguments and the rest are passed on as <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> keyword arguments:

    # in axes/_axes.py
    def plot(self, *args, scalex=True, scaley=True, **kwargs):
        lines = []
        for line in self._get_lines(*args, **kwargs):
            self.add_line(line)
            lines.append(line)

## Using logging for debug messages

Matplotlib uses the standard Python <span class="title-ref">logging</span> library to write verbose warnings, information, and debug messages. Please use it\! In all those places you write <span class="title-ref">print</span> calls to do your debugging, try using <span class="title-ref">logging.debug</span> instead\!

To include <span class="title-ref">logging</span> in your module, at the top of the module, you need to `import logging`. Then calls in your code like:

    _log = logging.getLogger(__name__)  # right after the imports
    
    # code
    # more code
    _log.info('Here is some information')
    _log.debug('Here is some more detailed information')

will log to a logger named `matplotlib.yourmodulename`.

If an end-user of Matplotlib sets up <span class="title-ref">logging</span> to display at levels more verbose than `logging.WARNING` in their code with the Matplotlib-provided helper:

    plt.set_loglevel("debug")

or manually with :

    import logging
    logging.basicConfig(level=logging.DEBUG)
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

Then they will receive messages like

`` `none    DEBUG:matplotlib.backends:backend MacOSX version unknown    DEBUG:matplotlib.yourmodulename:Here is some information    DEBUG:matplotlib.yourmodulename:Here is some more detailed information  Avoid using pre-computed strings ( ``f-strings`,`str.format`,etc.) for logging because`<span class="title-ref"> of security and performance issues, and because they interfere with style handlers. For example, use </span><span class="title-ref">\_log.error('hello %s', 'world')</span><span class="title-ref"> rather than </span><span class="title-ref">\_log.error('hello {}'.format('world'))</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">\_log.error(f'hello {s}')</span>\`.

### Which logging level to use?

There are five levels at which you can emit messages.

  - <span class="title-ref">logging.critical</span> and <span class="title-ref">logging.error</span> are really only there for errors that will end the use of the library but not kill the interpreter.
  - <span class="title-ref">logging.warning</span> and <span class="title-ref">.\_api.warn\_external</span> are used to warn the user, see below.
  - <span class="title-ref">logging.info</span> is for information that the user may want to know if the program behaves oddly. They are not displayed by default. For instance, if an object isn't drawn because its position is `NaN`, that can usually be ignored, but a mystified user could call `logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)` and get an error message that says why.
  - <span class="title-ref">logging.debug</span> is the least likely to be displayed, and hence can be the most verbose. "Expected" code paths (e.g., reporting normal intermediate steps of layouting or rendering) should only log at this level.

By default, <span class="title-ref">logging</span> displays all log messages at levels higher than `logging.WARNING` to <span class="title-ref">sys.stderr</span>.

The [logging tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html#logging-basic-tutorial) suggests that the difference between <span class="title-ref">logging.warning</span> and <span class="title-ref">.\_api.warn\_external</span> (which uses <span class="title-ref">warnings.warn</span>) is that <span class="title-ref">.\_api.warn\_external</span> should be used for things the user must change to stop the warning (typically in the source), whereas <span class="title-ref">logging.warning</span> can be more persistent. Moreover, note that <span class="title-ref">.\_api.warn\_external</span> will by default only emit a given warning *once* for each line of user code, whereas <span class="title-ref">logging.warning</span> will display the message every time it is called.

By default, <span class="title-ref">warnings.warn</span> displays the line of code that has the `warn` call. This usually isn't more informative than the warning message itself. Therefore, Matplotlib uses <span class="title-ref">.\_api.warn\_external</span> which uses <span class="title-ref">warnings.warn</span>, but goes up the stack and displays the first line of code outside of Matplotlib. For example, for the module:

    # in my_matplotlib_module.py
    import warnings
    
    def set_range(bottom, top):
        if bottom == top:
            warnings.warn('Attempting to set identical bottom==top')

running the script:

    from matplotlib import my_matplotlib_module
    my_matplotlib_module.set_range(0, 0)  # set range

will display

`` `none     UserWarning: Attempting to set identical bottom==top     warnings.warn('Attempting to set identical bottom==top')  Modifying the module to use `._api.warn_external`::      from matplotlib import _api      def set_range(bottom, top):         if bottom == top:             _api.warn_external('Attempting to set identical bottom==top')  and running the same script will display  .. code-block:: none     UserWarning: Attempting to set identical bottom==top    my_matplotlib_module.set_range(0, 0)  # set range     .. _licence-coding-guide:  .. _license-discussion:  Licenses for contributed code ``\` =============================

Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code. If you bring in code from another project make sure it has a PSF, BSD, MIT or compatible license (see the Open Source Initiative [licenses page](https://opensource.org/licenses) for details on individual licenses). If it doesn't, you may consider contacting the author and asking them to relicense it. GPL and LGPL code are not acceptable in the main code base, though we are considering an alternative way of distributing L/GPL code through an separate channel, possibly a toolkit. If you include code, make sure you include a copy of that code's license in the license directory if the code's license requires you to distribute the license with it. Non-BSD compatible licenses are acceptable in Matplotlib toolkits (e.g., basemap), but make sure you clearly state the licenses you are using.

### Why BSD compatible?

The two dominant license variants in the wild are GPL-style and BSD-style. There are countless other licenses that place specific restrictions on code reuse, but there is an important difference to be considered in the GPL and BSD variants. The best known and perhaps most widely used license is the GPL, which in addition to granting you full rights to the source code including redistribution, carries with it an extra obligation. If you use GPL code in your own code, or link with it, your product must be released under a GPL compatible license. i.e., you are required to give the source code to other people and give them the right to redistribute it as well. Many of the most famous and widely used open source projects are released under the GPL, including linux, gcc, emacs and sage.

The second major class are the BSD-style licenses (which includes MIT and the python PSF license). These basically allow you to do whatever you want with the code: ignore it, include it in your own open source project, include it in your proprietary product, sell it, whatever. python itself is released under a BSD compatible license, in the sense that, quoting from the PSF license page:

    There is no GPL-like "copyleft" restriction. Distributing
    binary-only versions of Python, modified or not, is allowed. There
    is no requirement to release any of your source code. You can also
    write extension modules for Python and provide them only in binary
    form.

Famous projects released under a BSD-style license in the permissive sense of the last paragraph are the BSD operating system, python and TeX.

There are several reasons why early Matplotlib developers selected a BSD compatible license. Matplotlib is a python extension, and we choose a license that was based on the python license (BSD compatible). Also, we wanted to attract as many users and developers as possible, and many software companies will not use GPL code in software they plan to distribute, even those that are highly committed to open source development, such as [enthought](https://www.enthought.com), out of legitimate concern that use of the GPL will "infect" their code base by its viral nature. In effect, they want to retain the right to release some proprietary code. Companies and institutions who use Matplotlib often make significant contributions, because they have the resources to get a job done, even a boring one. Two of the Matplotlib backends (FLTK and WX) were contributed by private companies. The final reason behind the licensing choice is compatibility with the other python extensions for scientific computing: ipython, numpy, scipy, the enthought tool suite and python itself are all distributed under BSD compatible licenses.

# Community management guide

These guidelines are applicable when **acting as a representative** of Matplotlib, for example at sprints or when giving official talks or tutorials, and in any community venue managed by Matplotlib.

Our approach to community engagement is foremost guided by our \[mission-statement\](\#mission-statement):

  - We demonstrate that we care about visualization as a practice
  - We deepen our practice and the community’s capacity to support users, facilitate exploration, produce high quality visualizations, and be understandable and extensible
  - We showcase advanced use of the library without adding maintenance burden to the documentation and recognize contributions that happen outside of the github workflow.
  - We use communications platforms to maintain relationships with contributors who may no longer be active on GitHub, build relationships with potential contributors, and connect with other projects and communities who use Matplotlib.
  - In prioritizing understandability and extensibility, we recognize that people using Matplotlib, in whatever capacity, are part of our community. Doing so empowers our community members to build community with each other, for example by creating educational resources, building third party tools, and building informal mentoring networks.

## Official communication channels

The Scientific Python community uses various communications platforms to stay updated on new features and projects, to contribute by telling us what is on their mind and suggest issues and bugs, and to showcase their use cases and the tools they have built.

The following venues are managed by Matplotlib maintainers and contributors:

  - library and docs: <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib>
  - forum: <https://discourse.matplotlib.org/>
  - chat: <https://matrix.to/#/#matplotlib:matrix.org>
  - blog: <https://blog.scientific-python.org/>

  - Public chat room: <https://matrix.to/#/#matplotlib_community:gitter.im>

### Maintenance

If you are interested in moderating the chat or forum or accessing the social media accounts:

  - Matplotlib maintainers should reach out to the [community-manager](https://matplotlib.org/governance/people.html#deputy-project-leads).
  - Everyone else should send an email to <matplotlib-social-admin@numfocus.org>:
      - Introduce yourself - github handle and participation in the community.
      - Describe the reason for wanting to moderate or contribute to social.

## Content guidelines

Communication on official channels, such as the Matplotlib homepage or on Matplotlib social accounts, should conform to the following standards. If you are unsure if content that you would like to post or share meets these guidelines, ask on the \[social-media-coordination\](\#social-media-coordination) channels before posting.

### General guidelines

  - Focus on Matplotlib, 3rd party packages, and visualizations made with Matplotlib.
  - These are also acceptable topics:
      - Visualization best practices and libraries.
      - Projects and initiatives by NumFOCUS and Scientific Python.
      - How to contribute to open source projects.
      - Projects, such as scientific papers, that use Matplotlib.
  - No gratuitous disparaging of other visualization libraries and tools, but criticism is acceptable so long as it serves a constructive purpose.
  - Follow communication best practices:
      - Do not share non-expert visualizations when it could cause harm:
          - e.g. <https://twitter.com/matplotlib/status/1244178154618605568>
      - Clearly state when the visualization data/conclusions cannot be verified.
      - Do not rely on machine translations for sensitive visualization.
  - Verify sourcing of content (especially on instagram & blog):
      - Instagram/blog: ensure mpl has right to repost/share content
      - Make sure content is clearly cited:
          - e.g. a tutorial reworking an example must credit the original example
  - Limited self/corporate promotion is acceptable.
      - Should be no more than about a quarter of the content.

### Visual media guidelines

Visual media, such as images and videos, must not violate the \[code of conduct \<code\_of\_conduct\>\](\#code-of-conduct-\<code\_of\_conduct\>), nor any platform's rules. Specifically:

  - Visual media must conform to the guidelines of all sites it may be posted on:
      - <https://help.twitter.com/en/rules-and-policies/twitter-rules>
      - <https://help.instagram.com/477434105621119>
  - Emphasize the visualization techniques demonstrated by the visual media.
  - Clearly state that sharing is not an endorsement of the content.
      - e.g. bitcoin related visualizations

#### Accessibility

Visual media in communications should be made as accessible as possible:

  - Add alt text to images and videos when the platform allows:
      - [alt text for data viz](https://medium.com/nightingale/writing-alt-text-for-data-visualization-2a218ef43f81)
      - [general alt text guide](https://webaim.org/techniques/alttext/)
  - Warn on bright, strobing, images & turn off autoplay if possible.
  - For images and videos made by the social media team:
      - Make graphic perceivable to people who cannot perceive color well due to color-blindness, low vision, or any other reason.
      - Do not make bright, strobing images.
      - More guidelines at <https://webaim.org/techniques/images/>.

## Social media

Matplotlib aims for a single voice across all social media platforms to build and maintain a consistent brand identity for Matplotlib as an organization. This depersonalization is the norm on social media platforms because it enables constructive and productive conversations; People generally feel more comfortable giving negative and constructive feedback to a brand than to specific contributors.

The current Matplotlib voice and persona aims to be kind, patient, supportive and educational. This is so that it can de-escalate tensions and facilitate constructive conversations; being perceived as negative or argumentative can escalate very fast into long-lasting brand damage, being perceived as personal leads to aggression and accusations faster than an impersonal account, and being perceived as friendly and approachable leads to higher engagement. Instead of speaking with a directive authority, which can be intimidating and lead to negative engagement, it speaks as a peer or educator to empower participation. The current voice encourages more input from folks we engage with, and also makes it possible for folks who are not in the core team to participate in managing the account.

While the \[brand identity \<social-media-brand\>\](\#brand-identity-\<social-media-brand\>) is casual, the showcased content is high quality, peer-led resource building. Please follow these guidelines to maintain a consistent brand identity across platforms.

### Persona

On social media, Matplotlib:

  - Acts as a sentient visualization library, so talks about itself as a we, us, our, and it. Avoids talking about itself in the 3rd person. Never uses 1st person.
  - Is very earnest, eager to please, and aims to be patient & painfully oblivious to snark and sarcasm.
  - Gets over-excited over shiny visualizations - lots of emojis and the like -and encourages folks to share their work.
  - Highlights various parts of the library, especially the more obscure bits and bobbles.
  - Acknowledges that it is a sometimes frustrating tangle of bits & bobbles that can confuse even the folks who work on it & signal boosts their confuzzlment.

### Behavior

When acting as a representative of the library, keep responses polite and assume user statements are in good faith unless they violate the \[code of conduct \<code\_of\_conduct\>\](\#code-of-conduct-\<code\_of\_conduct\>).

### Social graph

Only follow **organizations and projects**, do not follow individual accounts for any reason, even maintainers/project leads/famous Python people\!

Following these types of accounts is encouraged:

  - NumFocus and Scientific Python projects
  - 3rd party packages
  - Visualization related projects and organizations
  - Open Source community projects
  - Sponsors

### Recurring campaigns

Typically the social media accounts will promote the following:

  - Matplotlib releases:
      - Highlight new features & major deprecations
      - Link to download/install instructions
      - Ask folks to try it out.
  - [third party packages](https://matplotlib.org/mpl-third-party/)
  - NumFocus/Scientific Python/open source visualization project releases
  - GSOC/GSOD recruiting and progress

#### Retired campaigns

  - John Hunter Excellence in Plotting, submission and winners

## Changing the guidelines

As the person tasked with implementing these guidelines, the [community-manager](https://matplotlib.org/governance/people.html#deputy-project-leads) should be alerted to proposed changes. Similarly, specific platform guidelines (e.g. twitter, instagram) should be reviewed by the person responsible for that platform, when different from the community manager. If there is no consensus, decisions about guidelines revert to the community manager.

# Contributing guide

You've discovered a bug or something else you want to change in Matplotlib — excellent\!

You've worked out a way to fix it — even better\!

You want to tell us about it — best of all\!

Below, you can find a number of ways to contribute, and how to connect with the Matplotlib community.

## Ways to contribute

<div class="dropdown" open="" data-icon="person-fill">

Do I really have something to contribute to Matplotlib?

100% yes\! There are so many ways to contribute to our community. Take a look at the following sections to learn more.

There are a few typical new contributor profiles:

  - **You are a Matplotlib user, and you see a bug, a potential improvement, or something that annoys you, and you can fix it.**
    
    You can search our issue tracker for an existing issue that describes your problem or open a new issue to inform us of the problem you observed and discuss the best approach to fix it. If your contributions would not be captured on GitHub (social media, communication, educational content), you can also reach out to us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib), [Discourse](https://discourse.matplotlib.org/) or attend any of our [community meetings](https://scientific-python.org/calendars).

  - **You are not a regular Matplotlib user but a domain expert: you know about visualization, 3D plotting, design, technical writing, statistics, or some other field where Matplotlib could be improved.**
    
    Awesome -- you have a focus on a specific application and domain and can start there. In this case, maintainers can help you figure out the best implementation; open an issue or pull request with a starting point, and we'll be happy to discuss technical approaches.
    
    If you prefer, you can use the [GitHub functionality for "draft" pull requests](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request#converting-a-pull-request-to-a-draft) and request early feedback on whatever you are working on, but you should be aware that maintainers may not review your contribution unless it has the "Ready to review" state on GitHub.

  - **You are new to Matplotlib, both as a user and contributor, and want to start contributing but have yet to develop a particular interest.**
    
    Having some previous experience or relationship with the library can be very helpful when making open-source contributions. It helps you understand why things are the way they are and how they *should* be. Having first-hand experience and context is valuable both for what you can bring to the conversation (and given the breadth of Matplotlib's usage, there is a good chance it is a unique context in any given conversation) and make it easier to understand where other people are coming from.
    
    Understanding the entire codebase is a long-term project, and nobody expects you to do this right away. If you are determined to get started with Matplotlib and want to learn, going through the basic functionality, choosing something to focus on (3d, testing, documentation, animations, etc.) and gaining context on this area by reading the issues and pull requests touching these subjects is a reasonable approach.

</div>

### Code

You want to implement a feature or fix a bug or help with maintenance - much appreciated\! Our library source code is found in:

  - Python library code: `lib/`
  - C-extension code: `src/`
  - Tests: `lib/matplotlib/tests/`

Because many people use and work on Matplotlib, we have guidelines for keeping our code consistent and mitigating the impact of changes.

  - \[coding\_guidelines\](\#coding\_guidelines)
  - \[api\_changes\](\#api\_changes)
  - \[pr-guidelines\](\#pr-guidelines)

Code is contributed through pull requests, so we recommend that you start at \[how-to-pull-request\](\#how-to-pull-request) If you get stuck, please reach out on the \[contributor\_incubator\](\#contributor\_incubator)

### Documentation

You, as an end-user of Matplotlib can make a valuable contribution because you can more clearly see the potential for improvement than a core developer. For example, you can:

  - Fix a typo
  - Clarify a docstring
  - Write or update an \[example plot \<gallery\>\](\#example-plot-\<gallery\>)
  - Write or update a comprehensive \[tutorial \<tutorials\>\](\#tutorial-\<tutorials\>)

Our code is documented inline in the source code files in `matplotlib/lib`. Our website structure mirrors our folder structure, meaning that a narrative document's URL roughly corresponds to its location in our folder structure:

<div class="grid">

Other documentation is generated from the following external sources:

  - matplotlib.org homepage: <https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-brochure-site>
  - cheat sheets: <https://github.com/matplotlib/cheatsheets>
  - third party packages: <https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-third-party>

Instructions and guidelines for contributing documentation are found in:

  - \[document\](document.md)
  - \[style\_guide\](style\_guide.md)
  - \[tag\_guidelines\](tag\_guidelines.md)

Documentation is contributed through pull requests, so we recommend that you start at \[how-to-pull-request\](\#how-to-pull-request). If that feels intimidating, we encourage you to [open an issue](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/new?assignees=&labels=Documentation&projects=&template=documentation.yml&title=%5BDoc%5D%3A+) describing what improvements you would make. If you get stuck, please reach out on the \[contributor\_incubator\](\#contributor\_incubator)

### Triage

We appreciate your help keeping the [issue tracker](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) organized because it is our centralized location for feature requests, bug reports, tracking major projects, and discussing priorities. Some examples of what we mean by triage are:

  - labeling issues and pull requests
  - verifying bug reports
  - debugging and resolving issues
  - linking to related issues, discussion, and external work

Our triage process is discussed in detail in \[bug\_triaging\](\#bug\_triaging).

If you have any questions about the process, please reach out on the \[contributor\_incubator\](\#contributor\_incubator)

### Community

Matplotlib's community is built by its members, if you would like to help out see our \[communications-guidelines\](\#communications-guidelines).

It helps us if you spread the word: reference the project from your blog and articles or link to it from your website\!

If Matplotlib contributes to a project that leads to a scientific publication, please cite us following the \[/project/citing\](/project/citing.md) guidelines.

If you have developed an extension to Matplotlib, please consider adding it to our [third party package](https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-third-party) list.

## New contributors

There is no pre-defined pathway for new contributors - we recommend looking at existing issue and pull request discussions, and following the conversations during pull request reviews to get context. Or you can deep-dive into a subset of the code-base to understand what is going on.

### New contributors meeting

Once a month, we host a meeting to discuss topics that interest new contributors. Anyone can attend, present, or sit in and listen to the call. Among our attendees are fellow new contributors, as well as maintainers, and veteran contributors, who are keen to support onboarding of new folks and share their experience. You can find our community calendar link at the [Scientific Python website](https://scientific-python.org/calendars/), and you can browse previous meeting notes on [GitHub](https://github.com/matplotlib/ProjectManagement/tree/master/new_contributor_meeting). We recommend joining the meeting to clarify any doubts, or lingering questions you might have, and to get to know a few of the people behind the GitHub handles 😉. You can reach out to us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib) for any clarifications or suggestions. We ❤ feedback\!

### Contributor incubator

The incubator is our non-public communication channel for new contributors. It is a private [gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib) (chat) room moderated by core Matplotlib developers where you can get guidance and support for your first few PRs. It's a place where you can ask questions about anything: how to use git, GitHub, how our PR review process works, technical questions about the code, what makes for good documentation or a blog post, how to get involved in community work, or get a "pre-review" on your PR.

To join, please go to our public [community](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/community) channel, and ask to be added to `#incubator`. One of our core developers will see your message and will add you.

### Good first issues

While any contributions are welcome, we have marked some issues as particularly suited for new contributors by the label [good first issue](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels/good%20first%20issue). These are well documented issues, that do not require a deep understanding of the internals of Matplotlib. The issues may additionally be tagged with a difficulty. `Difficulty: Easy` is suited for people with little Python experience. `Difficulty: Medium` and `Difficulty: Hard` require more programming experience. This could be for a variety of reasons, among them, though not necessarily all at the same time:

  - The issue is in areas of the code base which have more interdependencies, or legacy code.
  - It has less clearly defined tasks, which require some independent exploration, making suggestions, or follow-up discussions to clarify a good path to resolve the issue.
  - It involves Python features such as decorators and context managers, which have subtleties due to our implementation decisions.

### First contributions

If this is your first open source contribution, or your first time contributing to Matplotlib, and you need help or guidance finding a good first issue, look no further. This section will guide you through each step:

1.  Navigate to the [issues page](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/).
2.  Filter labels with ["Difficulty: Easy"](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels/Difficulty%3A%20Easy) & ["Good first Issue"](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels/good%20first%20issue) (optional).
3.  Click on an issue you would like to work on, and check to see if the issue has a pull request opened to resolve it.
      - A good way to judge if you chose a suitable issue is by asking yourself, "Can I independently submit a PR in 1-2 weeks?"
4.  Check existing pull requests (e.g., `28476`) and filter by the issue number to make sure the issue is not in progress:
      - If the issue has a pull request (is in progress), tag the user working on the issue, and ask to collaborate (optional).
      - If a pull request does not exist, create a [draft pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) and follow the [pull request guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/pr_guide.html).
5.  Please familiarize yourself with the pull request template (see below), and ensure you understand/are able to complete the template when you open your pull request. Additional information can be found in the [pull request guidelines](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/devel/pr_guide.html).

<div class="dropdown" open="">

[Pull request template](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md)

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="markdown">

../../.github/PULL\_REQUEST\_TEMPLATE.md

</div>

</div>

## Get connected

When in doubt, we recommend going together\! Get connected with our community of active contributors, many of whom felt just like you when they started out and are happy to welcome you and support you as you get to know how we work, and where things are. You can reach out on any of our \[communication-channels\](\#communication-channels). For development questions we recommend reaching out on our development [gitter](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib) chat room and for community questions reach out at [community](https://gitter.im/matplotlib/community).

## Choose an issue

In general, the Matplotlib project does not assign issues. Issues are "assigned" or "claimed" by opening a PR; there is no other assignment mechanism. If you have opened such a PR, please comment on the issue thread to avoid duplication of work. Please check if there is an existing PR for the issue you are addressing. If there is, try to work with the author by submitting reviews of their code or commenting on the PR rather than opening a new PR; duplicate PRs are subject to being closed. However, if the existing PR is an outline, unlikely to work, or stalled, and the original author is unresponsive, feel free to open a new PR referencing the old one.

## Start a pull request

The preferred way to contribute to Matplotlib is to fork the [main repository](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/) on GitHub, then submit a "pull request" (PR). To work on a a pull request:

1.  **First** set up a development environment, either by cloning a copy of the Matplotlib repository to your own computer or by using Github codespaces, by following the instructions in \[installing\_for\_devs\](\#installing\_for\_devs)
2.  **Then** start a pull request by following the guidance in \[development workflow \<development-workflow\>\](\#development-workflow-\<development-workflow\>)
3.  **After starting** check that your contribution meets the \[pull request guidelines \<pr-author-guidelines\>\](\#pull-request-guidelines-\<pr-author-guidelines\>) and \[update the pull request \<update-pull-request\>\](\#update-the-pull-request-\<update-pull-request\>) as needed.
4.  **Finally** follow up with maintainers on the PR if waiting more than a few days for feedback.

If you have questions of any sort, reach out on the \[contributor\_incubator\](\#contributor\_incubator) and join the \[new\_contributors\_meeting\](\#new\_contributors\_meeting).

# Setting up Matplotlib for development

To set up Matplotlib for development follow these steps:

<div class="contents" data-local="">

</div>

## Fork the Matplotlib repository

Matplotlib is hosted at <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git>. If you plan on solving issues or submitting pull requests to the main Matplotlib repository, you should first fork this repository by *clicking* the `repo-forked` **Fork** button near the top of the [project repository](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib) page.

This creates a copy of the code under your account on the GitHub server. See [the GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) for more details.

## Retrieve the latest version of the code

Now that your fork of the repository lives under your GitHub username, you can retrieve the most recent version of the source code with one of the following commands (replace `<your-username>` with your GitHub username):

<div class="tab-set">

<div class="tab-item">

https

  - \`\`\`bash  
    git clone <https://github.com/>\<your-username\>/matplotlib.git

</div>

<div class="tab-item">

ssh

``` bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/matplotlib.git
```

This requires you to setup an [SSH key]() in advance, but saves you from typing your password at every connection.

</div>

</div>

This will place the sources in a directory `matplotlib` below your `` ` current working directory and set the remote name ``origin`to point to your fork. Change into this directory before continuing::      cd matplotlib  Now set the remote name`upstream`to point to the Matplotlib main repository:  .. tab-set::     .. tab-item:: https`\`bash git remote add upstream <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.git>

> 
> 
> <div class="tab-item">
> 
> ssh
> 
> ``` bash
> git remote add upstream git@github.com:matplotlib/matplotlib.git
> ```
> 
> </div>

You can now use `upstream` to retrieve the most current snapshot of the source `` ` code, as described in [development-workflow](#development-workflow).  .. dropdown:: Additional ``git`and`GitHub`resources    :color: info    :open:     For more information on`git`and`GitHub``, see:     * `Git documentation <https://git-scm.com/doc>`_    * `GitHub-Contributing to a Project      <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/GitHub-Contributing-to-a-Project>`_    * `GitHub Skills <https://skills.github.com/>`_    * [using-git](#using-git)    * [git-resources](#git-resources)    * `Installing git <https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git>`_    * `Managing remote repositories      <https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/getting-started-with-git/managing-remote-repositories>`_    * https://tacaswell.github.io/think-like-git.html    * https://tom.preston-werner.com/2009/05/19/the-git-parable.html  .. _dev-environment:  Create a dedicated environment ============================== You should set up a dedicated environment to decouple your Matplotlib development from other Python and Matplotlib installations on your system.  We recommend using one of the following options for a dedicated development environment because these options are configured to install the Python dependencies as part of their setup.     .. tab-set::     .. tab-item:: venv environment        Create a new `venv`_ environment with ::          python -m venv <file folder location>        and activate it with one of the following ::          source <file folder location>/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS         <file folder location>\Scripts\activate.bat  # Windows cmd.exe         <file folder location>\Scripts\Activate.ps1  # Windows PowerShell        On some systems, you may need to type``python3`instead of`python``.       For a discussion of the technical reasons, see `PEP-394 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0394>`_.        Install the Python dependencies with ::          pip install -r requirements/dev/dev-requirements.txt        Remember to activate the environment whenever you start working on Matplotlib!     .. tab-item:: conda environment        Create a new `conda`_ environment and install the Python dependencies with ::          conda env create -f environment.yml        You can use``mamba`instead of`conda`` in the above command if       you have `mamba`_ installed.        .. _mamba: https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/        Activate the environment using ::          conda activate mpl-dev        Remember to activate the environment whenever you start working on Matplotlib!     .. tab-item:: :octicon:`codespaces` GitHub Codespaces        `GitHub Codespaces <https://docs.github.com/codespaces>`_ is a cloud-based       in-browser development environment that comes with the appropriate setup to       contribute to Matplotlib.        #. Open codespaces on your fork by clicking on the green :octicon:`code` ``Code`button on the GitHub web interface and selecting the`Codespaces`tab.        #. Next, click on "Open codespaces on <your branch name>". You will be          able to change branches later, so you can select the default`main`branch.        #. After the codespace is created, you will be taken to a new browser          tab where you can use the terminal to activate a pre-defined conda          environment called`mpl-dev``::           conda activate mpl-dev        Remember to activate the *mpl-dev* environment whenever you start working on       Matplotlib.        If you need to open a GUI window with Matplotlib output on Codespaces, our       configuration includes a `light-weight Fluxbox-based desktop       <https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite>`_.       You can use it by connecting to this desktop via your web browser. To do this:        #. Press``F1`or`Ctrl/Cmd+Shift+P`and select`Ports: Focus on Ports View`in the VSCode session to bring it into          focus. Open the ports view in your tool, select the`noVNC`port, and          click the Globe icon.       #. In the browser that appears, click the Connect button and enter the desktop          password (`vscode``by default).        Check the `GitHub instructions       <https://github.com/devcontainers/features/tree/main/src/desktop-lite#connecting-to-the-desktop>`_       for more details on connecting to the desktop.        If you also built the documentation pages, you can view them using Codespaces.       Use the "Extensions" icon in the activity bar to install the "Live Server"       extension. Locate the``doc/build/html``folder in the Explorer, right click       the file you want to open and select "Open with Live Server."   Install external dependencies =============================  Python dependencies were installed as part of [setting up the environment <dev-environment>](#setting-up-the-environment-<dev-environment>). Additionally, the following non-Python dependencies must also be installed locally:  .. rst-class:: checklist  * [c++ compiler<compile-dependencies>](#c++-compiler<compile-dependencies>) * [documentation build dependencies <doc-dependencies-external>](#documentation-build-dependencies-<doc-dependencies-external>)   For a full list of dependencies, see [dependencies](#dependencies). External dependencies do not need to be installed when working in codespaces.  .. _development-install:  Install Matplotlib in editable mode ===================================  Install Matplotlib in editable mode from the :file:`matplotlib` directory using the command ::      python -m pip install --verbose --no-build-isolation --editable ".[dev]"  The 'editable/develop mode' builds everything and places links in your Python environment so that Python will be able to import Matplotlib from your development source directory. This allows you to import your modified version of Matplotlib without having to re-install after changing a``.py``or compiled extension file.  When working on a branch that does not have Meson enabled, meaning it does not have :ghpull:`26621` in its history (log), you will have to reinstall from source each time you change any compiled extension code.  If the installation is not working, please consult the [troubleshooting guide <troubleshooting-faq>](#troubleshooting-guide-<troubleshooting-faq>). If the guide does not offer a solution, please reach out via `chat <https://gitter.im/matplotlib/matplotlib>`_ or [open an issue <submitting-a-bug-report>](#open-an-issue-<submitting-a-bug-report>).   Build options ------------- If you are working heavily with files that need to be compiled, you may want to inspect the compilation log. This can be enabled by setting the environment variable :envvar:`MESONPY_EDITABLE_VERBOSE` or by setting the``editable-verbose`config during installation ::     python -m pip install --no-build-isolation --config-settings=editable-verbose=true --editable .  For more information on installation and other configuration options, see the Meson Python :external+meson-python[editable installs guide <how-to-guides-editable-installs>](#editable-installs-guide-<how-to-guides-editable-installs>).  For a list of the other environment variables you can set before install, see [environment-variables](#environment-variables).   Verify the Installation =======================  Run the following command to make sure you have correctly installed Matplotlib in editable mode. The command should be run when the virtual environment is activated::      python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__file__)"  This command should return :`\<matplotlib\_local\_repo\>libmatplotlib\_\_init\_\_.py``We encourage you to run tests and build docs to verify that the code installed correctly and that the docs build cleanly, so that when you make code or document related changes you are aware of the existing issues beforehand.  * Run test cases to verify installation [testing](#testing) * Verify documentation build [documenting-matplotlib](#documenting-matplotlib)  .. _pre-commit-hooks:  Install pre-commit hooks ======================== `pre-commit <https://pre-commit.com/>`_ hooks save time in the review process by identifying issues with the code before a pull request is formally opened. Most hooks can also aide in fixing the errors, and the checks should have corresponding [development workflow <development-workflow>](#development-workflow-<development-workflow>) and [pull request <pr-guidelines>](#pull-request-<pr-guidelines>) guidelines. Hooks are configured in `.pre-commit-config.yaml <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml?>`_ and include checks for spelling and formatting, flake 8 conformity, accidentally committed files, import order, and incorrect branching.  Install pre-commit hooks ::      python -m pip install pre-commit     pre-commit install  Hooks are run automatically after the``git commit`stage of the [editing workflow<edit-flow>](#editing-workflow<edit-flow>). When a hook has found and fixed an error in a file, that file must be *staged and committed* again.  Hooks can also be run manually. All the hooks can be run, in order as listed in`.pre-commit-config.yaml`, against the full codebase with ::      pre-commit run --all-files  To run a particular hook manually, run`pre-commit run`with the hook id ::      pre-commit run <hook id> --all-files   Please note that the`mypy`pre-commit hook cannot check the [type-hints](#type-hints) for new functions; instead the stubs for new functions are checked using the`stubtest`[CI check <automated-tests>](#ci-check-<automated-tests>) and can be checked locally using`tox -e stubtest\`\`.

# Development workflow

## Workflow summary

To keep your work well organized, with readable history, and in turn make it easier for project maintainers (that might be you) to see what you've done, and why you did it, we recommend the following:

  - Don't make changes in your local `main` branch\!
  - Before starting a new set of changes, fetch all changes from `upstream/main`, and start a new *feature branch* from that.
  - Make a new branch for each feature or bug fix — "one task, one branch".
  - Name your branch for the purpose of the changes - e.g. `bugfix-for-issue-14` or `refactor-database-code`.
  - If you get stuck, reach out on Gitter or [discourse](https://discourse.matplotlib.org).
  - When you're ready or need feedback on your code, open a pull request so that the Matplotlib developers can give feedback and eventually include your suggested code into the `main` branch.

### Overview

After \[setting up a development environment \<installing\_for\_devs\>\](\#setting-up-a-development-environment-\<installing\_for\_devs\>), the typical workflow is:

1.  Fetch all changes from `upstream/main`:
    
    ``` bash
    git fetch upstream/main
    ```

2.  Start a new *feature branch* from `upstream/main`:
    
    ``` bash
    git checkout -b my-feature upstream/main
    ```

3.  When you're done editing, e.g., `lib/matplotlib/collections.py`, record your changes in Git:
    
    ``` bash
    git add lib/matplotlib/collections.py
    git commit -m 'a commit message'
    ```

4.  Push the changes to your GitHub fork:
    
    ``` bash
    git push -u origin my-feature
    ```

## Update the `main` branch

First make sure you have followed \[installing\_for\_devs\](\#installing\_for\_devs).

From time to time you should fetch the upstream changes from GitHub:

``` bash
git fetch upstream
```

This will pull down any commits you don't have, and set the remote branches to point to the right commit.

## Make a new feature branch

When you are ready to make some changes to the code, you should start a new branch. Branches that are for a collection of related edits are often called 'feature branches'. Making a new branch for each set of related changes will make it easier for someone reviewing your branch to see what you are doing.

Choose an informative name for the branch to remind yourself and the rest of us what the changes in the branch are for. For example `add-ability-to-fly`, or `bugfix-for-issue-42`.

The process for creating a new feature branch is:

``` bash
# Update the main branch
git fetch upstream
# Make new feature branch starting at current main
git branch my-new-feature upstream/main
git checkout my-new-feature
```

If you started making changes on your local `main` branch, you can convert the branch to a feature branch by renaming it:

``` bash
git branch -m <newname>
```

Generally, you will want to keep your feature branches on your public GitHub fork of Matplotlib. To do this, you `git push` this new branch up to your GitHub repo. Generally, if you followed the instructions in these pages, and by default, git will have a link to your fork of the GitHub repo, called `origin`. You push up to your own fork with:

``` bash
git push origin my-new-feature
```

## The editing workflow

1.  Make some changes
2.  Save the changes
3.  See which files have changed with `git status`. You'll see a listing like this one:
      - \`\`\`none  
        \# On branch ny-new-feature \# Changed but not updated: \# (use "git add \<file\>..." to update what will be committed) \# (use "git checkout -- \<file\>..." to discard changes in working directory) \# \# modified: README \# \# Untracked files: \# (use "git add \<file\>..." to include in what will be committed) \# \# INSTALL no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

\#. Check what the actual changes are with `git diff`. `` ` #. Add any new files to version control ``git add new\_file\_name`. #. To commit **all** modified files into the local copy of your repo, type:`\`bash git commit -am 'A commit message'

Note the `-am` options to `commit`. The `m` flag signals that you are going to type a message on the command line. The `a` flag stages every file that has been modified, except files listed in `.gitignore`. For more information, see [why the -a flag?](http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/01/18/the-staging-area.html) and the [git commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit) manual page. `` ` #. To push the changes up to your forked repo on GitHub, do a ``git push``.     Open a pull request ===================  When you are ready to ask for someone to review your code and consider a merge, `submit your Pull Request (PR) <https://docs.github.com/pull-requests>`_.  Go to the web page of *your fork* of the Matplotlib repo, and click``Compare & pull request`to send your changes to the maintainers for review. The base repository is`matplotlib/matplotlib`and the base branch is generally`main``.  Enter a title for the set of changes with some explanation of what you've done. Mention anything you'd like particular attention for - such as a complicated change or some code you are not happy with.  If you don't think your request is ready to be merged, just say so in your pull request message and use the "Draft PR" feature of GitHub. This is a good way of getting some preliminary code review.  For more guidance on the mechanics of making a pull request, see GitHub's `pull request tutorial <https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork>`_.  .. _update-pull-request:  Update a pull request =====================  When updating your pull request after making revisions, instead of adding new commits, please consider amending your initial commit(s) to keep the commit history clean.  You can achieve this by using``\`bash git commit -a --amend --no-edit git push \[your-remote-repo\] \[your-branch\] --force-with-lease

<div class="tip">

<div class="title">

Tip

</div>

Instead of typing your branch name every time, you only need to type the following once to link the remote branch to the local branch:

git push --set-upstream origin my-new-feature

From now on git will know that `my-new-feature` is related to the `my-new-feature` branch in the GitHub repo. After this, you will be able to push your changes with:

git push

</div>

Manage commit history `` ` =====================  Explore your repository -----------------------  To see a graphical representation of the repository branches and commits::     gitk --all  To see a linear list of commits for this branch::     git log   .. _recovering-from-mess-up:  Recover from mistakes ---------------------  Sometimes, you mess up merges or rebases. Luckily, in git it is relatively straightforward to recover from such mistakes.  If you mess up during a rebase::     git rebase --abort  If you notice you messed up after the rebase::     # reset branch back to the saved point    git reset --hard tmp  If you forgot to make a backup branch::     # look at the reflog of the branch    git reflog show cool-feature     8630830 cool-feature@{0}: commit: BUG: io: close file handles immediately    278dd2a cool-feature@{1}: rebase finished: refs/heads/my-feature-branch onto 11ee694744f2552d    26aa21a cool-feature@{2}: commit: BUG: lib: make seek_gzip_factory not leak gzip obj    ...     # reset the branch to where it was before the botched rebase    git reset --hard cool-feature@{2}  .. _rewriting-commit-history:  Rewrite commit history ----------------------  > **Note** >     Do this only for your own feature branches.  Is there an embarrassing typo in a commit you made? Or perhaps you made several false starts you don't want posterity to see.  This can be done via *interactive rebasing*.  Suppose that the commit history looks like this::      git log --oneline     eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs     a815645 Modify it so that it works     2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable     13d7934 First implementation     6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant     29001ed Add pre-nep for a copule of structured_array_extensions.     ...  and ``6ad92e5`is the last commit in the`cool-feature`branch. Suppose we want to make the following changes:  * Rewrite the commit message for`13d7934`to something more sensible. * Combine the commits`2dec1ac`,`a815645`,`eadc391`into a single one.  We do as follows::      # make a backup of the current state     git branch tmp HEAD     # interactive rebase     git rebase -i 6ad92e5  This will open an editor with the following text in it::      pick 13d7934 First implementation     pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable     pick a815645 Modify it so that it works     pick eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs      # Rebase 6ad92e5..eadc391 onto 6ad92e5     #     # Commands:     #  p, pick = use commit     #  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message     #  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending     #  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit     #  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message     #     # If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.     # However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.     #  To achieve what we want, we will make the following changes to it::      r 13d7934 First implementation     pick 2dec1ac Fix a few bugs + disable     f a815645 Modify it so that it works     f eadc391 Fix some remaining bugs  This means that (i) we want to edit the commit message for`13d7934`, and (ii) collapse the last three commits into one. Now we save and quit the editor.  Git will then immediately bring up an editor for editing the commit message. After revising it, we get the output::      [detached HEAD 721fc64] FOO: First implementation      2 files changed, 199 insertions(+), 66 deletions(-)     [detached HEAD 0f22701] Fix a few bugs + disable      1 files changed, 79 insertions(+), 61 deletions(-)     Successfully rebased and updated refs/heads/my-feature-branch.  and now, the history looks like this::       0f22701 Fix a few bugs + disable      721fc64 ENH: Sophisticated feature      6ad92e5 * masked is now an instance of a new object, MaskedConstant  If it went wrong, recovery is again possible as explained [above <recovering-from-mess-up>](#above <recovering-from-mess-up>).  If you have not yet pushed this branch to github, you can carry on as normal, however if you *have* already pushed this commit see [force-push](#force-push) for how to replace your already published commits with the new ones.   .. _rebase-on-main:  Rebase onto`upstream/main`-----------------------------  Let's say you thought of some work you'd like to do. You [update-mirror-main](#update-mirror-main) and [make-feature-branch](#make-feature-branch) called`cool-feature`. At this stage,`main`is at some commit, let's call it E. Now you make some new commits on your`cool-feature`branch, let's call them A, B, C. Maybe your changes take a while, or you come back to them after a while. In the meantime,`main`has progressed from commit E to commit (say) G:`\`none A---B---C cool-feature / D---E---F---G main

At this stage you consider merging `main` into your feature branch, and you `` ` remember that this page sternly advises you not to do that, because the history will get messy. Most of the time, you can just ask for a review without worrying about whether ``main`has got a little ahead; however sometimes, the changes in`main`might affect your changes, and you need to harmonize them.  In this situation you may prefer to do a rebase.`rebase`takes your changes (A, B, C) and replays them as if they had been made to the current state of`main`.  In other words, in this case, it takes the changes represented by A, B, C and replays them on top of G. After the rebase, your history will look like this:`\`none A'--B'--C' cool-feature / D---E---F---G main

See [rebase without tears](https://matthew-brett.github.io/pydagogue/rebase_without_tears.html) for more detail.

To do a rebase on `upstream/main`:

``` bash
# Fetch changes from upstream/main
git fetch upstream
# go to the feature branch
git checkout cool-feature
# make a backup in case you mess up
git branch tmp cool-feature
# rebase cool-feature onto main
git rebase --onto upstream/main upstream/main cool-feature
```

In this situation, where you are already on branch `cool-feature`, the last `` ` command can be written more succinctly as::      git rebase upstream/main  When all looks good, you can delete your backup branch::     git branch -D tmp  If it doesn't look good you may need to have a look at [recovering-from-mess-up](#recovering-from-mess-up).  If you have made changes to files that have also changed in ``main``, this may generate merge conflicts that you need to resolve - see the `git rebase`_ man page for some instructions at the end of the "Description" section. There is some related help on merging in the git user manual - see `resolving a merge`_.      If you have not yet pushed this branch to github, you can carry on as normal, however if you *have* already pushed this commit see [force-push](#force-push) for how to replace your already published commits with the new ones.   .. _force-push:   Push with force ---------------   If you have in some way re-written already pushed history (e.g. via [rewriting-commit-history](#rewriting-commit-history) or [rebase-on-main](#rebase-on-main)) leaving you with a git history that looks something like``\`none A'--E cool-feature / D---A---B---C origin/cool-feature

where you have pushed the commits `A,B,C` to your fork on GitHub (under the `` ` remote name *origin*) but now have the commits ``A'`and`E`on your local branch *cool-feature*.  If you try to push the new commits to GitHub, it will fail and show an error that looks like ::     $ git push    Pushing to github.com:origin/matplotlib.git    To github.com:origin/matplotlib.git     ! [rejected]              cool_feature -> cool_feature (non-fast-forward)    error: failed to push some refs to 'github.com:origin/matplotlib.git'    hint: Updates were rejected because the tip of your current branch is behind    hint: its remote counterpart. Integrate the remote changes (e.g.    hint: 'git pull ...') before pushing again.    hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.  If this push had succeeded, the commits`A`,`B`, and`C`would no longer be referenced by any branch and they would be discarded:`\`none D---A'---E cool-feature, origin/cool-feature

By default `git push` helpfully tries to protect you from accidentally `` ` discarding commits by rejecting the push to the remote.  When this happens, GitHub also adds the helpful suggestion to pull the remote changes and then try pushing again.  In some cases, such as if you and a colleague are both committing and pushing to the same branch, this is a correct course of action.  However, in the case of having intentionally re-written history, we *want* to discard the commits on the remote and replace them with the new-and-improved versions from our local branch.  In this case, what we want to do is ::    $ git push --force-with-lease  which tells git you are aware of the risks and want to do the push anyway.  We recommend using ``--force-with-lease`over the`--force`flag.  The`--force`will do the push no matter what, whereas`--force-with-lease`will only do the push if the remote branch is where the local`git`client thought it was.  Be judicious with force-pushing.  It is effectively re-writing published history, and if anyone has fetched the old commits, it will have a different view of history which can cause confusion.  .. _automated-tests:  Automated tests ===============  Whenever a pull request is created or updated, various automated test tools will run on all supported platforms and versions of Python.  * tox_ is not used in the automated testing.

# Write documentation

## Getting started

### General file structure

All documentation is built from the `doc/`. The `doc/` directory contains configuration files for Sphinx and reStructuredText ([ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html); `.rst`) files that are rendered to documentation pages.

Documentation is created in three ways. First, API documentation (`doc/api`) is created by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) from the docstrings of the classes in the Matplotlib library. Except for `doc/api/api_changes/`, `.rst` files in `doc/api` are created when the documentation is built. See \[writing-docstrings\](\#writing-docstrings) below.

Second, our example pages, tutorials, and some of the narrative documentation are created by [Sphinx Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Sphinx Gallery converts example Python files to `*.rst` files with the result of Matplotlib plot calls as embedded images. See \[writing-examples-and-tutorials\](\#writing-examples-and-tutorials) below.

Third, Matplotlib has narrative docs written in [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) in subdirectories of `doc/users/`. If you would like to add new documentation that is suited to an `.rst` file rather than a gallery or tutorial example, choose an appropriate subdirectory to put it in, and add the file to the table of contents of `index.rst` of the subdirectory. See \[writing-rest-pages\](\#writing-rest-pages) below.

\> **Note** \> Don't directly edit the `.rst` files in `doc/plot_types`, `doc/gallery`, `doc/tutorials`, and `doc/api` (excepting `doc/api/api_changes/`). [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) regenerates files in these directories when building documentation.

### Set up the build

The documentation for Matplotlib is generated from reStructuredText ([ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html)) using the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation generation tool.

To build the documentation you will need to \[set up Matplotlib for development \<installing\_for\_devs\>\](\#set-up-matplotlib-for-development-\<installing\_for\_devs\>). Note in particular the \[additional dependencies \<doc-dependencies\>\](\#additional-dependencies-\<doc-dependencies\>) required to build the documentation.

### Build the docs

The documentation sources are found in the `doc/` directory. The configuration file for Sphinx is `doc/conf.py`. It controls which directories Sphinx parses, how the docs are built, and how the extensions are used. To build the documentation in html format, cd into `doc/` and run:

`` `sh    make html  > **Note** >     Since the documentation is very large, the first build may take 10-20 minutes,    depending on your machine.  Subsequent builds will be faster.  Other useful invocations include  .. code-block:: sh     # Build the html documentation, but skip generation of the gallery images to    # save time.    make html-noplot     # Build the html documentation, but skip specific subdirectories.  If a gallery    # directory is skipped, the gallery images are not generated.  The first    # time this is run, it creates ``.mpl\_skip\_subdirs.yaml`which can be edited    # to add or remove subdirectories    make html-skip-subdirs     # Delete built files.  May help if you get errors about missing paths or    # broken links.    make clean     # Build pdf docs.    make latexpdf  The`SPHINXOPTS`variable is set to`-W --keep-going`by default to build`\` the complete docs but exit with exit status 1 if there are warnings. To unset it, use

`` `sh    make SPHINXOPTS= html  You can use the ``O`variable to set additional options:  *`make O=-j4 html`runs a parallel build with 4 processes.`<span class="title-ref"> \* </span><span class="title-ref">make O=-Dplot\_formats=png:100 html</span>\` saves figures in low resolution.

Multiple options can be combined, e.g. `make O='-j4 -Dplot_formats=png:100' html`.

On Windows, set the options as environment variables, e.g.:

`` `bat    set SPHINXOPTS= & set O=-j4 -Dplot_formats=png:100 & make html  Show locally built docs ``\` -----------------------

The built docs are available in the folder `build/html`. A shortcut for opening them in your default browser is:

`` `sh    make show  .. _writing-rest-pages:  Write ReST pages ``\` ================

Most documentation is either in the docstrings of individual classes and methods, in explicit `.rst` files, or in examples and tutorials. All of these use the [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) syntax and are processed by [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org).

The [Sphinx reStructuredText Primer](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html) is a good introduction into using ReST. More complete information is available in the [reStructuredText reference documentation](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html#reference-documentation).

This section contains additional information and conventions how ReST is used in the Matplotlib documentation.

### Formatting and style conventions

It is useful to strive for consistency in the Matplotlib documentation. Here are some formatting and style conventions that are used.

#### Section formatting

Use [sentence case](https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/capitalization/sentence-case) `Upper lower` for section titles, e.g., `Possible hangups` rather than `Possible Hangups`.

We aim to follow the recommendations from the [Python documentation](https://devguide.python.org/documenting/#sections) and the [Sphinx reStructuredText documentation](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#sections) for section markup characters, i.e.:

  - `#` with overline, for parts. This is reserved for the main title in `index.rst`. All other pages should start with "chapter" or lower.
  - `*` with overline, for chapters
  - `=`, for sections
  - `-`, for subsections
  - `^`, for subsubsections
  - `"`, for paragraphs

This may not yet be applied consistently in existing docs.

#### Table formatting

Given the size of the table and length of each entry, use:

|             |                                                                                                        |                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|             | small table                                                                                            | large table                                                                                  |
| short entry | [simple or grid table](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html#tables) | [grid table](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html#grid-tables) |
| long entry  | [list table](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#list-table)                  | [csv table](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#csv-table-1)        |

For more information, see [rst tables](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#tables).

#### Function arguments

Function arguments and keywords within docstrings should be referred to using the `*emphasis*` role. This will keep Matplotlib's documentation consistent with Python's documentation:

`` `rst   Here is a description of *argument*  Do not use the ``<span class="title-ref">default role</span>``:  .. code-block:: rst     Do not describe `argument` like this.  As per the next section,    this syntax will (unsuccessfully) attempt to resolve the argument as a    link to a class or method in the library.  nor the```literal``role:  .. code-block:: rst     Do not describe`argument`like this.   .. _internal-section-refs:  Refer to other documents and sections`\` -------------------------------------

[Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) supports internal [references](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/restructuredtext/roles.html):

| Role      | Links target    | Representation in rendered HTML             |
| --------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `:doc:`\_ | document        | link to a page                              |
| `:ref:`\_ | reference label | link to an anchor associated with a heading |

Examples:

`` `rst    See the [/install/index](/install/index.md)     See the tutorial [quick_start](#quick_start)     See the example [/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot](/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.md)  will render as:    See the [/install/index](/install/index.md)    See the tutorial [quick_start](#quick_start)    See the example [/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot](/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.md)  Sections can also be given reference labels.  For instance from the ``\` \[/install/index\](/install/index.md) link:

`` `rst    .. _clean-install:     How to completely remove Matplotlib    ===================================     Occasionally, problems with Matplotlib can be solved with a clean...  and refer to it using the standard reference syntax:  .. code-block:: rst     See [clean-install](#clean-install)  will give the following link: [clean-install](#clean-install)  To maximize internal consistency in section labeling and references, ``<span class="title-ref"> use hyphen separated, descriptive labels for section references. Keep in mind that contents may be reorganized later, so avoid top level names in references like </span><span class="title-ref">user</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">devel</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">faq</span>\` unless necessary, because for example the FAQ "what is a backend?" could later become part of the users guide, so the label:

`` `rst    .. _what-is-a-backend:  is better than:  .. code-block:: rst     .. _faq-backend:  In addition, since underscores are widely used by Sphinx itself, use ``\` hyphens to separate words.

### Refer to other code

To link to other methods, classes, or modules in Matplotlib you can use back ticks, for example:

`` `rst   `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`  generates a link like this: `matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`.  *Note:* We use the sphinx setting ``default\_role = 'obj'`so that you don't`<span class="title-ref"> have to use qualifiers like </span><span class="title-ref">:class:</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">:func:</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">:meth:</span>\` and the likes.

Often, you don't want to show the full package and module name. As long as the target is unambiguous you can simply leave them out:

`` `rst   `.LineCollection`  and the link still works: `.LineCollection`. Note that you should typically include ``<span class="title-ref"> the leading dot. It tells Sphinx to look for the given name in the whole project. See also the explanation at \`Sphinx: Cross-referencing Python objects \<https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/domains/python.html\#cross-referencing-python-objects\></span>\_.

If there are multiple code elements with the same name (e.g. `plot()` is a method in multiple classes), you'll have to extend the definition:

`` `rst   `.pyplot.plot` or `.Axes.plot`  These will show up as `.pyplot.plot` or `.Axes.plot`. To still show only the ``\` last segment you can add a tilde as prefix:

`` `rst   `~.pyplot.plot` or `~.Axes.plot`  will render as `~.pyplot.plot` or `~.Axes.plot`.  Other packages can also be linked via ``<span class="title-ref"> \`intersphinx \<http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/intersphinx.html\></span>\_:

`` `rst   `numpy.mean`  will return this link: `numpy.mean`.  This works for Python, Numpy, Scipy, ``<span class="title-ref"> and Pandas (full list is in :file:\`doc/conf.py</span>). If external linking fails, you can check the full list of referenceable objects with the following commands:

    python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://docs.python.org/3/objects.inv'
    python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://numpy.org/doc/stable/objects.inv'
    python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/objects.inv'
    python -m sphinx.ext.intersphinx 'https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/objects.inv'

### Include figures and files

Image files can directly included in pages with the `image::` directive. e.g., `tutorials/intermediate/constrainedlayout_guide.py` displays a couple of static images:

    # .. image:: /_static/constrained_layout_1b.png
    #    :align: center

Files can be included verbatim. For instance the `LICENSE` file is included at \[license-agreement\](\#license-agreement) using :

    .. literalinclude:: ../../LICENSE/LICENSE

The examples directory is copied to `doc/gallery` by sphinx-gallery, so plots from the examples directory can be included using

`` `rst     .. plot:: gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.py  Note that the python script that generates the plot is referred to, rather than ``\` any plot that is created. Sphinx-gallery will provide the correct reference when the documentation is built.

### Tools for writing mathematical expressions

In most cases, you will likely want to use one of [Sphinx's builtin Math extensions](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/math.html). In rare cases we want the rendering of the mathematical text in the documentation html to exactly match with the rendering of the mathematical expression in the Matplotlib figure. In these cases, you can use the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl</span> Sphinx extension (See also the \[../users/explain/text/mathtext\](../users/explain/text/mathtext.md) tutorial.)

## Write docstrings

Most of the API documentation is written in docstrings. These are comment blocks in source code that explain how the code works.

\> **Note** \> Some parts of the documentation do not yet conform to the current documentation style. If in doubt, follow the rules given here and not what you may see in the source code. Pull requests updating docstrings to the current style are very welcome.

All new or edited docstrings should conform to the [numpydoc docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html). Much of the [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) syntax discussed above (\[writing-rest-pages\](\#writing-rest-pages)) can be used for links and references. These docstrings eventually populate the `doc/api` directory and form the reference documentation for the library.

### Example docstring

An example docstring looks like:

`` `python     def hlines(self, y, xmin, xmax, colors=None, linestyles='solid',                label='', **kwargs):         """         Plot horizontal lines at each *y* from *xmin* to *xmax*.          Parameters         ----------         y : float or array-like             y-indexes where to plot the lines.          xmin, xmax : float or array-like             Respective beginning and end of each line. If scalars are             provided, all lines will have the same length.          colors : list of colors, default: :rc:`lines.color`          linestyles : {'solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted'}, optional          label : str, default: ''          Returns         -------         `~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection`          Other Parameters         ----------------         data : indexable object, optional             DATA_PARAMETER_PLACEHOLDER         **kwargs :  `~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` properties.          See Also         --------         vlines : vertical lines         axhline : horizontal line across the Axes         """  See the `~.Axes.hlines` documentation for how this renders.  The Sphinx_ website also contains plenty of documentation_ concerning ReST ``\` markup and working with Sphinx in general.

### Formatting conventions

The basic docstring conventions are covered in the [numpydoc docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) and the [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org) documentation. Some Matplotlib-specific formatting conventions to keep in mind:

#### Quote positions

The quotes for single line docstrings are on the same line (pydocstyle D200):

    def get_linewidth(self):
        """Return the line width in points."""

The quotes for multi-line docstrings are on separate lines (pydocstyle D213):

    def set_linestyle(self, ls):
    """
    Set the linestyle of the line.
    
    [...]
    """

#### Function arguments

Function arguments and keywords within docstrings should be referred to using the `*emphasis*` role. This will keep Matplotlib's documentation consistent with Python's documentation:

`` `rst   If *linestyles* is *None*, the default is 'solid'.  Do not use the ``<span class="title-ref">default role</span>`or the``literal```role:  .. code-block:: rst    Neither `argument` nor``argument`should be used.   Quotes for strings`\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Matplotlib does not have a convention whether to use single-quotes or double-quotes. There is a mixture of both in the current code.

Use simple single or double quotes when giving string values, e.g.

`` `rst   If 'tight', try to figure out the tight bbox of the figure.    No ``'extra'`literal quotes.  The use of extra literal quotes around the text is discouraged. While they`\` slightly improve the rendered docs, they are cumbersome to type and difficult to read in plain-text docs.

#### Parameter type descriptions

The main goal for parameter type descriptions is to be readable and understandable by humans. If the possible types are too complex use a simplification for the type description and explain the type more precisely in the text.

Generally, the [numpydoc docstring guide](https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html) conventions apply. The following rules expand on them where the numpydoc conventions are not specific.

Use `float` for a type that can be any number.

Use `(float, float)` to describe a 2D position. The parentheses should be included to make the tuple-ness more obvious.

Use `array-like` for homogeneous numeric sequences, which could typically be a numpy.array. Dimensionality may be specified using `2D`, `3D`, `n-dimensional`. If you need to have variables denoting the sizes of the dimensions, use capital letters in brackets (`(M, N) array-like`). When referring to them in the text they are easier read and no special formatting is needed. Use `array` instead of `array-like` for return types if the returned object is indeed a numpy array.

`float` is the implicit default dtype for array-likes. For other dtypes use `array-like of int`.

Some possible uses:

    2D array-like
    (N,) array-like
    (M, N) array-like
    (M, N, 3) array-like
    array-like of int

Non-numeric homogeneous sequences are described as lists, e.g.:

    list of str
    list of `.Artist`

#### Reference types

Generally, the rules from [referring-to-other-code](#referring-to-other-code) apply. More specifically:

Use full references `` `~matplotlib.colors.Normalize ``<span class="title-ref"> with an abbreviation tilde in parameter types. While the full name helps the reader of plain text docstrings, the HTML does not need to show the full name as it links to it. Hence, the </span><span class="title-ref">\~</span>\`-shortening keeps it more readable.

Use abbreviated links `` `.Normalize ``\` in the text.

`` `rst    norm : `~matplotlib.colors.Normalize`, optional         A `.Normalize` instance is used to scale luminance data to 0, 1.  Default values ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

As opposed to the numpydoc guide, parameters need not be marked as *optional* if they have a simple default:

  - use `{name} : {type}, default: {val}` when possible.
  - use `{name} : {type}, optional` and describe the default in the text if it cannot be explained sufficiently in the recommended manner.

The default value should provide semantic information targeted at a human reader. In simple cases, it restates the value in the function signature. If applicable, units should be added.

`` `rst    Prefer:        interval : int, default: 1000ms    over:        interval : int, default: 1000  If *None* is only used as a sentinel value for "parameter not specified", do ``\` not document it as the default. Depending on the context, give the actual default, or mark the parameter as optional if not specifying has no particular effect.

`` `rst    Prefer:        dpi : float, default: :rc:`figure.dpi`    over:        dpi : float, default: None     Prefer:        textprops : dict, optional            Dictionary of keyword parameters to be passed to the            `~matplotlib.text.Text` instance contained inside TextArea.    over:        textprops : dict, default: None            Dictionary of keyword parameters to be passed to the            `~matplotlib.text.Text` instance contained inside TextArea. ``See also`sections`\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Sphinx automatically links code elements in the definition blocks of `See also` sections. No need to use backticks there:

    See Also
    --------
    vlines : vertical lines
    axhline : horizontal line across the Axes

#### Wrap parameter lists

Long parameter lists should be wrapped using a `\` for continuation and starting on the new line without any indent (no indent because pydoc will parse the docstring and strip the line continuation so that indent would result in a lot of whitespace within the line):

`` `python   def add_axes(self, *args, **kwargs):       """       ...        Parameters       ----------       projection : {'aitoff', 'hammer', 'lambert', 'mollweide', 'polar', \   'rectilinear'}, optional           The projection type of the axes.        ...       """  Alternatively, you can describe the valid parameter values in a dedicated ``\` section of the docstring.

#### rcParams

rcParams can be referenced with the custom `:rc:` role: `` :rc:\`foo\` `` yields `rcParams["foo"] = 'default'`, which is a link to the `matplotlibrc` file description.

### Setters and getters

Artist properties are implemented using setter and getter methods (because Matplotlib predates the Python <span class="title-ref">property</span> decorator). By convention, these setters and getters are named `set_PROPERTYNAME` and `get_PROPERTYNAME`; the list of properties thusly defined on an artist and their values can be listed by the <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.setp</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.getp</span> functions.

The Parameters block of property setter methods is parsed to document the accepted values, e.g. the docstring of <span class="title-ref">.Line2D.set\_linestyle</span> starts with

`` `python    def set_linestyle(self, ls):        """        Set the linestyle of the line.         Parameters        ----------        ls : {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}            etc.        """  which results in the following line in the output of ``plt.setp(line)`or`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">plt.setp(line, "linestyle")</span>\`:

    linestyle or ls: {'-', '--', '-.', ':', '', (offset, on-off-seq), ...}

In some rare cases (mostly, setters which accept both a single tuple and an unpacked tuple), the accepted values cannot be documented in such a fashion; in that case, they can be documented as an `.. ACCEPTS:` block, e.g. for \`.axes.Axes.set\_xlim\`:

`` `python    def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None):        """        Set the x-axis view limits.         Parameters        ----------        left : float, optional            The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the            limit unchanged.             The left and right xlims may also be passed as the tuple            (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as            the *left* keyword argument).             .. ACCEPTS: (bottom: float, top: float)         right : float, optional            etc.        """  Note that the leading ``..`makes the`.. ACCEPTS:`block a reST comment,`\` hiding it from the rendered docs.

### Keyword arguments

\> **Note** \> The information in this section is being actively discussed by the development team, so use the docstring interpolation only if necessary. This section has been left in place for now because this interpolation is part of the existing documentation.

Since Matplotlib uses a lot of pass-through `kwargs`, e.g., in every function that creates a line (<span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.plot</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.semilogx</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.semilogy</span>, etc.), it can be difficult for the new user to know which `kwargs` are supported. Matplotlib uses a docstring interpolation scheme to support documentation of every function that takes a `**kwargs`. The requirements are:

1.  single point of configuration so changes to the properties don't require multiple docstring edits.
2.  as automated as possible so that as properties change, the docs are updated automatically.

The `@_docstring.interpd` decorator implements this. Any function accepting <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> pass-through `kwargs`, e.g., <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>, can list a summary of the <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> properties, as follows:

`` `python   # in axes.py   @_docstring.interpd   def plot(self, *args, **kwargs):       """       Some stuff omitted        Other Parameters       ----------------       scalex, scaley : bool, default: True           These parameters determine if the view limits are adapted to the           data limits. The values are passed on to `autoscale_view`.        **kwargs : `.Line2D` properties, optional           *kwargs* are used to specify properties like a line label (for           auto legends), linewidth, antialiasing, marker face color.           Example::            >>> plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3], 'go-', label='line 1', linewidth=2)           >>> plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 4, 9], 'rs', label='line 2')            If you specify multiple lines with one plot call, the kwargs apply           to all those lines. In case the label object is iterable, each           element is used as labels for each set of data.            Here is a list of available `.Line2D` properties:            %(Line2D:kwdoc)s       """  The ``%(Line2D:kwdoc)`syntax makes`interpd``lookup an `.Artist` subclass``<span class="title-ref"> named </span><span class="title-ref">Line2D</span><span class="title-ref">, and call </span>.artist.kwdoc\` on that class. <span class="title-ref">.artist.kwdoc</span> introspects the subclass and summarizes its properties as a substring, which gets interpolated into the docstring.

Note that this scheme does not work for decorating an Artist's `__init__`, as the subclass and its properties are not defined yet at that point. Instead, `@_docstring.interpd` can be used to decorate the class itself -- at that point, <span class="title-ref">.kwdoc</span> can list the properties and interpolate them into `__init__.__doc__`.

### Inherit docstrings

If a subclass overrides a method but does not change the semantics, we can reuse the parent docstring for the method of the child class. Python does this automatically, if the subclass method does not have a docstring.

Use a plain comment `# docstring inherited` to denote the intention to reuse the parent docstring. That way we do not accidentally create a docstring in the future:

    class A:
        def foo():
            """The parent docstring."""
            pass
    
    class B(A):
        def foo():
            # docstring inherited
            pass

### Add figures

As above (see \[rst-figures-and-includes\](\#rst-figures-and-includes)), figures in the examples gallery can be referenced with a `.. plot::` directive pointing to the python script that created the figure. For instance the <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.legend</span> docstring references the file `examples/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py`:

`` `python     """     ...      Examples     --------      .. plot:: gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/legend.py     """  Note that ``examples/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/legend.py`has been mapped to`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/legend.py</span>\`, a redirection that may be fixed in future re-organization of the docs.

Plots can also be directly placed inside docstrings. Details are in \[/api/sphinxext\_plot\_directive\_api\](/api/sphinxext\_plot\_directive\_api.md). A short example is:

`` `python     """     ...      Examples     --------      .. plot::        import matplotlib.image as mpimg        img = mpimg.imread('_static/stinkbug.png')        imgplot = plt.imshow(img)     """  An advantage of this style over referencing an example script is that the ``\` code will also appear in interactive docstrings.

## Write examples and tutorials

Examples and tutorials are Python scripts that are run by [Sphinx Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Sphinx Gallery finds `*.py` files in source directories and runs the files to create images and narrative that are embedded in `*.rst` files in a build location of the `doc/` directory. Files in the build location should not be directly edited as they will be overwritten by Sphinx gallery. Currently Matplotlib has four galleries as follows:

| Source location           | Build location      |
| ------------------------- | ------------------- |
| `galleries/plot_types`    | `doc/plot_types`    |
| `galleries/examples`      | `doc/gallery`       |
| `galleries/tutorials`     | `doc/tutorials`     |
| `galleries/users_explain` | `doc/users/explain` |

The first three are traditional galleries. The last, `galleries/users_explain`, is a mixed gallery where some of the files are raw `*.rst` files and some are `*.py` files; Sphinx Gallery just copies these `*.rst` files from the source location to the build location (see \[raw\_restructured\_gallery\](\#raw\_restructured\_gallery), below).

In the Python files, to exclude an example from having a plot generated, insert "sgskip" somewhere in the filename.

The format of these files is relatively straightforward. Properly formatted comment blocks are treated as [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) text, the code is displayed, and figures are put into the built page. Matplotlib uses the `# %%` section separator so that IDEs will identify "code cells" to make it easy to re-run sub-sections of the example.

For instance the example \[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/simple\_plot\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/simple\_plot.md) example is generated from `/galleries/examples/lines_bars_and_markers/simple_plot.py`, which looks like:

`` `python     """     ===========     Simple Plot     ===========      Create a simple plot.     """     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt     import numpy as np      # Data for plotting     t = np.arange(0.0, 2.0, 0.01)     s = 1 + np.sin(2 * np.pi * t)      # Note that using plt.subplots below is equivalent to using     # fig = plt.figure and then ax = fig.add_subplot(111)     fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.plot(t, s)      ax.set(xlabel='time (s)', ylabel='voltage (mV)',            title='About as simple as it gets, folks')     ax.grid()     plt.show()  The first comment block is treated as ReST_ text.  The other comment blocks ``\` render as comments in \[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/simple\_plot\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/simple\_plot.md).

Tutorials are made with the exact same mechanism, except they are longer and typically have more than one comment block (i.e. \[quick\_start\](\#quick\_start)). The first comment block can be the same as the example above. Subsequent blocks of ReST text are delimited by the line `# %%` :

`` `python     """     ===========     Simple Plot     ===========      Create a simple plot.     """     ...     ax.grid()     plt.show()      # %%     # Second plot     # ===========     #     # This is a second plot that is very nice      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.plot(np.sin(range(50)))  In this way text, code, and figures are output in a "notebook" style.  .. _sample-data:  Sample data ``\` -----------

When sample data comes from a public dataset, please cite the source of the data. Sample data should be written out in the code. When this is not feasible, the data can be loaded using <span class="title-ref">.cbook.get\_sample\_data</span>.

`` `python     import matplotlib.cbook as cbook     fh = cbook.get_sample_data('mydata.dat')   If the data is too large to be included in the code, it should be added to ``<span class="title-ref"> :file:\`lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/sample\_data/</span>

### Create mini-gallery

The showcased Matplotlib functions should be listed in an admonition at the bottom as follows

`` `python     # %%     #     # .. admonition:: References     #     #    The use of the following functions, methods, classes and modules is shown     #    in this example:     #     #    - `matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill` / `matplotlib.pyplot.fill`     #    - `matplotlib.axes.Axes.axis` / `matplotlib.pyplot.axis`  This allows sphinx-gallery to place an entry to the example in the ``<span class="title-ref"> mini-gallery of the mentioned functions. Whether or not a function is mentioned here should be decided depending on if a mini-gallery link prominently helps to illustrate that function; e.g. mention </span><span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span>\` only in examples that are about laying out subplots, not in every example that uses it.

Functions that exist in `pyplot` as well as in Axes or Figure should mention both references no matter which one is used in the example code. The `pyplot` reference should always be the second to mention; see the example above.

### Order examples

The order of the sections of the \[tutorials\](\#tutorials) and the \[gallery\](\#gallery), as well as the order of the examples within each section are determined in a two step process from within the `/doc/sphinxext/gallery_order.py`:

  - *Explicit order*: This file contains a list of folders for the section order and a list of examples for the subsection order. The order of the items shown in the doc pages is the order those items appear in those lists.
  - *Implicit order*: If a folder or example is not in those lists, it will be appended after the explicitly ordered items and all of those additional items will be ordered by pathname (for the sections) or by filename (for the subsections).

As a consequence, if you want to let your example appear in a certain position in the gallery, extend those lists with your example. In case no explicit order is desired or necessary, still make sure to name your example consistently, i.e. use the main function or subject of the example as first word in the filename; e.g. an image example should ideally be named similar to `imshow_mynewexample.py`.

### Raw restructured text files in the gallery

[Sphinx Gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) folders usually consist of a `README.txt` and a series of Python source files that are then translated to an `index.rst` file and a series of `example_name.rst` files in the `doc/` subdirectories. However, Sphinx Gallery also allows raw `*.rst` files to be passed through a gallery (see [Manually passing files](https://sphinx-gallery.github.io/stable/configuration.html#manually-passing-files) in the Sphinx Gallery documentation). We use this feature in `galleries/users_explain`, where, for instance, `galleries/users_explain/colors` is a regular Sphinx Gallery subdirectory, but `galleries/users_explain/artists` has a mix of `*.rst` and `*py` files. For mixed subdirectories like this, we must add any `*.rst` files to a `:toctree:`, either in the `README.txt` or in a manual `index.rst`.

### Examples guidelines

The gallery of examples contains visual demonstrations of matplotlib features. Gallery examples exist so that users can scan through visual examples. Unlike tutorials or user guides, gallery examples teach by demonstration, rather than by explanation or instruction.

Gallery examples should contain a very brief description of *what* is being demonstrated and, when relevant, *how* it is achieved. Explanations should be brief, providing only the minimal context necessary for understanding the example. Cross-link related documentation (e.g. tutorials, user guides and API entries) and tag the example with related concepts.

#### Format

All \[examples-index\](\#examples-index) should aim to follow these guidelines:

  - Title  
    Describe content in a short sentence (approx. 1-6 words). Do not use *demo* as this is implied by being an example. Avoid implied verbs such as *create*, *make*, etc, e.g. *annotated heatmaps* is preferred to *create annotated heatmaps*. Use the simple present tense when a verb is necessary, e.g. *Fill the area between two curves*

  - Description  
    In a short paragraph (approx 1-3 sentences) describe what visualization technique is being demonstrated and how library features are used to execute the technique, e.g. *Set bar color and bar label entries using the color and label parameters of \~Axes.bar*

  - Plot  
    Clearly demonstrate the subject and, when possible, show edge cases and different applications. While the plot should be visually appealing, prioritize keeping the plot uncluttered.

  - Code  
    Write the minimum necessary to showcase the feature that is the focus of the example. Avoid custom styling and annotation (titles, legends, colors, etc.) when it will not improve the clarity of the example.
    
    Use short comments sparingly to describe what hard to follow parts of code are doing. When more context or explanation is required, add a text paragraph before the code example.

\[/gallery/misc/bbox\_intersect\](/gallery/misc/bbox\_intersect.md) demonstrates the point of visual examples. This example is "messy" in that it's hard to categorize, but the gallery is the right spot for it because it makes sense to find it by visual search

\[/gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/colormap\_interactive\_adjustment\](/gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/colormap\_interactive\_adjustment.md) is an example of a good descriptive title that briefly summarizes how the showcased library features are used to implement the demonstrated visualization technique.

\[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/lines\_with\_ticks\_demo\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/lines\_with\_ticks\_demo.md) is an example of having a minimal amount of code necessary to showcase the feature. The lack of extraneous code makes it easier for the reader to map which parts of code correspond to which parts of the plot.

#### Figure size

When customizing figure sizes, we aim to avoid downscaling in rendered HTML docs. The current width limit (induced by *pydata-sphinx-theme*) is 720px, i.e. `figsize=(7.2, ...)`, or 896px if the page does not have subsections and thus does not have the "On this page" navigation on the right-hand side.

## Miscellaneous

### Move documentation

Sometimes it is desirable to move or consolidate documentation. With no action this will lead to links either going dead (404) or pointing to old versions of the documentation. Preferable is to replace the old page with an html refresh that immediately redirects the viewer to the new page. So, for example we move `/doc/topic/old_info.rst` to `/doc/topic/new_info.rst`. We remove `/doc/topic/old_info.rst` and in `/doc/topic/new_info.rst` we insert a `redirect-from` directive that tells sphinx to still make the old file with the html refresh/redirect in it (probably near the top of the file to make it noticeable)

`` `rst    .. redirect-from:: /topic/old_info  In the built docs this will yield an html file ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">/build/html/topic/old\_info.html</span><span class="title-ref"> that has a refresh to </span><span class="title-ref">new\_info.html</span>\`. If the two files are in different subdirectories:

`` `rst    .. redirect-from:: /old_topic/old_info2  will yield an html file ``/build/html/old\_topic/old\_info2.html`that has a`<span class="title-ref"> (relative) refresh to </span><span class="title-ref">../topic/new\_info.html</span>\`.

Use the full path for this directive, relative to the doc root at `https://matplotlib.org/stable/`. So `/old_topic/old_info2` would be found by users at `http://matplotlib.org/stable/old_topic/old_info2`. For clarity, do not use relative links.

### Generate inheritance diagrams

Class inheritance diagrams can be generated with the Sphinx [inheritance-diagram](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/inheritance.html) directive.

Example:

`` `rst     .. inheritance-diagram:: matplotlib.patches matplotlib.lines matplotlib.text        :parts: 2  .. inheritance-diagram:: matplotlib.patches matplotlib.lines matplotlib.text    :parts: 2   Navbar and style ``\` ----------------

Matplotlib has a few subprojects that share the same navbar and style, so these are centralized as a sphinx theme at [mpl\_sphinx\_theme](https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-sphinx-theme). Changes to the style or topbar should be made there to propagate across all subprojects.

# Licenses for contributed code

Matplotlib only uses BSD compatible code. If you bring in code from another project make sure it has a PSF, BSD, MIT or compatible license (see the Open Source Initiative [licenses page](https://opensource.org/licenses) for details on individual licenses). If it doesn't, you may consider contacting the author and asking them to relicense it. GPL and LGPL code are not acceptable in the main code base, though we are considering an alternative way of distributing L/GPL code through an separate channel, possibly a toolkit. If you include code, make sure you include a copy of that code's license in the license directory if the code's license requires you to distribute the license with it. Non-BSD compatible licenses are acceptable in Matplotlib toolkits (e.g., basemap), but make sure you clearly state the licenses you are using.

## Why BSD compatible?

The two dominant license variants in the wild are GPL-style and BSD-style. There are countless other licenses that place specific restrictions on code reuse, but there is an important difference to be considered in the GPL and BSD variants. The best known and perhaps most widely used license is the GPL, which in addition to granting you full rights to the source code including redistribution, carries with it an extra obligation. If you use GPL code in your own code, or link with it, your product must be released under a GPL compatible license. i.e., you are required to give the source code to other people and give them the right to redistribute it as well. Many of the most famous and widely used open source projects are released under the GPL, including linux, gcc, emacs and sage.

The second major class are the BSD-style licenses (which includes MIT and the python PSF license). These basically allow you to do whatever you want with the code: ignore it, include it in your own open source project, include it in your proprietary product, sell it, whatever. python itself is released under a BSD compatible license, in the sense that, quoting from the PSF license page:

    There is no GPL-like "copyleft" restriction. Distributing
    binary-only versions of Python, modified or not, is allowed. There
    is no requirement to release any of your source code. You can also
    write extension modules for Python and provide them only in binary
    form.

Famous projects released under a BSD-style license in the permissive sense of the last paragraph are the BSD operating system, python and TeX.

There are several reasons why early Matplotlib developers selected a BSD compatible license. Matplotlib is a python extension, and we choose a license that was based on the python license (BSD compatible). Also, we wanted to attract as many users and developers as possible, and many software companies will not use GPL code in software they plan to distribute, even those that are highly committed to open source development, such as [enthought](https://www.enthought.com), out of legitimate concern that use of the GPL will "infect" their code base by its viral nature. In effect, they want to retain the right to release some proprietary code. Companies and institutions who use Matplotlib often make significant contributions, because they have the resources to get a job done, even a boring one. Two of the Matplotlib backends (FLTK and WX) were contributed by private companies. The final reason behind the licensing choice is compatibility with the other python extensions for scientific computing: ipython, numpy, scipy, the enthought tool suite and python itself are all distributed under BSD compatible licenses.

# Dependency version policy

For the purpose of this document, 'minor version' is in the sense of SemVer (major, minor, patch) or 'meso version' in the sense of [EffVer](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) (macro, meso, micro). It includes both major/macro and minor/meso releases. For projects that use date-based versioning, every release is a 'minor version'.

Matplotlib follows [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html).

## Python and NumPy

Matplotlib supports:

  - All minor versions of Python released 42 months prior to the project, and at minimum the two latest minor versions.
  - All minor versions of `numpy` released in the 24 months prior to the project, and at minimum the last three minor versions.

In `pyproject.toml`, the `requires-python` variable should be set to the minimum supported version of Python. All supported minor versions of Python should be in the test matrix and have binary artifacts built for the release.

Minimum Python and NumPy version support should be adjusted upward on every major and minor release, but never on a patch release.

See also the \[list-of-dependency-min-versions\](\#list-of-dependency-min-versions).

## Python dependencies

For Python dependencies we should support at least:

  - with compiled extensions  
    minor versions initially released in the 24 months prior to our planned release date or the oldest that support our minimum Python + NumPy

  - without compiled extensions  
    minor versions initially released in the 12 months prior to our planned release date or the oldest that supports our minimum Python.

We will only bump these dependencies as we need new features or the old versions no longer support our minimum NumPy or Python.

We will work around bugs in our dependencies when practical.

IPython and Matplotlib do not formally depend on each other, however there is practical coupling for the integration of Matplotlib's UI into IPython and IPykernel. We will ensure this integration works with at least minor or major versions of IPython and IPykernel released in the 24 months prior to our planned release date. Matplotlib may or may not work with older versions and we will not warn if used with IPython or IPykernel outside of this window.

## Test and documentation dependencies

As these packages are only needed for testing or building the docs and not needed by end-users, we can be more aggressive about dropping support for old versions. However, we need to be careful to not over-run what down-stream packagers support (as most of the run the tests and build the documentation as part of the packaging process).

We will support at least minor versions of the development dependencies released in the 12 months prior to our planned release. Specific versions that are known to be buggy may be excluded from support using the finest-grained filtering that is practical.

We will only bump these as needed or versions no longer support our minimum Python and NumPy.

## System and C-dependencies

For system or C-dependencies (FreeType, GUI frameworks, LaTeX, Ghostscript, FFmpeg) support as old as practical. These can be difficult to install for end-users and we want to be usable on as many systems as possible. We will bump these on a case-by-case basis.

In the case of GUI frameworks for which we rely on Python bindings being available, we will also drop support for bindings so old that they don't support any Python version that we support.

## Security issues in dependencies

Generally, we do not adjust the supported versions of dependencies based on security vulnerabilities. We are a library not an application and the version constraints on our dependencies indicate what will work (not what is wise to use). Users and packagers can install newer versions of the dependencies at their discretion and evaluation of risk and impact. In contrast, if we were to adjust our minimum supported version it is very hard for a user to override our judgment.

If Matplotlib aids in exploiting the underlying vulnerability we should treat that as a critical bug in Matplotlib.

## List of dependency versions

</div>

**Please help review and merge PRs\!**

If you have commit rights, then you are trusted to use them. Please be patient and [kind](https://youtu.be/tzFWz5fiVKU?t=49m30s) with contributors.

When reviewing, please ensure that the pull request satisfies the following requirements before merging it:

### Content

<div class="rst-class">

checklist

</div>

  - Is the feature / bugfix reasonable?
  - Does the PR conform with the \[coding\_guidelines\](\#coding\_guidelines)?
  - Is the \[documentation \<pr-documentation\>\](\#documentation-\<pr-documentation\>) (docstrings, examples, what's new, API changes) updated?
  - Is the change purely stylistic? Generally, such changes are discouraged when not part of other non-stylistic work because it obscures the git history of functional changes to the code. Reflowing a method or docstring as part of a larger refactor/rewrite is acceptable.

### Workflow

<div class="rst-class">

checklist

</div>

  - Make sure all \[automated tests \<pr-automated-tests\>\](\#automated-tests-\<pr-automated-tests\>) pass.
  - The PR should \[target the main branch \<pr-branch-selection\>\](\#target-the-main-branch-\<pr-branch-selection\>).
  - Tag with descriptive \[labels \<pr-labels\>\](\#labels-\<pr-labels\>).
  - Set the \[milestone \<pr-milestones\>\](\#milestone-\<pr-milestones\>).
  - Keep an eye on the \[number of commits \<pr-squashing\>\](\#number-of-commits-\<pr-squashing\>).
  - Approve if all of the above topics are handled.
  - \[Merge \<pr-merging\>\](\#merge--\<pr-merging\>) if a sufficient number of approvals is reached.

## Detailed guidelines

### Documentation

  - Every new feature should be documented. If it's a new module, don't forget to add a new rst file to the API docs.
  - Each high-level plotting function should have a small example in the `Examples` section of the docstring. This should be as simple as possible to demonstrate the method. More complex examples should go into a dedicated example file in the `examples` directory, which will be rendered to the examples gallery in the documentation.
  - Build the docs and make sure all formatting warnings are addressed.
  - See \[documenting-matplotlib\](\#documenting-matplotlib) for our documentation style guide.

### Labels

  - If you have the rights to set labels, tag the PR with descriptive labels. See the [list of labels](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels).
  - If the PR makes changes to the wheel building Action, add the "Run cibuildwheel" label to enable testing wheels.

### Milestones

Set the milestone according to these guidelines:

  - *New features and API changes* are milestoned for the next meso release `v3.N.0`.
  - *Bugfixes, tests for released code, and docstring changes* may be milestoned for the next micro release `v3.N.M`.
  - *Documentation changes* (only .rst files and examples) may be milestoned `v3.N-doc`.

If multiple rules apply, choose the first matching from the above list. See \[backport-strategy\](\#backport-strategy) for detailed guidance on what should or should not be backported.

The milestone marks the release a PR should go into. It states intent, but can be changed because of release planning or re-evaluation of the PR scope and maturity.

All Pull Requests should target the main branch. The milestone tag triggers an \[automatic backport \<automated-backports\>\](\#automatic-backport-\<automated-backports\>) for milestones which have a corresponding branch.

### Merging

As a guiding principle, we require two [approvals](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-pull-requests/reviewing-changes-in-pull-requests) from core developers (those with commit rights) before merging a pull request. This two-pairs-of-eyes strategy shall ensure a consistent project direction and prevent accidental mistakes. It is permissible to merge with one approval if the change is not fundamental and can easily be reverted at any time in the future.

Some explicit rules following from this:

  - *Documentation and examples* may be merged with a single approval. Use the threshold "is this better than it was?" as the review criteria.

  - Minor *infrastructure updates*, e.g. temporary pinning of broken dependencies or small changes to the CI configuration, may be merged with a single approval.

  - *Code changes* (anything in `src` or `lib`) must have two approvals.
    
    Ensure that all API changes are documented in a file in one of the subdirectories of `doc/api/next_api_changes`, and significant new features have an entry in `doc/user/whats_new`.
    
      - If a PR already has a positive review, a core developer (e.g. the first reviewer, but not necessarily) may champion that PR for merging. In order to do so, they should ping all core devs both on GitHub and on the dev mailing list, and label the PR with the "Merge with single review?" label. Other core devs can then either review the PR and merge or reject it, or simply request that it gets a second review before being merged. If no one asks for such a second review within a week, the PR can then be merged on the basis of that single review.
        
        A core dev should only champion one PR at a time and we should try to keep the flow of championed PRs reasonable.

After giving the last required approval, the author of the approval should merge the PR. PR authors should not self-merge except for when another reviewer explicitly allows it (e.g., "Approve modulo CI passing, may self merge when green", or "Take or leave the comments. You may self merge".).

### Automated tests

Before being merged, a PR should pass the \[automated-tests\](\#automated-tests). If you are unsure why a test is failing, ask on the PR or in our \[communication-channels\](\#communication-channels)

### Number of commits and squashing

  - Squashing is case-by-case. The balance is between burden on the contributor, keeping a relatively clean history, and keeping a history usable for bisecting. The only time we are really strict about it is to eliminate binary files (ex multiple test image re-generations) and to remove upstream merges.
  - Do not let perfect be the enemy of the good, particularly for documentation or example PRs. If you find yourself making many small suggestions, either open a PR against the original branch, push changes to the contributor branch, or merge the PR and then open a new PR against upstream.
  - If you push to a contributor branch leave a comment explaining what you did, ex "I took the liberty of pushing a small clean-up PR to your branch, thanks for your work.". If you are going to make substantial changes to the code or intent of the PR please check with the contributor first.

## Branches and backports

### Current branches

The current active branches are

  - *main*  
    The current development version. Future meso (*v3.N.0*) or macro (*v4.0.0*) will be branched from this.

  - *v3.N.x*  
    Maintenance branch for Matplotlib 3.N. Future micro releases will be tagged from this.

  - *v3.N.M-doc*  
    Documentation for the current micro release. On a micro release, this will be replaced by a properly named branch for the new release.

### Branch selection for pull requests

Generally, all pull requests should target the main branch.

Other branches are fed through \[automatic \<automated-backports\>\](\#automatic-\<automated-backports\>) or \[manual \<manual-backports\>\](\#manual-\<manual-backports\>). Directly targeting other branches is only rarely necessary for special maintenance work.

### Backport strategy

Backports to the micro release branch (*v3.N.x*) are the changes that will be included in the next patch (aka bug-fix) release. The goal of the patch releases is to fix bugs without adding any new regressions or behavior changes. We will always attempt to backport:

  - critical bug fixes (segfault, failure to import, things that the user cannot work around)
  - fixes for regressions introduced in the last two meso releases

and may attempt to backport fixes for regressions introduced in older releases.

In the case where the backport is not clean, for example if the bug fix is built on top of other code changes we do not want to backport, balance the effort and risk of re-implementing the bug fix vs the severity of the bug. When in doubt, err on the side of not backporting.

When backporting a Pull Request fails or is declined, re-milestone the original PR to the next meso release and leave a comment explaining why.

The only changes backported to the documentation branch (*v3.N.M-doc*) are changes to `doc` or `galleries`. Any changes to `lib` or `src`, including docstring-only changes, must not be backported to this branch.

### Automated backports

We use MeeseeksDev bot to automatically backport merges to the correct maintenance branch base on the milestone. To work properly the milestone must be set before merging. If you have commit rights, the bot can also be manually triggered after a merge by leaving a message `@meeseeksdev backport to BRANCH` on the PR. If there are conflicts MeeseeksDev will inform you that the backport needs to be done manually.

The target branch is configured by putting `on-merge: backport to TARGETBRANCH` in the milestone description on it's own line.

If the bot is not working as expected, please report issues to [MeeseeksDev](https://github.com/MeeseeksBox/MeeseeksDev).

### Manual backports

When doing backports please copy the form used by MeeseeksDev, `Backport PR #XXXX: TITLE OF PR`. If you need to manually resolve conflicts make note of them and how you resolved them in the commit message.

We do a backport from main to v2.2.x assuming:

  - `matplotlib` is a read-only remote branch of the matplotlib/matplotlib repo

The `TARGET_SHA` is the hash of the merge commit you would like to backport. This can be read off of the GitHub PR page (in the UI with the merge notification) or through the git CLI tools.

Assuming that you already have a local branch `v2.2.x` (if not, then `git checkout -b v2.2.x`), and that your remote pointing to `https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib` is called `upstream`:

`` `bash    git fetch upstream    git checkout v2.2.x  # or include -b if you don't already have this.    git reset --hard upstream/v2.2.x    git cherry-pick -m 1 TARGET_SHA    # resolve conflicts and commit if required  Files with conflicts can be listed by ``git status`,`<span class="title-ref"> and will have to be fixed by hand (search on </span><span class="title-ref">\>\>\>\>\></span>\`). Once the conflict is resolved, you will have to re-add the file(s) to the branch and then continue the cherry pick:

`` `bash    git add lib/matplotlib/conflicted_file.py    git add lib/matplotlib/conflicted_file2.py    git cherry-pick --continue  Use your discretion to push directly to upstream or to open a PR; be ``<span class="title-ref"> sure to push or PR against the </span><span class="title-ref">v2.2.x</span><span class="title-ref"> upstream branch, not </span><span class="title-ref">main</span>\`\!

# Release guide

<div class="admonition">

This document is only relevant for Matplotlib release managers.

A guide for developers who are doing a Matplotlib release.

</div>

## Versioning Scheme

Matplotlib follows the [Intended Effort Versioning (EffVer)](https://jacobtomlinson.dev/effver/) versioning scheme: *macro.meso.micro*.

  - *macro*  
    A release that we expect a large effort from our users to upgrade to. The v1 to v2 transition included a complete overhaul of the default styles and the v2 to v3 transition involved dropping support for Python 2.
    
    Future macro versions would include changes of a comparable scale that can not be done incrementally in meso releases.

  - *meso*  
    A release that we expect some effort from our users to upgrade to. We target a *Meso* release every 6 months. These release are primarily intended to release new features to our users, however they also contain intentional feature deprecations and removals per \[our policy \<deprecation-guidelines\>\](\#our-policy-\<deprecation-guidelines\>).

  - *micro*  
    A release that we expect users to require little to no effort to upgrade to. Per our \[backport-strategy\](\#backport-strategy) we only backport bug fixes to the maintenance branch. We expect minimal impact on users other than possibly breaking work arounds to a fixed bug or [bugs being used as features](https://xkcd.com/1172/).
    
    These are released as-needed, but typically every 1-2 months between meso releases.

## Making the release branch

\> **Note** \> This assumes that a read-only remote for the canonical repository is `remote` and a read/write remote is `DANGER`

When a new meso release (vX.Y.0) is approaching, a new release branch must be made. When precisely this should happen is up to the release manager, but this point is where most new features intended for the meso release are merged and you are entering a feature freeze (i.e. newly implemented features will be going into vX.Y+1). This does not necessarily mean that no further changes will be made prior to release, just that those changes will be made using the backport system.

For an upcoming `v3.7.0` release, first create the branch:

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c v3.7.x
git push DANGER v3.7.x
```

Update the `v3.7.0` milestone so that the description reads:

``` bash
New features and API changes

on-merge: backport to v3.7.x
```

Micro versions should instead read:

``` bash
Bugfixes and docstring changes

on-merge: backport to v3.7.x
```

Check all active milestones for consistency. Older milestones should also backport to higher meso versions (e.g. `v3.6.3` and `v3.6-doc` should backport to both `v3.6.x` and `v3.7.x` once the `v3.7.x` branch exists and while PR backports are still targeting `v3.6.x`)

Create the milestone for the next-next meso release (i.e. `v3.9.0`, as `v3.8.0` should already exist). While most active items should go in the next meso release, this milestone can help with longer term planning, especially around deprecation cycles.

## Testing

We use [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/actions) for continuous integration. When preparing for a release, the final tagged commit should be tested locally before it is uploaded:

``` bash
pytest -n 8 .
```

In addition the following test should be run and manually inspected:

``` bash
python tools/memleak.py agg 1000 agg.pdf
```

Run the User Acceptance Tests for the NBAgg and ipympl backends:

``` bash
jupyter notebook lib/matplotlib/backends/web_backend/nbagg_uat.ipynb
```

For ipympl, restart the kernel, add a cell for `%matplotlib widget` and do not run the cell with `matplotlib.use('nbagg')`. Tests which check `connection_info`, use `reshow`, or test the OO interface are not expected to work for `ipympl`.

## GitHub statistics

We automatically extract GitHub issue, PRs, and authors from GitHub via the API. To prepare this list:

1.  Archive the existing GitHub statistics page.
    
    1.  Copy the current `doc/users/github_stats.rst` to `doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_{X}.{Y}.{Z}.rst`.
    2.  Change the link target at the top of the file.
    3.  Remove the "Previous GitHub Stats" section at the end.
    
    For example, when updating from v3.7.0 to v3.7.1:
    
    ``` bash
    cp doc/users/github_stats.rst doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.7.0.rst
    $EDITOR doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.7.0.rst
    # Change contents as noted above.
    git add doc/users/prev_whats_new/github_stats_3.7.0.rst
    ```

2.  Re-generate the updated stats:
    
    ``` bash
    python tools/github_stats.py --since-tag v3.7.0 --milestone=v3.7.1 \
        --project 'matplotlib/matplotlib' --links > doc/users/github_stats.rst
    ```

3.  Review and commit changes. Some issue/PR titles may not be valid reST (the most common issue is `*` which is interpreted as unclosed markup). Also confirm that `codespell` does not find any issues.

\> **Note** \> Make sure you authenticate against the GitHub API. If you do not, you will get blocked by GitHub for going over the API rate limits. You can authenticate in one of two ways:

>   - using the `keyring` package; `pip install keyring` and then when running the stats script, you will be prompted for user name and password, that will be stored in your system keyring, or,
>   - using a personal access token; generate a new token [on this GitHub page](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with the `repo:public_repo` scope and place the token in `~/.ghoauth`.

## Update and validate the docs

### Merge `*-doc` branch

Merge the most recent 'doc' branch (e.g., `v3.7.0-doc`) into the branch you are going to tag on and delete the doc branch on GitHub.

### Update supported versions in Security Policy

When making macro or meso releases, update the supported versions in the Security Policy in `SECURITY.md`.

For meso version release update the table in `SECURITY.md` to specify that the two most recent meso releases in the current macro version series are supported.

For a macro version release update the table in `SECURITY.md` to specify that the last meso version in the previous macro version series is still supported. Dropping support for the last version of a macro version series will be handled on an ad-hoc basis.

### Update release notes

#### What's new

*Only needed for macro and meso releases. Bugfix releases should not have new features.*

Merge the contents of all the files in `doc/users/next_whats_new/` into a single file `doc/users/prev_whats_new/whats_new_{X}.{Y}.0.rst` and delete the individual files.

#### API changes

*Primarily needed for macro and meso releases. We may sometimes have API changes in micro releases.*

Merge the contents of all the files in `doc/api/next_api_changes/` into a single file `doc/api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_{X}.{Y}.{Z}.rst` and delete the individual files.

#### Release notes TOC

Update `doc/users/release_notes.rst`:

  - For macro and meso releases add a new section
    
    ``` rst
    X.Y
    ===
    .. toctree::
        :maxdepth: 1
    
        prev_whats_new/whats_new_X.Y.0.rst
        ../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.0.rst
        prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.0.rst
    ```

  - For micro releases add the GitHub stats and (if present) the API changes to the existing X.Y section
    
    ``` rst
    ../api/prev_api_changes/api_changes_X.Y.Z.rst
    prev_whats_new/github_stats_X.Y.Z.rst
    ```

#### Update version switcher

Update `doc/_static/switcher.json`:

  - If a micro release, `{X}.{Y}.{Z}`, no changes are needed.
  - If a meso release, `{X}.{Y}.0`, change the name of `name: {X}.{Y+1} (dev)` and `name: {X}.{Y} (stable)` as well as adding a new version for the previous stable (`name: {X}.{Y-1}`).

### Verify that docs build

Finally, make sure that the docs build cleanly:

``` bash
make -Cdoc O=-j$(nproc) html latexpdf
```

After the docs are built, check that all of the links, internal and external, are still valid. We use `linkchecker` for this:

``` bash
pip install linkchecker
pushd doc/build/html
linkchecker index.html --check-extern
popd
```

Address any issues which may arise. The internal links are checked on Circle CI, so this should only flag failed external links.

## Create release commit and tag

To create the tag, first create an empty commit with a very terse set of the release notes in the commit message:

``` bash
git commit --allow-empty
```

and then create a signed, annotated tag with the same text in the body message:

``` bash
git tag -a -s v3.7.0
```

which will prompt you for your GPG key password and an annotation. For pre-releases it is important to follow `440` so that the build artifacts will sort correctly in PyPI.

To prevent issues with any down-stream builders which download the tarball from GitHub it is important to move all branches away from the commit with the tag\[1\]:

``` bash
git commit --allow-empty
```

Finally, push the tag to GitHub:

``` bash
git push DANGER v3.7.x v3.7.0
```

Congratulations, the scariest part is done\! This assumes the release branch has already been made. Usually this is done at the time of feature freeze for a meso release (which often coincides with the last micro release of the previous meso version)

If this is a final release, also create a 'doc' branch (this is not done for pre-releases):

``` bash
git branch v3.7.0-doc
git push DANGER v3.7.0-doc
```

Update (or create) the `v3.7-doc` milestone. The description should include the instruction for meeseeksmachine to backport changes with the `v3.7-doc` milestone to both the `v3.7.x` branch and the `v3.7.0-doc` branch:

``` bash
Documentation changes (.rst files and examples)

on-merge: backport to v3.7.x
on-merge: backport to v3.7.0-doc
```

Check all active milestones for consistency. Older doc milestones should also backport to higher meso versions (e.g. `v3.6-doc` should backport to both `v3.6.x` and `v3.7.x` if the `v3.7.x` branch exists)

## Release management / DOI

Via the [GitHub UI](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/releases), turn the newly pushed tag into a release. If this is a pre-release remember to mark it as such.

For final releases, also get the DOI from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/) (which will automatically produce one once the tag is pushed). Add the DOI post-fix and version to the dictionary in `tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py` and run the script.

This will download the new SVG to `doc/_static/zenodo_cache/{postfix}.svg` and edit `doc/project/citing.rst`. Commit the new SVG, the change to `tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py`, and the changes to `doc/project/citing.rst` to the VER-doc branch and push to GitHub. :

``` bash
git checkout v3.7.0-doc
$EDITOR tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py
python tools/cache_zenodo_svg.py
git commit -a
git push DANGER v3.7.0-doc:v3.7.0-doc
```

## Building binaries

We distribute macOS, Windows, and many Linux wheels as well as a source tarball via PyPI. Most builders should trigger automatically once the tag is pushed to GitHub:

  - Windows, macOS and manylinux wheels are built on GitHub Actions. Builds are triggered by the GitHub Action defined in `.github/workflows/cibuildwheel.yml`, and wheels will be available as artifacts of the build. Both a source tarball and the wheels will be automatically uploaded to PyPI once all of them have been built.
  - The auto-tick bot should open a pull request into the [conda-forge feedstock](https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock). Review and merge (if you have the power to).

\> **Warning** \> Because this is automated, it is extremely important to bump all branches away from the tag as discussed in \[release\_tag\](\#release\_tag).

## Manually uploading to PyPI

\> **Note** \> As noted above, the GitHub Actions workflow should build and upload source tarballs and wheels automatically. If for some reason, you need to upload these artifacts manually, then follow the instructions in this section.

Once you have collected all of the wheels (expect this to take a few hours), generate the tarball:

``` bash
git checkout v3.7.0
git clean -xfd
python -m build --sdist
```

and copy all of the wheels into `dist` directory. First, check that the dist files are OK:

``` bash
twine check dist/*
```

and then use `twine` to upload all of the files to PyPI :

``` bash
twine upload -s dist/matplotlib*tar.gz
twine upload dist/*whl
```

Congratulations, you have now done the second scariest part\!

## Build and deploy documentation

To build the documentation you must have the tagged version installed, but build the docs from the `ver-doc` branch. An easy way to arrange this is:

``` bash
pip install matplotlib
pip install -r requirements/doc/doc-requirements.txt
git checkout v3.7.0-doc
git clean -xfd
make -Cdoc O="-t release -j$(nproc)" html latexpdf LATEXMKOPTS="-silent -f"
```

which will build both the HTML and PDF version of the documentation.

The built documentation exists in the [matplotlib.github.com](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib.github.com/) repository. Pushing changes to main automatically updates the website.

The documentation is organized in subdirectories by version. The latest stable release is symlinked from the `stable` directory. The documentation for current main is built on Circle CI and pushed to the [devdocs](https://github.com/matplotlib/devdocs/) repository. These are available at [matplotlib.org/devdocs](https://matplotlib.org/devdocs/).

Assuming you have this repository checked out in the same directory as matplotlib :

``` bash
cd ../matplotlib.github.com
cp -a ../matplotlib/doc/build/html 3.7.0
rm 3.7.0/.buildinfo
cp ../matplotlib/doc/build/latex/Matplotlib.pdf 3.7.0
```

which will copy the built docs over. If this is a final release, link the `stable` subdirectory to the newest version:

``` bash
rm stable
ln -s 3.7.0 stable
```

You will also need to edit `sitemap.xml` and `versions.html` to include the newly released version. Now commit and push everything to GitHub :

``` bash
git add *
git commit -a -m 'Updating docs for v3.7.0'
git push DANGER main
```

Congratulations you have now done the third scariest part\!

If you have access, clear the CloudFlare caches.

It typically takes about 5-10 minutes for the website to process the push and update the live web page (remember to clear your browser cache).

## Merge up changes to main

After a release is done, the changes from the release branch should be merged into the `main` branch. This is primarily done so that the released tag is on the main branch so `git describe` (and thus `setuptools-scm`) has the most current tag. Secondarily, changes made during release (including removing individualized release notes, fixing broken links, and updating the version switcher) are bubbled up to `main`.

Git conflicts are very likely to arise, though aside from changes made directly to the release branch (mostly as part of the release), they should be relatively-easily resolved by using the version from `main`. This is not a universal rule, and care should be taken to ensure correctness:

``` bash
git switch main
git pull
git switch -c merge_up_v3.7.0
git merge v3.7.x
# resolve conflicts
git merge --continue
```

Due to branch protections for the `main` branch, this is merged via a standard pull request, though the PR cleanliness status check is expected to fail. The PR should not be squashed because the intent is to merge the branch histories.

## Publicize this release

After the release is published to PyPI and conda, it should be announced through our communication channels:

<div class="rst-class">

checklist

</div>

  - Send a short version of the release notes and acknowledgments to all the \[mailing-lists\](\#mailing-lists)
  - Post highlights and link to \[What's new \<release-notes\>\](\#what's-new-\<release-notes\>) on the active \[social media accounts \<social-media\>\](\#social-media-accounts-\<social-media\>)
  - Add a release announcement to the "News" section of [matplotlib.org](https://github.com/matplotlib/mpl-brochure-site) by editing `docs/body.html`. Link to the auto-generated announcement discourse post, which is in [Announcements \> matplotlib-announcements](https://discourse.matplotlib.org/c/announce/matplotlib-announce/10).

## Conda packages

The Matplotlib project itself does not release conda packages. In particular, the Matplotlib release manager is not responsible for conda packaging.

For information on the packaging of Matplotlib for conda-forge see <https://github.com/conda-forge/matplotlib-feedstock>.

1.  The tarball that is provided by GitHub is produced using [git archive](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-archive). We use [setuptools\_scm](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm) which uses a format string in `lib/matplotlib/_version.py` to have `git` insert a list of references to exported commit (see `.gitattributes` for the configuration). This string is then used by `setuptools_scm` to produce the correct version, based on the git tag, when users install from the tarball. However, if there is a branch pointed at the tagged commit, then the branch name will also be included in the tarball. When the branch eventually moves, anyone who checked the hash of the tarball before the branch moved will have an incorrect hash.
    
    To generate the file that GitHub does use:
    
    ``` bash
    git archive v3.7.0 -o matplotlib-3.7.0.tar.gz --prefix=matplotlib-3.7.0/
    ```

## Formatting

The following guidelines specify how to incorporate code and use appropriate formatting for Matplotlib documentation.

### Code

Matplotlib is a Python library and follows the same standards for documentation.

#### Comments

Examples of Python code have comments before or on the same line.

#### Outputs

When generating visuals with Matplotlib using `.py` files in examples, display the visual with <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.show</span> to display the visual. Keep the documentation clear of Python output lines.

<table style="width:143%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 71%" />
<col style="width: 71%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Correct</th>
<th>Incorrect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><pre><code>plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
plt.show()</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>plt.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])</code></pre></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><pre><code>fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])
fig.show()</code></pre></td>
<td><pre><code>fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax.plot([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 3])</code></pre></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

### reStructuredText

Matplotlib uses reStructuredText Markup for documentation. Sphinx helps to transform these documents into appropriate formats for accessibility and visibility.

  - [reStructuredText Specifications](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/ref/rst/restructuredtext.html)
  - [Quick Reference Document](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/docs/user/rst/quickref.html)

#### Lists

Bulleted lists are for items that do not require sequencing. Numbered lists are exclusively for performing actions in a determined order.

<table style="width:143%;">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 71%" />
<col style="width: 71%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Correct</th>
<th>Incorrect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td>The example uses three graphs.</td>
<td>The example uses three graphs.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><ul>

<li>Line</li>
<li>Pie</li>
</ul></td>
<td><ol type="1">
<li>Bar</li>
<li>Line</li>
<li>Pie</li>
</ol></td>
</tr>
<tr class="odd">
<td>These four steps help to get started using Matplotlib.</td>
<td>The following steps are important to get started using Matplotlib.</td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><blockquote>
<ol type="1">
<li>Import the Matplotlib library.</li>
<li>Import the necessary modules.</li>
<li>Set and assign data to work on.</li>
<li>Transform data with methods and functions.</li>
</ol>
</blockquote></td>
<td><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Import the Matplotlib library.</li>
<li>Import the necessary modules.</li>
<li>Set and assign data to work on.</li>
<li>Transform data with methods and functions.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

#### Tables

Use ASCII tables with reStructuredText standards in organizing content. Markdown tables and the csv-table directive are not accepted.

## Domain tags: what discipline(s) might seek this example consistently?

It's futile to draw fences around "who owns what", and that's not the point of domain tags. See below for a list of existing domain tags. If you don't see the one you're looking for and you think it should exist, consider proposing it.

| `tag`                       | use case                          |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| `domain`                    | for whom is the example relevant? |
| `domain: cartography`       |                                   |
| `domain: geometry`          |                                   |
| `domain: statistics`        |                                   |
| `domain: oceanography`      |                                   |
| `domain: signal-processing` |                                   |

## Internal tags: what information is helpful for maintainers or contributors?

These tags should be used only for development purposes; therefore please add them separately behind a version guard:

``` rst
.. ifconfig:: releaselevel == 'dev'
    .. tags::  internal: needs-review
```

| `tag`                        | use case                                                                                                 |
| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `internal: high-bandwidth`   | allows users to filter out bandwidth-intensive examples like animations                                  |
| `internal: untagged`         | allows docs contributors to easily find untagged examples                                                |
| `internal: deprecated`       | examples containing deprecated functionality or concepts                                                 |
| `internal: needs-review`     | example needs to be reviewed for accuracy or pedagogical value                                           |
| `internal: outstanding-todo` | example has an unfinished to-do                                                                          |
| `internal: too-much`         | the example should be refined, split into multiple examples, or reformatted into a tutorial or reference |

# Tagging guidelines

## Why do we need tags?

Tags serve multiple purposes.

Tags have a one-to-many organization (i.e. one example can have several tags), while the gallery structure requires that examples are placed in only one location. This means tags provide a secondary layer of organization and make the gallery of examples more flexible and more user-friendly.

They allow for better discoverability, search, and browse functionality. They are helpful for users struggling to write a search query for what they're looking for.

Hidden tags provide additional functionality for maintainers and contributors.

## How to tag?

Place the tag directive at the bottom of each page and add the tags underneath, e.g.:

`` `rst     .. tags::        topic: tagging, purpose: reference  What gets a tag? ``\` ----------------

Every gallery example should be tagged with:

  - 1+ content tags
  - structural, domain, or internal tag(s) if helpful

Tags can repeat existing forms of organization (e.g. an example is in the Animation folder and also gets an `animation` tag).

Tags are helpful to denote particularly good "byproduct" examples. E.g. the explicit purpose of a gallery example might be to demonstrate a colormap, but it's also a good demonstration of a legend. Tag `legend` to indicate that, rather than changing the title or the scope of the example.

<div class="card">

**Tag Categories** ^^^ .. rst-class:: section-toc

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

tag\_glossary

</div>

\+++ See \[Tag Glossary \<tag\_glossary\>\](Tag Glossary \<tag\_glossary\>.md) for a complete list

</div>

## Proposing new tags

1.  Review existing tag list, looking out for similar entries (i.e. `axes` and `axis`).
2.  If a relevant tag or subcategory does not yet exist, propose it. Each tag is two parts: `subcategory: tag`. Tags should be one or two words.
3.  New tags should be be added when they are relevant to existing gallery entries too. Avoid tags that will link to only a single gallery entry.
4.  Tags can recreate other forms of organization.

Tagging organization aims to work for 80-90% of cases. Some examples fall outside of the tagging structure. Niche or specific examples shouldn't be given standalone tags that won't apply to other examples.

# Testing

Matplotlib uses the [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/) framework.

The tests are in `lib/matplotlib/tests`, and customizations to the pytest testing infrastructure are in `matplotlib.testing`.

## Requirements

To run the tests you will need to \[set up Matplotlib for development \<installing\_for\_devs\>\](\#set-up-matplotlib-for-development-\<installing\_for\_devs\>). Note in particular the \[additional dependencies \<test-dependencies\>\](\#additional-dependencies-\<test-dependencies\>) for testing.

\> **Note** \> We will assume that you want to run the tests in a development setup.

> While you can run the tests against a regular installed version of Matplotlib, this is a far less common use case. You still need the \[additional dependencies \<test-dependencies\>\](\#additional-dependencies-\<test-dependencies\>) for testing. You have to additionally get the reference images from the repository, because they are not distributed with pre-built Matplotlib packages.

## Running the tests

In the root directory of your development repository run:

    pytest

`pytest` can be configured via many :external+pytest\[command-line parameters \<how-to/usage\>\](command-line parameters \<how-to/usage\>.md). Some particularly useful ones are:

|                        |                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-v` or `--verbose`    | Be more verbose                                                                                            |
| `-n NUM`               | Run tests in parallel over NUM processes (requires [pytest-xdist](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-xdist/)) |
| `--capture=no` or `-s` | Do not capture stdout                                                                                      |

To run a single test from the command line, you can provide a file path, optionally followed by the function separated by two colons, e.g., (tests do not need to be installed, but Matplotlib should be):

    pytest lib/matplotlib/tests/test_simplification.py::test_clipping

If you want to use `pytest` as a module (via `python -m pytest`), then you will need to avoid clashes between `pytest`'s import mode and Python's search path:

  - On more recent Python, you may :external+python:std`disable "unsafe import
    paths" <-P>` (i.e., stop adding the current directory to the import path) with the `-P` argument:
    
        python -P -m pytest

  - On older Python, you may enable :external+python:std`isolated mode <-I>` (which stops adding the current directory to the import path, but has other repercussions):
    
        python -I -m pytest

  - On any Python, set `pytest`'s :external+pytest\[import mode \<explanation/pythonpath\>\](import mode \<explanation/pythonpath\>.md) to the older `prepend` mode (but note that this will break `pytest`'s assert rewriting):
    
        python -m pytest --import-mode prepend

### Viewing image test output

The output of \[image-based \<image-comparison\>\](\#image-based-\<image-comparison\>) tests is stored in a `result_images` directory. These images can be compiled into one HTML page, containing hundreds of images, using the `visualize_tests` tool:

    python tools/visualize_tests.py

Image test failures can also be analysed using the `triage_tests` tool:

    python tools/triage_tests.py

The triage tool allows you to accept or reject test failures and will copy the new image to the folder where the baseline test images are stored. The triage tool requires that \[QT \<backend\_dependencies\>\](\#qt-\<backend\_dependencies\>) is installed.

## Writing a simple test

Many elements of Matplotlib can be tested using standard tests. For example, here is a test from `matplotlib/tests/test_basic.py`:

    def test_simple():
        """
        very simple example test
        """
        assert 1 + 1 == 2

Pytest determines which functions are tests by searching for files whose names begin with `"test_"` and then within those files for functions beginning with `"test"` or classes beginning with `"Test"`.

Some tests have internal side effects that need to be cleaned up after their execution (such as created figures or modified <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span>). The pytest fixture `matplotlib.testing.conftest.mpl_test_settings` will automatically clean these up; there is no need to do anything further.

## Random data in tests

Random data is a very convenient way to generate data for examples, however the randomness is problematic for testing (as the tests must be deterministic\!). To work around this set the seed in each test. For numpy's default random number generator use:

    import numpy as np
    rng = np.random.default_rng(19680801)

and then use `rng` when generating the random numbers.

The seed is \[John Hunter's \<project\_history\>\](\#john-hunter's-\<project\_history\>) birthday.

## Writing an image comparison test

Writing an image-based test is only slightly more difficult than a simple test. The main consideration is that you must specify the "baseline", or expected, images in the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.testing.decorators.image\_comparison</span> decorator. For example, this test generates a single image and automatically tests it:

    from matplotlib.testing.decorators import image_comparison
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    @image_comparison(baseline_images=['line_dashes'], remove_text=True,
                      extensions=['png'], style='mpl20')
    def test_line_dashes():
        fig, ax = plt.subplots()
        ax.plot(range(10), linestyle=(0, (3, 3)), lw=5)

The first time this test is run, there will be no baseline image to compare against, so the test will fail. Copy the output images (in this case `result_images/test_lines/test_line_dashes.png`) to the correct subdirectory of `baseline_images` tree in the source directory (in this case `lib/matplotlib/tests/baseline_images/test_lines`). Put this new file under source code revision control (with `git add`). When rerunning the tests, they should now pass.

It is preferred that new tests use `style='mpl20'` as this leads to smaller figures and reflects the newer look of default Matplotlib plots. Also, if the texts (labels, tick labels, etc) are not really part of what is tested, use `remove_text=True` as this will lead to smaller figures and reduce possible issues with font mismatch on different platforms.

### Compare two methods of creating an image

Baseline images take a lot of space in the Matplotlib repository. An alternative approach for image comparison tests is to use the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.testing.decorators.check\_figures\_equal</span> decorator, which should be used to decorate a function taking two <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> parameters and draws the same images on the figures using two different methods (the tested method and the baseline method). The decorator will arrange for setting up the figures and then collect the drawn results and compare them.

For example, this test compares two different methods to draw the same circle: plotting a circle using a <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patches.Circle</span> patch vs plotting the circle using the parametric equation of a circle :

    from matplotlib.testing.decorators import check_figures_equal
    import matplotlib.patches as mpatches
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    import numpy as np
    
    @check_figures_equal()
    def test_parametric_circle_plot(fig_test, fig_ref):
    
        xo, yo= (.5, .5)
        radius = 0.4
    
        ax_test = fig_test.subplots()
        theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, 150)
        l, = ax_test.plot(xo + (radius * np.cos(theta)),
                          yo + (radius * np.sin(theta)), c='r')
    
        ax_ref = fig_ref.subplots()
        red_circle_ref = mpatches.Circle((xo, yo), radius, ec='r', fc='none',
                                         lw=l.get_linewidth())
        ax_ref.add_artist(red_circle_ref)
    
        for ax in [ax_ref, ax_test]:
            ax.set(xlim=(0,1), ylim=(0,1), aspect='equal')

Both comparison decorators have a tolerance argument `tol` that is used to specify the tolerance for difference in color value between the two images, where 255 is the maximal difference. The test fails if the average pixel difference is greater than this value.

See the documentation of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.testing.decorators.image\_comparison</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.testing.decorators.check\_figures\_equal</span> for additional information about their use.

## Creating a new module in matplotlib.tests

We try to keep the tests categorized by the primary module they are testing. For example, the tests related to the `mathtext.py` module are in `test_mathtext.py`.

## Using GitHub Actions for CI

[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) is a hosted CI system "in the cloud".

GitHub Actions is configured to receive notifications of new commits to GitHub repos and to run builds or tests when it sees these new commits. It looks for a YAML files in `.github/workflows` to see how to test the project.

GitHub Actions is already enabled for the [main Matplotlib GitHub repository](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/) -- for example, see [the Tests workflows](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/actions?query=workflow%3ATests).

GitHub Actions should be automatically enabled for your personal Matplotlib fork once the YAML workflow files are in it. It generally isn't necessary to look at these workflows, since any pull request submitted against the main Matplotlib repository will be tested. The Tests workflow is skipped in forked repositories but you can trigger a run manually from the [GitHub web interface](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow).

You can see the GitHub Actions results at <https://github.com/your_GitHub_user_name/matplotlib/actions> -- here's [an example](https://github.com/QuLogic/matplotlib/actions).

## Using tox

[Tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is a tool for running tests against multiple Python environments, including multiple versions of Python (e.g., 3.10, 3.11) and even different Python implementations altogether (e.g., CPython, PyPy, Jython, etc.), as long as all these versions are available on your system's $PATH (consider using your system package manager, e.g. apt-get, yum, or Homebrew, to install them).

tox makes it easy to determine if your working copy introduced any regressions before submitting a pull request. Here's how to use it:

`` `bash     $ pip install tox     $ tox  You can also run tox on a subset of environments:  .. code-block:: bash      $ tox -e py310,py311  Tox processes everything serially so it can take a long time to test ``<span class="title-ref"> several environments. To speed it up, you might try using a new, parallelized version of tox called </span><span class="title-ref">detox</span>\`. Give this a try:

`` `bash     $ pip install -U -i http://pypi.testrun.org detox     $ detox  Tox is configured using a file called ``tox.ini`. You may need to`<span class="title-ref"> edit this file if you want to add new environments to test (e.g., </span><span class="title-ref">py33</span><span class="title-ref">) or if you want to tweak the dependencies or the way the tests are run. For more info on the </span><span class="title-ref">tox.ini</span><span class="title-ref"> file, see the \`Tox Configuration Specification \<https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html\></span>\_.

## Building old versions of Matplotlib

When running a `git bisect` to see which commit introduced a certain bug, you may (rarely) need to build very old versions of Matplotlib. The following constraints need to be taken into account:

  - Matplotlib 1.3 (or earlier) requires numpy 1.8 (or earlier).

## Testing released versions of Matplotlib

Running the tests on an installation of a released version (e.g. PyPI package or conda package) also requires additional setup.

\> **Note** \> For an end-user, there is usually no need to run the tests on released versions of Matplotlib. Official releases are tested before publishing.

### Install additional dependencies

Install the \[additional dependencies for testing \<test-dependencies\>\](\#additional-dependencies-for-testing-\<test-dependencies\>).

### Obtain the reference images

Many tests compare the plot result against reference images. The reference images are not part of the regular packaged versions (pip wheels or conda packages). If you want to run tests with reference images, you need to obtain the reference images matching the version of Matplotlib you want to test.

To do so, either download the matching source distribution `matplotlib-X.Y.Z.tar.gz` from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/) or alternatively, clone the git repository and `git checkout vX.Y.Z`. Copy the folder `lib/matplotlib/tests/baseline_images` to the folder `matplotlib/tests` of your the matplotlib installation to test. The correct target folder can be found using:

    python -c "import matplotlib.tests; print(matplotlib.tests.__file__.rsplit('/', 1)[0])"

An analogous copying of `lib/mpl_toolkits/*/tests/baseline_images` is necessary for testing `mpl_toolkits`.

### Run the tests

To run all the tests on your installed version of Matplotlib:

    pytest --pyargs matplotlib.tests

The test discovery scope can be narrowed to single test modules or even single functions:

    pytest --pyargs matplotlib.tests.test_simplification.py::test_clipping

# Bug triaging and issue curation

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues) is important to communication in the project because it serves as the centralized location for making feature requests, reporting bugs, identifying major projects to work on, and discussing priorities. For this reason, it is important to curate the issue list, adding labels to issues and closing issues that are resolved or unresolvable.

Writing well defined issues increases their chances of being successfully resolved. Guidelines on writing a good issue can be found in \[here \<submitting-a-bug-report\>\](\#here \<submitting-a-bug-report\>). The recommendations in this page are adapted from the [scikit learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/developers/bug_triaging.html) and [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/development/maintaining.html) contributing guides.

## Improve issue reports

Triaging issues does not require any particular expertise in the internals of Matplotlib, is extremely valuable to the project, and we welcome anyone to participate in issue triage\! However, people who are not part of the Matplotlib organization do not have [permissions to change milestones, add labels, or close issue](https://docs.github.com/en/organizations/managing-access-to-your-organizations-repositories/repository-permission-levels-for-an-organization).

If you do not have enough GitHub permissions do something (e.g. add a label, close an issue), please leave a comment with your recommendations\!

The following actions are typically useful:

  - documenting issues that are missing elements to reproduce the problem such as code samples
  - suggesting better use of code formatting (e.g. triple back ticks in the markdown).
  - suggesting to reformulate the title and description to make them more explicit about the problem to be solved
  - linking to related issues or discussions while briefly describing how they are related, for instance "See also \#xyz for a similar attempt at this" or "See also \#xyz where the same thing was reported" provides context and helps the discussion
  - verifying that the issue is reproducible
  - classify the issue as a feature request, a long standing bug or a regression

<div class="topic">

**Fruitful discussions**

Online discussions may be harder than it seems at first glance, in particular given that a person new to open-source may have a very different understanding of the process than a seasoned maintainer.

Overall, it is useful to stay positive and assume good will. [The following article](http://gael-varoquaux.info/programming/technical-discussions-are-hard-a-few-tips.html) explores how to lead online discussions in the context of open source.

</div>

### Maintainers and triage team members

In addition to the above, maintainers and the triage team can do the following important tasks:

  - Update labels for issues and PRs: see the list of [available GitHub labels](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/labels).
  - Triage issues:
      - **reproduce the issue**, if the posted code is a bug label the issue with "status: confirmed bug".
      - **identify regressions**, determine if the reported bug used to work as expected in a recent version of Matplotlib and if so determine the last working version. Regressions should be milestoned for the next bug-fix release and may be labeled as "Release critical".
      - **close usage questions** and politely point the reporter to use [discourse](https://discourse.matplotlib.org) or Stack Overflow instead and label as "community support".
      - **close duplicate issues**, after checking that they are indeed duplicate. Ideally, the original submitter moves the discussion to the older, duplicate issue
      - **close issues that cannot be replicated**, after leaving time (at least a week) to add extra information

<div class="topic">

**Closing issues: a tough call**

When uncertain on whether an issue should be closed or not, it is best to strive for consensus with the original poster, and possibly to seek relevant expertise. However, when the issue is a usage question or has been considered as unclear for many years, then it should be closed.

</div>

## Preparing PRs for review

Reviewing code is also encouraged. Contributors and users are welcome to participate to the review process following our \[review guidelines \<pr-guidelines\>\](\#review-guidelines \<pr-guidelines\>).

## Triage workflow

The following workflow is a good way to approach issue triaging:

1.  Thank the reporter for opening an issue
    
    The issue tracker is many people’s first interaction with the Matplotlib project itself, beyond just using the library. As such, we want it to be a welcoming, pleasant experience.

2.  Is this a usage question? If so close it with a polite message.

3.  Is the necessary information provided?
    
    Check that the poster has filled in the issue template. If crucial information (the version of Python, the version of Matplotlib used, the OS, and the backend), is missing politely ask the original poster to provide the information.

4.  Is the issue minimal and reproducible?
    
    For bug reports, we ask that the reporter provide a minimal reproducible example. See [this useful post](https://matthewrocklin.com/blog/work/2018/02/28/minimal-bug-reports) by Matthew Rocklin for a good explanation. If the example is not reproducible, or if it's clearly not minimal, feel free to ask the reporter if they can provide an example or simplify the provided one. Do acknowledge that writing minimal reproducible examples is hard work. If the reporter is struggling, you can try to write one yourself.
    
    If a reproducible example is provided, but you see a simplification, add your simpler reproducible example.
    
    If you cannot reproduce the issue, please report that along with your OS, Python, and Matplotlib versions.
    
    If we need more information from either this or the previous step please label the issue with "status: needs clarification".

5.  Is this a regression?
    
    While we strive for a bug-free library, regressions are the highest priority. If we have broken user-code that *used to* work, we should fix that in the next micro release\!
    
    Try to determine when the regression happened by running the reproduction code against older versions of Matplotlib. This can be done by released versions of Matplotlib (to get the version it last worked in) or by using [git bisect](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-bisect) to find the first commit where it was broken.

6.  Is this a duplicate issue?
    
    We have many open issues. If a new issue seems to be a duplicate, point to the original issue. If it is a clear duplicate, or consensus is that it is redundant, close it. Make sure to still thank the reporter, and encourage them to chime in on the original issue, and perhaps try to fix it.
    
    If the new issue provides relevant information, such as a better or slightly different example, add it to the original issue as a comment or an edit to the original post.
    
    Label the closed issue with "status: duplicate"

7.  Make sure that the title accurately reflects the issue. If you have the necessary permissions edit it yourself if it's not clear.

8.  Add the relevant labels, such as "Documentation" when the issue is about documentation, "Bug" if it is clearly a bug, "New feature" if it is a new feature request, ...
    
    If the issue is clearly defined and the fix seems relatively straightforward, label the issue as “Good first issue” (and possibly a description of the fix or a hint as to where in the code base to look to get started).
    
    An additional useful step can be to tag the corresponding module e.g. the "GUI/Qt" label when relevant.

## Triage team

If you would like to join the triage team:

1.  Correctly triage 2-3 issues.
2.  Ask someone on in the Matplotlib organization (publicly or privately) to recommend you to the triage team (look for "Member" on the top-right of comments on GitHub). If you worked with someone on the issues triaged, they would be a good person to ask.
3.  Responsibly exercise your new power\!

Anyone with commit or triage rights may nominate a user to be invited to join the triage team by emailing <matplotlib-steering-council@numfocus.org> .

# Troubleshooting

For guidance on debugging an installation, see \[installing-faq\](\#installing-faq).

## Problems with git

First, make sure you have a clean build and install (see \[clean-install\](\#clean-install)), get the latest git update, install it and run a simple test script in debug mode:

    rm -rf /path/to/site-packages/matplotlib*
    git clean -xfd
    git pull
    python -m pip install -v . > build.out
    python -c "from pylab import *; set_loglevel('debug'); plot(); show()" > run.out

and post `build.out` and `run.out` to the [matplotlib-devel](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-devel) mailing list (please do not post git problems to the [users list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users)).

Of course, you will want to clearly describe your problem, what you are expecting and what you are getting, but often a clean build and install will help. See also \[reporting-problems\](\#reporting-problems).

## Unlink of file `*/_c_internal_utils.cp311-win_amd64.pyd` failed

The DLL files may be loaded by multiple running instances of Matplotlib; therefore check that Matplotlib is not running in any other application before trying to unlink this file. Multiple versions of Matplotlib can be linked to the same DLL, for example a development version installed in a development conda environment and a stable version running in a Jupyter notebook. To resolve this error, fully close all running instances of Matplotlib.

## Windows compilation errors

If the compiled extensions are not building on Windows due to errors in linking to Windows' header files, for example `../../src/_tkagg.cpp:133:10: error: 'WM_DPICHANGED' was not declared in this scope`, you should check which compiler Meson is using:

`` `bat     Build type: native build     Project name: matplotlib     Project version: 3.9.0.dev0     C compiler for the host machine: cc (gcc 7.2.0 "cc (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 7.2.0")     C linker for the host machine: cc ld.bfd 2.29.1     C++ compiler for the host machine: c++ (gcc 7.2.0 "c++ (Rev1, Built by MSYS2 project) 7.2.0")     C++ linker for the host machine: c++ ld.bfd 2.29.1  Our [dependencies <dependencies>](#dependencies-<dependencies>) documentation lists the minimum header ``<span class="title-ref"> version if you intended to use </span><span class="title-ref">MSYS2</span><span class="title-ref">. If you intended to use </span><span class="title-ref">MSVC</span>\` then you may need to force Meson to :external+meson-python\[use MSVC \<vsenv-example\>\](\#use-msvc-\<vsenv-example\>).

# Dependencies

## Runtime dependencies

### Required

When installing through a package manager like `pip` or `conda`, the mandatory dependencies are automatically installed. This list is mainly for reference.

  - [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (\>= 3.10)
  - [contourpy](https://pypi.org/project/contourpy/) (\>= 1.0.1)
  - [cycler](https://matplotlib.org/cycler/) (\>= 0.10.0)
  - [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/) (\>= 2.7)
  - [fontTools](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 4.22.0)
  - [kiwisolver](https://github.com/nucleic/kiwi) (\>= 1.3.1)
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org) (\>= 1.23)
  - [packaging](https://pypi.org/project/packaging/) (\>= 20.0)
  - [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 8.0)
  - [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) (\>= 2.3.1)

### Optional

The following packages and tools are not required but extend the capabilities of Matplotlib.

#### Backends

Matplotlib figures can be rendered to various user interfaces. See \[what-is-a-backend\](\#what-is-a-backend) for more details on the optional Matplotlib backends and the capabilities they provide.

  - [Tk](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html) (\>= 8.5, \!= 8.6.0 or 8.6.1): for the Tk-based backends. Tk is part of most standard Python installations, but it's not part of Python itself and thus may not be present in rare cases.
  - [PyQt6](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt6/) (\>= 6.1), [PySide6](https://pypi.org/project/PySide6/), [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/) (\>= 5.12), or [PySide2](https://pypi.org/project/PySide2/): for the Qt-based backends.
  - [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [pycairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 1.14.0): for the GTK-based backends. If using pip (but not conda or system package manager) PyGObject must be built from source; see [pygobject documentation](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/devguide/dev_environ.html).
  - [pycairo](https://pycairo.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) (\>= 1.14.0) or [cairocffi](https://doc.courtbouillon.org/cairocffi/stable/) (\>= 0.8): for cairo-based backends.
  - [wxPython](https://www.wxpython.org/) (\>= 4): for the wx-based backends. If using pip (but not conda or system package manager) on Linux wxPython wheels must be manually downloaded from <https://wxpython.org/pages/downloads/>.
  - [Tornado](https://pypi.org/project/tornado/) (\>= 5): for the WebAgg backend.
  - [ipykernel](https://pypi.org/project/ipykernel/): for the nbagg backend.
  - macOS (\>= 10.12): for the macosx backend.

#### Animations

  - [ffmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/): for saving movies.
  - [ImageMagick](https://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php): for saving animated gifs.

#### Font handling and rendering

  - [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) (with [cm-super](https://ctan.org/pkg/cm-super) and [underscore](https://ctan.org/pkg/underscore)) and [GhostScript (\>= 9.0)](https://ghostscript.com/releases/): for rendering text with LaTeX.
  - [fontconfig](https://www.fontconfig.org) (\>= 2.7): for detection of system fonts on Linux.

### C libraries

Matplotlib brings its own copies of the following libraries:

  - `Agg`: the Anti-Grain Geometry C++ rendering engine
  - `ttconv`: a TrueType font utility

Additionally, Matplotlib depends on:

  - [FreeType](https://www.freetype.org/) (\>= 2.3): a font rendering library
  - [QHull](http://www.qhull.org/) (\>= 8.0.2): a library for computing triangulations (note that this version is also known as 2020.2)

#### Download during install

By default, Matplotlib downloads and builds its own copies of Qhull and FreeType. The vendored version of FreeType is necessary to run the test suite, because different versions of FreeType rasterize characters differently.

#### Use system libraries

To force Matplotlib to use a copy of FreeType or Qhull already installed in your system, you must [pass configuration settings to Meson via meson-python](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/en/stable/how-to-guides/config-settings.html):

`` `sh    python -m pip install \      --config-settings=setup-args="-Dsystem-freetype=true" \      --config-settings=setup-args="-Dsystem-qhull=true" \      .   In this case, you need to install the FreeType and Qhull library and headers. ``\` This can be achieved using a package manager, e.g. for FreeType:

`` `sh    # Pick ONE of the following:    sudo apt install libfreetype6-dev  # Debian/Ubuntu    sudo dnf install freetype-devel    # Fedora    brew install freetype              # macOS with Homebrew    conda install freetype             # conda, any OS  (adapt accordingly for Qhull).  On Linux and macOS, it is also recommended to install pkg-config_, a helper ``\` tool for locating FreeType:

`` `sh    # Pick ONE of the following:    sudo apt install pkg-config  # Debian/Ubuntu    sudo dnf install pkgconf     # Fedora    brew install pkg-config      # macOS with Homebrew    conda install pkg-config     # conda    # Or point the PKG_CONFIG environment variable to the path to pkg-config:    export PKG_CONFIG=...    If not using pkg-config (in particular on Windows), you may need to set the ``\` include path (to the library headers) and link path (to the libraries) explicitly, if they are not in standard locations. This can be done using standard environment variables -- on Linux and macOS:

`` `sh    export CFLAGS='-I/directory/containing/ft2build.h'    export LDFLAGS='-L/directory/containing/libfreetype.so'  and on Windows:  .. code-block:: bat     set CL=/IC:\directory\containing\ft2build.h    set LINK=/LIBPATH:C:\directory\containing\freetype.lib  If you go this route but need to reset and rebuild to change your settings, ``\` remember to clear your artifacts before re-building:

    git clean -xfd

#### From source files

If the automatic download does not work (for example, on air-gapped systems) it is preferable to instead use system libraries. However you can manually download the tarballs into `subprojects/packagecache` at the top level of the checkout repository. The expected SHA256 hashes of the downloaded tarballs are in `subprojects/*.wrap` if you wish to verify them, but they will also be checked by the build system before unpacking.

### Minimum pip / manylinux support (linux)

Matplotlib publishes [manylinux wheels](https://github.com/pypa/manylinux) which have a minimum version of pip which will recognize the wheels

  - Python 3.9+: `manylinux2014` / pip \>= 19.3

In all cases the required version of pip is embedded in the CPython source.

## Build dependencies

### Python

`pip` normally builds packages using :external+pip\[build isolation \<reference/build-system/pyproject-toml\>\](build isolation \<reference/build-system/pyproject-toml\>.md), which means that `pip` installs the dependencies listed here for the duration of the build process. However, build isolation is disabled via the the :external+pip\[--no-build-isolation \<[install]()--no-build-isolation\>\](\#--no-build-isolation-\<[install]()--no-build-isolation\>) flag when \[installing Matplotlib for development \<development-install\>\](\#installing-matplotlib-for-development-\<development-install\>), which means that the dependencies must be explicitly installed, either by \[creating a virtual environment \<dev-environment\>\](\#creating-a-virtual-environment-\<dev-environment\>) (recommended) or by manually installing the following packages:

  - [meson-python](https://meson-python.readthedocs.io/) (\>= 0.13.1).
  - [ninja](https://ninja-build.org/) (\>= 1.8.2). This may be available in your package manager or bundled with Meson, but may be installed via `pip` if otherwise not available.
  - [PyBind11](https://pypi.org/project/pybind11/) (\>= 2.13.2). Used to connect C/C++ code with Python.
  - [setuptools\_scm](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools-scm/) (\>= 7). Used to update the reported `mpl.__version__` based on the current git commit. Also a runtime dependency for editable installs.
  - [NumPy](https://numpy.org) (\>= 1.22). Also a runtime dependency.

### Compiled extensions

Matplotlib requires a C++ compiler that supports C++17, and each platform has a development environment that must be installed before a compiler can be installed. You may also need to install headers for various libraries used in the compiled extension source files.

If any of these dependencies are not discovered, then the tests that rely on them will be skipped by pytest.

\> **Note** \> When installing Inkscape on Windows, make sure that you select “Add Inkscape to system PATH”, either for all users or current user, or the tests will not find it.

## Documentation dependencies

### Python

The additional Python packages required to build the \[documentation \<documenting-matplotlib\>\](\#documentation-\<documenting-matplotlib\>) are listed in `doc-requirements.txt` and can be installed using :

    pip install -r requirements/doc/doc-requirements.txt

The content of `doc-requirements.txt` is also shown below:

\# Requirements for building docs \# \# You will first need a matching Matplotlib installation \# e.g (from the Matplotlib root directory) \# pip install --no-build-isolation --editable .\[dev\] \# \# Install the documentation requirements with: \# pip install -r requirements/doc/doc-requirements.txt \# sphinx\>=5.1.0,\!=6.1.2 colorspacious ipython ipywidgets ipykernel numpydoc\>=1.0 packaging\>=20 pydata-sphinx-theme\~=0.15.0 mpl-sphinx-theme\~=3.9.0 pyyaml PyStemmer sphinxcontrib-svg2pdfconverter\>=1.1.0 sphinxcontrib-video\>=0.2.1 sphinx-copybutton sphinx-design sphinx-gallery\[parallel\]\>=0.12.0 sphinx-tags\>=0.4.0

# Environment variables

<div class="envvar">

HOME

The user's home directory. On Linux, `~ <HOME>` is shorthand for `HOME`.

</div>

<div class="envvar">

MPLBACKEND

This optional variable can be set to choose the Matplotlib backend. See \[what-is-a-backend\](\#what-is-a-backend).

</div>

<div class="envvar">

MPLCONFIGDIR

This is the directory used to store user customizations to Matplotlib, as well as some caches to improve performance. If `MPLCONFIGDIR` is not defined, `{HOME}/.config/matplotlib` and `{HOME}/.cache/matplotlib` are used on Linux, and `{HOME}/.matplotlib` on other platforms, if they are writable. Otherwise, the Python standard library's <span class="title-ref">tempfile.gettempdir</span> is used to find a base directory in which the `matplotlib` subdirectory is created.

</div>

<div class="envvar">

PATH

The list of directories searched to find executable programs.

</div>

<div class="envvar">

PYTHONPATH

The list of directories that are added to Python's standard search list when importing packages and modules.

</div>

<div class="envvar">

QT\_API

The Python Qt wrapper to prefer when using Qt-based backends. See \[the entry in the usage guide \<QT\_bindings\>\](\#the

</div>

\---entry-in-the-usage-guide-\<qt\_bindings\>) for more information.

## Setting environment variables in Linux and macOS

To list the current value of `PYTHONPATH`, which may be empty, try:

    echo $PYTHONPATH

The procedure for setting environment variables in depends on what your default shell is. Common shells include `bash` and `csh`. You should be able to determine which by running at the command prompt:

    echo $SHELL

To create a new environment variable:

    export PYTHONPATH=~/Python  # bash/ksh
    setenv PYTHONPATH ~/Python  # csh/tcsh

To prepend to an existing environment variable:

    export PATH=~/bin:${PATH}  # bash/ksh
    setenv PATH ~/bin:${PATH}  # csh/tcsh

The search order may be important to you, do you want `~/bin` to be searched first or last? To append to an existing environment variable:

    export PATH=${PATH}:~/bin  # bash/ksh
    setenv PATH ${PATH}:~/bin  # csh/tcsh

To make your changes available in the future, add the commands to your `~/.bashrc` or `~/.cshrc` file.

## Setting environment variables in Windows

Open the `Control Panel` (`Start --> Control Panel`), start the `System` program. Click the `Advanced` tab and select the `Environment Variables` button. You can edit or add to the `User Variables`.

# Installation

## Install an official release

Matplotlib releases are available as wheel packages for macOS, Windows and Linux on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/). Install it using `pip`:

`` `sh   python -m pip install -U pip   python -m pip install -U matplotlib  If this command results in Matplotlib being compiled from source and ``<span class="title-ref"> there's trouble with the compilation, you can add </span><span class="title-ref">--prefer-binary</span>\` to select the newest version of Matplotlib for which there is a precompiled wheel for your OS and Python.

\> **Note** \> The following backends work out of the box: Agg, ps, pdf, svg

> Python is typically shipped with tk bindings which are used by TkAgg.
> 
> For support of other GUI frameworks, LaTeX rendering, saving animations and a larger selection of file formats, you can install \[optional dependencies \<optional\_dependencies\>\](\#optional-dependencies-\<optional\_dependencies\>).

## Third-party distributions

Various third-parties provide Matplotlib for their environments.

### Conda packages

Matplotlib is available both via the *anaconda main channel*

`` `sh    conda install matplotlib  as well as via the *conda-forge community channel*  .. code-block:: sh     conda install -c conda-forge matplotlib  Python distributions ``\` --------------------

Matplotlib is part of major Python distributions:

  - [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)
  - [ActiveState ActivePython](https://www.activestate.com/products/python/downloads/)
  - [WinPython](https://winpython.github.io/)

### Linux package manager

If you are using the Python version that comes with your Linux distribution, you can install Matplotlib via your package manager, e.g.:

  - Debian / Ubuntu: `sudo apt-get install python3-matplotlib`
  - Fedora: `sudo dnf install python3-matplotlib`
  - Red Hat: `sudo yum install python3-matplotlib`
  - Arch: `sudo pacman -S python-matplotlib`

<div class="redirect-from">

/users/installing/installing\_source

</div>

## Install a nightly build

Matplotlib makes nightly development build wheels available on the [scientific-python-nightly-wheels Anaconda Cloud organization](https://anaconda.org/scientific-python-nightly-wheels). These wheels can be installed with `pip` by specifying scientific-python-nightly-wheels as the package index to query:

`` `sh   python -m pip install \     --upgrade \     --pre \     --index-url https://pypi.anaconda.org/scientific-python-nightly-wheels/simple \     --extra-index-url https://pypi.org/simple \     matplotlib   Install from source ``\` ===================

<div class="admonition important">

Installing for Development

If you would like to contribute to Matplotlib or otherwise need to install the latest development code, please follow the instructions in \[installing\_for\_devs\](\#installing\_for\_devs).

</div>

The following instructions are for installing from source for production use. This is generally *not* recommended; please use prebuilt packages when possible. Proceed with caution because these instructions may result in your build producing unexpected behavior and/or causing local testing to fail.

Before trying to install Matplotlib, please install the \[dependencies\](\#dependencies).

To build from a tarball, download the latest *tar.gz* release file from [the PyPI files page](https://pypi.org/project/matplotlib/).

If you are building your own Matplotlib wheels (or sdists) on Windows, note that any DLLs that you copy into the source tree will be packaged too.

## Configure build and behavior defaults

We provide a [meson.options](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/blob/main/meson.options) file containing options with which you can use to customize the build process. For example, which default backend to use, whether some of the optional libraries that Matplotlib ships with are installed, and so on. These options will be particularly useful to those packaging Matplotlib.

Aspects of some behaviorial defaults of the library can be configured via:

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

environment\_variables\_faq.rst

</div>

Default plotting appearance and behavior can be configured via the \[rcParams file \<customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\>\](\#rcparams-file-\<customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\>)

## Dependencies

Mandatory dependencies should be installed automatically if you install Matplotlib using a package manager such as `pip` or `conda`; therefore this list is primarily for reference and troubleshooting.

</div>

## Frequently asked questions

### Report a compilation problem

See \[reporting-problems\](\#reporting-problems).

### Matplotlib compiled fine, but nothing shows up when I use it

The first thing to try is a \[clean install \<clean-install\>\](\#clean-install-\<clean-install\>) and see if that helps. If not, the best way to test your install is by running a script, rather than working interactively from a python shell or an integrated development environment such as `IDLE` which add additional complexities. Open up a UNIX shell or a DOS command prompt and run, for example:

    python -c "from pylab import *; set_loglevel('debug'); plot(); show()"

This will give you additional information about which backends Matplotlib is loading, version information, and more. At this point you might want to make sure you understand Matplotlib's \[configuration \<customizing\>\](\#configuration-\<customizing\>) process, governed by the `matplotlibrc` configuration file which contains instructions within and the concept of the Matplotlib backend.

If you are still having trouble, see \[reporting-problems\](\#reporting-problems).

### How to completely remove Matplotlib

Occasionally, problems with Matplotlib can be solved with a clean installation of the package. In order to fully remove an installed Matplotlib:

  - 1\. Delete the caches from your \[Matplotlib configuration directory  
    \<locating-matplotlib-config-dir\>\](\#matplotlib-configuration-directory

\---\<locating-matplotlib-config-dir\>).

  - 2\. Delete any Matplotlib directories or eggs from your \[installation  
    directory \<locating-matplotlib-install\>\](\#installation

\---directory-\<locating-matplotlib-install\>).

### macOS Notes

#### Which python for macOS?

Apple ships macOS with its own Python, in `/usr/bin/python`, and its own copy of Matplotlib. Unfortunately, the way Apple currently installs its own copies of NumPy, Scipy and Matplotlib means that these packages are difficult to upgrade (see [system python packages](https://github.com/MacPython/wiki/wiki/Which-Python#system-python-and-extra-python-packages)). For that reason we strongly suggest that you install a fresh version of Python and use that as the basis for installing libraries such as NumPy and Matplotlib. One convenient way to install Matplotlib with other useful Python software is to use the [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) Python scientific software collection, which includes Python itself and a wide range of libraries; if you need a library that is not available from the collection, you can install it yourself using standard methods such as *pip*. See the Anaconda web page for installation support.

Other options for a fresh Python install are the standard installer from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/), or installing Python using a general macOS package management system such as [homebrew](https://brew.sh/) or [macports](https://www.macports.org). Power users on macOS will likely want one of homebrew or macports on their system to install open source software packages, but it is perfectly possible to use these systems with another source for your Python binary, such as Anaconda or Python.org Python.

#### Installing macOS binary wheels

If you are using Python from <https://www.python.org>, Homebrew, or Macports, then you can use the standard pip installer to install Matplotlib binaries in the form of wheels.

pip is installed by default with python.org and Homebrew Python, but needs to be manually installed on Macports with :

    sudo port install py38-pip

Once pip is installed, you can install Matplotlib and all its dependencies with from the Terminal.app command line:

    python3 -m pip install matplotlib

You might also want to install IPython or the Jupyter notebook (`python3 -m pip install ipython notebook`).

#### Checking your installation

The new version of Matplotlib should now be on your Python "path". Check this at the Terminal.app command line:

    python3 -c 'import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__, matplotlib.__file__)'

You should see something like :

    3.10.0 /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.10/lib/python3.10/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.py

where `3.10.0` is the Matplotlib version you just installed, and the path following depends on whether you are using Python.org Python, Homebrew or Macports. If you see another version, or you get an error like :

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
    ImportError: No module named matplotlib

then check that the Python binary is the one you expected by running :

    which python3

If you get a result like `/usr/bin/python...`, then you are getting the Python installed with macOS, which is probably not what you want. Try closing and restarting Terminal.app before running the check again. If that doesn't fix the problem, depending on which Python you wanted to use, consider reinstalling Python.org Python, or check your homebrew or macports setup. Remember that the disk image installer only works for Python.org Python, and will not get picked up by other Pythons. If all these fail, please \[let us know \<reporting-problems\>\](\#let-us-know \<reporting-problems\>).

## Troubleshooting

### Obtaining Matplotlib version

To find out your Matplotlib version number, import it and print the `__version__` attribute:

    >>> import matplotlib
    >>> matplotlib.__version__
    '0.98.0'

### `matplotlib` install location

You can find what directory Matplotlib is installed in by importing it and printing the `__file__` attribute:

    >>> import matplotlib
    >>> matplotlib.__file__
    '/home/jdhunter/dev/lib64/python2.5/site-packages/matplotlib/__init__.pyc'

### `matplotlib` configuration and cache directory locations

Each user has a Matplotlib configuration directory which may contain a \[matplotlibrc \<customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\>\](\#matplotlibrc-\<customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files\>) file. To locate your `matplotlib/` configuration directory, use \`matplotlib.get\_configdir\`:

    >>> import matplotlib as mpl
    >>> mpl.get_configdir()
    '/home/darren/.config/matplotlib'

On Unix-like systems, this directory is generally located in your `HOME` directory under the `.config/` directory.

In addition, users have a cache directory. On Unix-like systems, this is separate from the configuration directory by default. To locate your `.cache/` directory, use \`matplotlib.get\_cachedir\`:

    >>> import matplotlib as mpl
    >>> mpl.get_cachedir()
    '/home/darren/.cache/matplotlib'

On Windows, both the config directory and the cache directory are the same and are in your `Documents and Settings` or `Users` directory by default:

    >>> import matplotlib as mpl
    >>> mpl.get_configdir()
    'C:\\Documents and Settings\\jdhunter\\.matplotlib'
    >>> mpl.get_cachedir()
    'C:\\Documents and Settings\\jdhunter\\.matplotlib'

If you would like to use a different configuration directory, you can do so by specifying the location in your `MPLCONFIGDIR` environment variable -- see \[setting-linux-macos-environment-variables\](\#setting-linux-macos-environment-variables). Note that `MPLCONFIGDIR` sets the location of both the configuration directory and the cache directory.

| Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct |
| ------------------------------------ |
|                                      |
| Our Pledge                           |

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

# Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

  - Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
  - Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
  - Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
  - Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
  - Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

  - The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
  - Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
  - Public or private harassment
  - Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
  - Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

# Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

# Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

# Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at <matplotlib-coc@numfocus.org> which is monitored by the [CoC subcommittee](https://matplotlib.org/governance/people.html#coc-subcommittee) or a report can be made using the [NumFOCUS Code of Conduct report form](https://numfocus.typeform.com/to/ynjGdT). If community leaders cannot come to a resolution about enforcement, reports will be escalated to the NumFocus Code of Conduct committee (<conduct@numfocus.org>). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

# Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

## 1\. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

## 2\. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

## 3\. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

## 4\. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

# Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org), version 2.0, available at <https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct.html>.

Community Impact Guidelines were inspired by [Mozilla's code of conduct enforcement ladder](https://github.com/mozilla/diversity).

# History

\> **Note** \> The following introductory text was written in 2008 by John D. Hunter (1968-2012), the original author of Matplotlib.

Matplotlib is a library for making 2D plots of arrays in [Python](https://www.python.org). Although it has its origins in emulating the MATLAB graphics commands, it is independent of MATLAB, and can be used in a Pythonic, object-oriented way. Although Matplotlib is written primarily in pure Python, it makes heavy use of [NumPy](https://numpy.org) and other extension code to provide good performance even for large arrays.

Matplotlib is designed with the philosophy that you should be able to create simple plots with just a few commands, or just one\! If you want to see a histogram of your data, you shouldn't need to instantiate objects, call methods, set properties, and so on; it should just work.

For years, I used to use MATLAB exclusively for data analysis and visualization. MATLAB excels at making nice looking plots easy. When I began working with EEG data, I found that I needed to write applications to interact with my data, and developed an EEG analysis application in MATLAB. As the application grew in complexity, interacting with databases, http servers, manipulating complex data structures, I began to strain against the limitations of MATLAB as a programming language, and decided to start over in Python. Python more than makes up for all of MATLAB's deficiencies as a programming language, but I was having difficulty finding a 2D plotting package (for 3D [VTK](http://www.vtk.org/) more than exceeds all of my needs).

When I went searching for a Python plotting package, I had several requirements:

  - Plots should look great - publication quality. One important requirement for me is that the text looks good (antialiased, etc.)
  - Postscript output for inclusion with TeX documents
  - Embeddable in a graphical user interface for application development
  - Code should be easy enough that I can understand it and extend it
  - Making plots should be easy

Finding no package that suited me just right, I did what any self-respecting Python programmer would do: rolled up my sleeves and dived in. Not having any real experience with computer graphics, I decided to emulate MATLAB's plotting capabilities because that is something MATLAB does very well. This had the added advantage that many people have a lot of MATLAB experience, and thus they can quickly get up to steam plotting in python. From a developer's perspective, having a fixed user interface (the pylab interface) has been very useful, because the guts of the code base can be redesigned without affecting user code.

The Matplotlib code is conceptually divided into three parts: the *pylab interface* is the set of functions provided by `pylab` which allow the user to create plots with code quite similar to MATLAB figure generating code (\[pyplot\_tutorial\](\#pyplot\_tutorial)). The *Matplotlib frontend* or *Matplotlib API* is the set of classes that do the heavy lifting, creating and managing figures, text, lines, plots and so on (\[artists\_tutorial\](\#artists\_tutorial)). This is an abstract interface that knows nothing about output. The *backends* are device-dependent drawing devices, aka renderers, that transform the frontend representation to hardcopy or a display device (\[what-is-a-backend\](\#what-is-a-backend)). Example backends: PS creates [PostScript®](https://www.adobe.com/products/postscript.html) hardcopy, SVG creates [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/) hardcopy, Agg creates PNG output using the high quality [Anti-Grain Geometry](http://agg.sourceforge.net/antigrain.com/) library that ships with Matplotlib, GTK embeds Matplotlib in a [Gtk+](https://www.gtk.org/) application, GTKAgg uses the Anti-Grain renderer to create a figure and embed it in a Gtk+ application, and so on for [PDF](https://acrobat.adobe.com/us/en/acrobat/about-adobe-pdf.html), [WxWidgets](https://www.wxpython.org/), [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html), etc.

Matplotlib is used by many people in many different contexts. Some people want to automatically generate PostScript files to send to a printer or publishers. Others deploy Matplotlib on a web application server to generate PNG output for inclusion in dynamically-generated web pages. Some use Matplotlib interactively from the Python shell in Tkinter on Windows. My primary use is to embed Matplotlib in a Gtk+ EEG application that runs on Windows, Linux and Macintosh OS X.

## Copyright policy

John Hunter began Matplotlib around 2003. Since shortly before his passing in 2012, Michael Droettboom has been the lead maintainer of Matplotlib, but, as has always been the case, Matplotlib is the work of many.

Prior to July of 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, the copyright of the source code was held by John Hunter. As of July 2013, and the 1.3.0 release, matplotlib has moved to a shared copyright model.

Matplotlib uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to Matplotlib. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the Matplotlib source code, in its entirety, is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire Matplotlib Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the matplotlib repositories.

The Matplotlib Development Team is the set of all contributors to the matplotlib project. A full list can be obtained from the git version control logs.

# Frequently Asked Questions

## I don't see a figure window

Please see \[figures-not-showing\](\#figures-not-showing).

## Why do I have so many ticks, and/or why are they out of order?

One common cause for unexpected tick behavior is passing a *list of strings instead of numbers or datetime objects*. This can easily happen without notice when reading in a comma-delimited text file. Matplotlib treats lists of strings as *categorical* variables (\[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/categorical\_variables\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/categorical\_variables.md)), and by default puts one tick per category, and plots them in the order in which they are supplied.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" data-align="center">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, layout='constrained', figsize=(6, 2))

ax\[0\].set\_title('Ticks seem out of order / misplaced') x = \['5', '20', '1', '9'\] \# strings y = \[5, 20, 1, 9\] ax\[0\].plot(x, y, 'd') ax\[0\].tick\_params(axis='x', labelcolor='red', labelsize=14)

ax\[1\].set\_title('Many ticks') x = \[str(xx) for xx in np.arange(100)\] \# strings y = np.arange(100) ax\[1\].plot(x, y) ax\[1\].tick\_params(axis='x', labelcolor='red', labelsize=14)

</div>

The solution is to convert the list of strings to numbers or datetime objects (often `np.asarray(numeric_strings, dtype='float')` or `np.asarray(datetime_strings, dtype='datetime64[s]')`).

For more information see \[/gallery/ticks/ticks\_too\_many\](/gallery/ticks/ticks\_too\_many.md).

## Determine the extent of Artists in the Figure

Sometimes we want to know the extent of an Artist. Matplotlib <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span> objects have a method <span class="title-ref">.Artist.get\_window\_extent</span> that will usually return the extent of the artist in pixels. However, some artists, in particular text, must be rendered at least once before their extent is known. Matplotlib supplies <span class="title-ref">.Figure.draw\_without\_rendering</span>, which should be called before calling `get_window_extent`.

## Check whether a figure is empty

Empty can actually mean different things. Does the figure contain any artists? Does a figure with an empty <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> still count as empty? Is the figure empty if it was rendered pure white (there may be artists present, but they could be outside the drawing area or transparent)?

For the purpose here, we define empty as: "The figure does not contain any artists except it's background patch." The exception for the background is necessary, because by default every figure contains a <span class="title-ref">.Rectangle</span> as it's background patch. This definition could be checked via:

    def is_empty(figure):
        """
        Return whether the figure contains no Artists (other than the default
        background patch).
        """
        contained_artists = figure.get_children()
        return len(contained_artists) <= 1

We've decided not to include this as a figure method because this is only one way of defining empty, and checking the above is only rarely necessary. Usually the user or program handling the figure know if they have added something to the figure.

The only reliable way to check whether a figure would render empty is to actually perform such a rendering and inspect the result.

## Find all objects in a figure of a certain type

Every Matplotlib artist (see \[artists\_tutorial\](\#artists\_tutorial)) has a method called <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.artist.Artist.findobj</span> that can be used to recursively search the artist for any artists it may contain that meet some criteria (e.g., match all <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span> instances or match some arbitrary filter function). For example, the following snippet finds every object in the figure which has a `set_color` property and makes the object blue:

    def myfunc(x):
        return hasattr(x, 'set_color')
    
    for o in fig.findobj(myfunc):
        o.set_color('blue')

You can also filter on class instances:

    import matplotlib.text as text
    for o in fig.findobj(text.Text):
        o.set_fontstyle('italic')

## Prevent ticklabels from having an offset

The default formatter will use an offset to reduce the length of the ticklabels. To turn this feature off on a per-axis basis:

    ax.xaxis.get_major_formatter().set_useOffset(False)

set `axes.formatter.useoffset`, or use a different formatter. See `~matplotlib.ticker` for details.

## Save transparent figures

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.savefig</span> command has a keyword argument *transparent* which, if 'True', will make the figure and axes backgrounds transparent when saving, but will not affect the displayed image on the screen.

If you need finer grained control, e.g., you do not want full transparency or you want to affect the screen displayed version as well, you can set the alpha properties directly. The figure has a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle</span> instance called *patch* and the axes has a Rectangle instance called *patch*. You can set any property on them directly (*facecolor*, *edgecolor*, *linewidth*, *linestyle*, *alpha*). e.g.:

    fig = plt.figure()
    fig.patch.set_alpha(0.5)
    ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
    ax.patch.set_alpha(0.5)

If you need *all* the figure elements to be transparent, there is currently no global alpha setting, but you can set the alpha channel on individual elements, e.g.:

    ax.plot(x, y, alpha=0.5)
    ax.set_xlabel('volts', alpha=0.5)

## Save multiple plots to one pdf file

Many image file formats can only have one image per file, but some formats support multi-page files. Currently, Matplotlib only provides multi-page output to pdf files, using either the pdf or pgf backends, via the <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span> and <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span> classes.

## Make room for tick labels

By default, Matplotlib uses fixed percentage margins around subplots. This can lead to labels overlapping or being cut off at the figure boundary. There are multiple ways to fix this:

  - Manually adapt the subplot parameters using <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplots\_adjust</span> / <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplots\_adjust</span>.
  - Use one of the automatic layout mechanisms:
      - constrained layout (\[constrainedlayout\_guide\](\#constrainedlayout\_guide))
      - tight layout (\[tight\_layout\_guide\](\#tight\_layout\_guide))
  - Calculate good values from the size of the plot elements yourself (\[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/auto\_subplots\_adjust\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/auto\_subplots\_adjust.md))

## Align my ylabels across multiple subplots

If you have multiple subplots over one another, and the y data have different scales, you can often get ylabels that do not align vertically across the multiple subplots, which can be unattractive. By default, Matplotlib positions the x location of the ylabel so that it does not overlap any of the y ticks. You can override this default behavior by specifying the coordinates of the label. To learn how, see \[/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/align\_ylabels\](/gallery/text\_labels\_and\_annotations/align\_ylabels.md)

## Control the draw order of plot elements

The draw order of plot elements, and thus which elements will be on top, is determined by the <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.set\_zorder</span> property. See \[/gallery/misc/zorder\_demo\](/gallery/misc/zorder\_demo.md) for a detailed description.

## Make the aspect ratio for plots equal

The Axes property <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.set\_aspect</span> controls the aspect ratio of the axes. You can set it to be 'auto', 'equal', or some ratio which controls the ratio:

    ax = fig.add_subplot(111, aspect='equal')

<div class="only">

html

See \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/axis\_equal\_demo\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/axis\_equal\_demo.md) for a complete example.

</div>

## Draw multiple y-axis scales

A frequent request is to have two scales for the left and right y-axis, which is possible using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.twinx</span> (more than two scales are not currently supported, though it is on the wish list). This works pretty well, though there are some quirks when you are trying to interactively pan and zoom, because both scales do not get the signals.

The approach uses <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.twinx</span> (and its sister <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.twiny</span>) to use *2 different axes*, turning the axes rectangular frame off on the 2nd axes to keep it from obscuring the first, and manually setting the tick locs and labels as desired. You can use separate `matplotlib.ticker` formatters and locators as desired because the two axes are independent.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure() ax1 = fig.add\_subplot(111) t = np.arange(0.01, 10.0, 0.01) s1 = np.exp(t) ax1.plot(t, s1, 'b-') ax1.set\_xlabel('time (s)') ax1.set\_ylabel('exp')

ax2 = ax1.twinx() s2 = np.sin(2\*np.pi\*t) ax2.plot(t, s2, 'r.') ax2.set\_ylabel('sin') plt.show()

</div>

<div class="only">

html

See \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/two\_scales\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/two\_scales.md) for a complete example.

</div>

## Generate images without having a window appear

Simply do not call <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.show</span>, and directly save the figure to the desired format:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.plot([1, 2, 3])
    plt.savefig('myfig.png')

<div class="seealso">

</div>

## Work with threads

Matplotlib is not thread-safe: in fact, there are known race conditions that affect certain artists. Hence, if you work with threads, it is your responsibility to set up the proper locks to serialize access to Matplotlib artists.

You may be able to work on separate figures from separate threads. However, you must in that case use a *non-interactive backend* (typically Agg), because most GUI backends *require* being run from the main thread as well.

## Get help<span id="reporting-problems"></span>

There are a number of good resources for getting help with Matplotlib. There is a good chance your question has already been asked:

  - The [mailing list archive](https://discourse.matplotlib.org/c/community/matplotlib-users/6).
  - [GitHub issues](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues).
  - Stackoverflow questions tagged [matplotlib](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/matplotlib).

If you are unable to find an answer to your question through search, please provide the following information in your e-mail to the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users):

  - Your operating system (Linux/Unix users: post the output of `uname -a`).

  - Matplotlib version:
    
        python -c "import matplotlib; print(matplotlib.__version__)"

  - Where you obtained Matplotlib (e.g., your Linux distribution's packages, GitHub, PyPI, or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)).

  - Any customizations to your `matplotlibrc` file (see \[customizing\](\#customizing)).

  - If the problem is reproducible, please try to provide a *minimal*, standalone Python script that demonstrates the problem. This is *the* critical step. If you can't post a piece of code that we can run and reproduce your error, the chances of getting help are significantly diminished. Very often, the mere act of trying to minimize your code to the smallest bit that produces the error will help you find a bug in *your* code that is causing the problem.

  - Matplotlib provides debugging information through the <span class="title-ref">logging</span> library, and a helper function to set the logging level: one can call :
    
        plt.set_loglevel("info")  # or "debug" for more info
    
    to obtain this debugging information.
    
    Standard functions from the <span class="title-ref">logging</span> module are also applicable; e.g. one could call `logging.basicConfig(level="DEBUG")` even before importing Matplotlib (this is in particular necessary to get the logging info emitted during Matplotlib's import), or attach a custom handler to the "matplotlib" logger. This may be useful if you use a custom logging configuration.

If you compiled Matplotlib yourself, please also provide:

  - your compiler version -- e.g., `gcc --version`.

  - the output of:
    
        pip install --verbose
    
    The beginning of the build output contains lots of details about your platform that are useful for the Matplotlib developers to diagnose your problem.

If you compiled an older version of Matplotlib using the pre-Meson build system, instead provide:

  - any changes you have made to `setup.py`/`setupext.py`,

  - the output of:
    
        rm -rf build
        python setup.py build

Including this information in your first e-mail to the mailing list will save a lot of time.

You will likely get a faster response writing to the mailing list than filing a bug in the bug tracker. Most developers check the bug tracker only periodically. If your problem has been determined to be a bug and cannot be quickly solved, you may be asked to file a bug in the tracker so the issue doesn't get lost.

# Data in 3D plots can now be dynamically clipped to the axes view limits

All 3D plotting functions now support the *axlim\_clip* keyword argument, which will clip the data to the axes view limits, hiding all data outside those bounds. This clipping will be dynamically applied in real time while panning and zooming.

Please note that if one vertex of a line segment or 3D patch is clipped, then the entire segment or patch will be hidden. Not being able to show partial lines or patches such that they are "smoothly" cut off at the boundaries of the view box is a limitation of the current renderer.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true" alt="Example of default behavior (blue) and axlim_clip=True (orange)">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot\_kw={"projection": "3d"}) x = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.5) y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.5) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) R = np.sqrt(X\**2 + Y*\*2) Z = np.sin(R)

\# Note that when a line has one vertex outside the view limits, the entire \# line is hidden. The same is true for 3D patches (not shown). \# In this example, data where x \< 0 or z \> 0.5 is clipped. ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='C0') ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, color='C1', axlim\_clip=True) ax.set(xlim=(0, 10), ylim=(-5, 5), zlim=(-1, 0.5)) ax.legend(\['axlim\_clip=False (default)', 'axlim\_clip=True'\])

# Instructions for writing "What's new" entries

Please place new portions of `whats_new.rst` in the `doc/users/next_whats_new/` directory.

When adding an entry please look at the currently existing files to see if you can extend any of them. If you create a file, name it something like `cool_new_feature.rst` if you have added a brand new feature or something like `updated_feature.rst` for extensions of existing features.

Include contents of the form:

    Section title for feature
    -------------------------
    
    A bunch of text about how awesome the new feature is and examples of how
    to use it.
    
    A sub-section
    ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please avoid using references in section titles, as it causes links to be confusing in the table of contents. Instead, ensure that a reference is included in the descriptive text.

# New more-accessible color cycle

A new color cycle named 'petroff10' was added. This cycle was constructed using a combination of algorithmically-enforced accessibility constraints, including color-vision-deficiency modeling, and a machine-learning-based aesthetics model developed from a crowdsourced color-preference survey. It aims to be both generally pleasing aesthetically and colorblind accessible such that it could serve as a default in the aim of universal design. For more details see [Petroff, M. A.: "Accessible Color Sequences for Data Visualization"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.02270) and related [SciPy talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gapv8wR5DYU). A demonstration is included in the style sheets [reference](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html). To load this color cycle in place of the default:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('petroff10')

# `matplotlib.ticker.EngFormatter` can computes offsets now

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.EngFormatter</span> has gained the ability to show an offset text near the axis. Using logic shared with <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.ScalarFormatter</span>, it is capable of deciding whether the data qualifies having an offset and show it with an appropriate SI quantity prefix, and with the supplied `unit`.

To enable this new behavior, simply pass `useOffset=True` when you instantiate <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.EngFormatter</span>. See example \[/gallery/ticks/engformatter\_offset\](/gallery/ticks/engformatter\_offset.md).

# Preliminary support for free-threaded CPython 3.13

Matplotlib 3.10 has preliminary support for the free-threaded build of CPython 3.13. See <https://py-free-threading.github.io>, [PEP 703](https://peps.python.org/pep-0703/) and the [CPython 3.13 release notes](https://docs.python.org/3.13/whatsnew/3.13.html#free-threaded-cpython) for more detail about free-threaded Python.

Support for free-threaded Python does not mean that Matplotlib is wholly thread safe. We expect that use of a Figure within a single thread will work, and though input data is usually copied, modification of data objects used for a plot from another thread may cause inconsistencies in cases where it is not. Use of any global state (such as the `pyplot` module) is highly discouraged and unlikely to work consistently. Also note that most GUI toolkits expect to run on the main thread, so interactive usage may be limited or unsupported from other threads.

If you are interested in free-threaded Python, for example because you have a multiprocessing-based workflow that you are interested in running with Python threads, we encourage testing and experimentation. If you run into problems that you suspect are because of Matplotlib, please open an issue, checking first if the bug also occurs in the “regular” non-free-threaded CPython 3.13 build.

# Vectorized `hist` style parameters

The parameters *hatch*, *edgecolor*, *facecolor*, *linewidth* and *linestyle* of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist</span> method are now vectorized. This means that you can pass in individual parameters for each histogram when the input *x* has multiple datasets.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true" alt="Four charts, each displaying stacked histograms of three Poisson distributions. Each chart differentiates the histograms using various parameters: top left uses different linewidths, top right uses different hatches, bottom left uses different edgecolors, and bottom right uses different facecolors. Each histogram on the left side also has a different edgecolor.">

# Increased Figure limits with Agg renderer

Figures using the Agg renderer are now limited to 2\**23 pixels in each direction, instead of 216. Additionally, bugs that caused artists to not render past 2*\*15 pixels horizontally have been fixed.

Note that if you are using a GUI backend, it may have its own smaller limits (which may themselves depend on screen size.)

# `InsetIndicator` artist

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.indicate\_inset</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.indicate\_inset\_zoom</span> now return an instance of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.inset.InsetIndicator</span> which contains the rectangle and connector patches. These patches now update automatically so that

mouse_rotation.md

# Rotating 3d plots with the mouse

Rotating three-dimensional plots with the mouse has been made more intuitive. The plot now reacts the same way to mouse movement, independent of the particular orientation at hand; and it is possible to control all 3 rotational degrees of freedom (azimuth, elevation, and roll). By default, it uses a variation on Ken Shoemake's ARCBALL\[1\]. The particular style of mouse rotation can be set via `axes3d.mouserotationstyle`. See also \[toolkit\_mouse-rotation\](\#toolkit\_mouse-rotation).

To revert to the original mouse rotation style, create a file `matplotlibrc` with contents:

    axes3d.mouserotationstyle: azel

To try out one of the various mouse rotation styles:

    import matplotlib as mpl
    mpl.rcParams['axes3d.mouserotationstyle'] = 'trackball'  # 'azel', 'trackball', 'sphere', or 'arcball'
    
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib import cm
    
    ax = plt.figure().add_subplot(projection='3d')
    
    X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25)
    X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y)
    R = np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)
    Z = np.sin(R)
    
    surf = ax.plot_surface(X, Y, Z, cmap=cm.coolwarm,
                           linewidth=0, antialiased=False)
    
    plt.show()

# Fix padding of single colorbar for `ImageGrid`

`ImageGrid` with `cbar_mode="single"` no longer adds the `axes_pad` between the axes and the colorbar for `cbar_location` "left" and "bottom". If desired, add additional spacing using `cbar_pad`.

pass_pandasDataFrame_into_table.md

# `ax.table` will accept a pandas DataFrame

The <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.table</span> method can now accept a Pandas DataFrame for the `cellText` argument.

`` `python import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import pandas as pd  data = {     'Letter': ['A', 'B', 'C'],     'Number': [100, 200, 300] }  df = pd.DataFrame(data) fig, ax = plt.subplots() table = ax.table(df, loc='center')  # or table = ax.table(cellText=df, loc='center') ax.axis('off') plt.show() ``\`

# Subfigures no longer provisional

The API on <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subfigures</span> and <span class="title-ref">.SubFigure</span> are now considered stable.

# Subfigures are now added in row-major order

`Figure.subfigures` are now added in row-major order for API consistency.

svg_id_rc.md

# `svg.id` rcParam

`svg.id` lets you insert an `id` attribute into the top-level `<svg>` tag.

e.g. `rcParams["svg.id"] = "svg1"` results in default), no `id` tag is included

`` `XML     <svg         xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink"         width="50pt" height="50pt"         viewBox="0 0 50 50"         xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"         version="1.1"         id="svg1"     ></svg>  This is useful if you would like to link the entire matplotlib SVG file within ``<span class="title-ref"> another SVG file with the </span><span class="title-ref">\<use\></span>\` tag.

`` `XML     <svg>     <use         width="50" height="50"         xlink:href="mpl.svg#svg1" id="use1"         x="0" y="0"     /></svg>  Where the ``\#svg1`indicator will now refer to the top level`\<svg\>`tag, and`\` will hence result in the inclusion of the entire file.

# List of changes to Matplotlib prior to 2015

This is a list of the changes made to Matplotlib from 2003 to 2015. For more recent changes, please refer to the \[/users/release\_notes\](/users/release\_notes.md).

  - 2015-11-16  
    Levels passed to contour(f) and tricontour(f) must be in increasing order.

  - 2015-10-21  
    Added TextBox widget

  - 2015-10-21  
    Added get\_ticks\_direction()

  - 2015-02-27  
    Added the rcParam 'image.composite\_image' to permit users to decide whether they want the vector graphics backends to combine all images within a set of axes into a single composite image. (If images do not get combined, users can open vector graphics files in Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape and edit each image individually.)

  - 2015-02-19  
    Rewrite of C++ code that calculates contours to add support for corner masking. This is controlled by the 'corner\_mask' keyword in plotting commands 'contour' and 'contourf'. - IMT

  - 2015-01-23  
    Text bounding boxes are now computed with advance width rather than ink area. This may result in slightly different placement of text.

  - 2014-10-27  
    Allowed selection of the backend using the `MPLBACKEND` environment variable. Added documentation on backend selection methods.

  - 2014-09-27  
    Overhauled <span class="title-ref">.colors.LightSource</span>. Added <span class="title-ref">.LightSource.hillshade</span> to allow the independent generation of illumination maps. Added new types of blending for creating more visually appealing shaded relief plots (e.g. `blend_mode="overlay"`, etc, in addition to the legacy "hsv" mode).

  - 2014-06-10  
    Added Colorbar.remove()

  - 2014-06-07  
    Fixed bug so radial plots can be saved as ps in py3k.

  - 2014-06-01  
    Changed the fmt kwarg of errorbar to support the mpl convention that "none" means "don't draw it", and to default to the empty string, so that plotting of data points is done with the plot() function defaults. Deprecated use of the None object in place "none".

  - 2014-05-22  
    Allow the linscale keyword parameter of symlog scale to be smaller than one.

  - 2014-05-20  
    Added logic in FontManager to invalidate font-cache if font-family rcparams have changed.

  - 2014-05-16  
    Fixed the positioning of multi-line text in the PGF backend.

  - 2014-05-14  
    Added Axes.add\_image() as the standard way to add AxesImage instances to Axes. This improves the consistency with add\_artist(), add\_collection(), add\_container(), add\_line(), add\_patch(), and add\_table().

  - 2014-05-02  
    Added colorblind-friendly colormap, named 'Wistia'.

  - 2014-04-27  
    Improved input clean up in Axes.{h|v}lines Coerce input into a 1D ndarrays (after dealing with units).

  - 2014-04-27  
    removed un-needed cast to float in stem

  - 2014-04-23  
    Updated references to "ipython -pylab" The preferred method for invoking pylab is now using the "%pylab" magic. -Chris G.

  - 2014-04-22  
    Added (re-)generate a simple automatic legend to "Figure Options" dialog of the Qt4Agg backend.

  - 2014-04-22  
    Added an example showing the difference between interpolation = 'none' and interpolation = 'nearest' in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.imshow</span> when saving vector graphics files.

  - 2014-04-22  
    Added violin plotting functions. See <span class="title-ref">.Axes.violinplot</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.violin</span>, <span class="title-ref">.cbook.violin\_stats</span> and <span class="title-ref">.mlab.GaussianKDE</span> for details.

  - 2014-04-10  
    Fixed the triangular marker rendering error. The "Up" triangle was rendered instead of "Right" triangle and vice-versa.

  - 2014-04-08  
    Fixed a bug in parasite\_axes.py by making a list out of a generator at line 263.

  - 2014-04-02  
    Added `clipon=False` to patch creation of wedges and shadows in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pie</span>.

  - 2014-02-25  
    In backend\_qt4agg changed from using update -\> repaint under windows. See comment in source near `self._priv_update` for longer explanation.

  - 2014-03-27  
    Added tests for pie ccw parameter. Removed pdf and svg images from tests for pie linewidth parameter.

  - 2014-03-24  
    Changed the behaviour of axes to not ignore leading or trailing patches of height 0 (or width 0) while calculating the x and y axis limits. Patches having both height == 0 and width == 0 are ignored.

  - 2014-03-24  
    Added bool kwarg (manage\_xticks) to boxplot to enable/disable the management of the xlimits and ticks when making a boxplot. Default in True which maintains current behavior by default.

  - 2014-03-23  
    Fixed a bug in projections/polar.py by making sure that the theta value being calculated when given the mouse coordinates stays within the range of 0 and 2 \* pi.

  - 2014-03-22  
    Added the keyword arguments wedgeprops and textprops to pie. Users can control the wedge and text properties of the pie in more detail, if they choose.

  - 2014-03-17  
    Bug was fixed in append\_axes from the AxesDivider class would not append axes in the right location with respect to the reference locator axes

  - 2014-03-13  
    Add parameter 'clockwise' to function pie, True by default.

  - 2014-02-28  
    Added 'origin' kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.spy</span>

  - 2014-02-27  
    Implemented separate horizontal/vertical axes padding to the ImageGrid in the AxesGrid toolkit

  - 2014-02-27  
    Allowed markevery property of matplotlib.lines.Line2D to be, an int numpy fancy index, slice object, or float. The float behaviour turns on markers at approximately equal display-coordinate-distances along the line.

  - 2014-02-25  
    In backend\_qt4agg changed from using update -\> repaint under windows. See comment in source near `self._priv_update` for longer explanation.

  - 2014-01-02  
    <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.triplot</span> now returns the artist it adds and support of line and marker kwargs has been improved. GBY

  - 2013-12-30  
    Made streamplot grid size consistent for different types of density argument. A 30x30 grid is now used for both density=1 and density=(1, 1).

  - 2013-12-03  
    Added a pure boxplot-drawing method that allow a more complete customization of boxplots. It takes a list of dicts contains stats. Also created a function (<span class="title-ref">.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span>) that generates the stats needed.

  - 2013-11-28  
    Added qhull extension module to perform Delaunay triangulation more robustly than before. It is used by tri.Triangulation (and hence all pyplot.tri\* methods) and mlab.griddata. Deprecated matplotlib.delaunay module. - IMT

  - 2013-11-05  
    Add power-law normalization method. This is useful for, e.g., showing small populations in a "hist2d" histogram.

  - 2013-10-27  
    Added get\_rlabel\_position and set\_rlabel\_position methods to PolarAxes to control angular position of radial tick labels.

  - 2013-10-06  
    Add stride-based functions to mlab for easy creation of 2D arrays with less memory.

  - 2013-10-06  
    Improve window and detrend functions in mlab, particular support for 2D arrays.

  - 2013-10-06  
    Improve performance of all spectrum-related mlab functions and plots.

  - 2013-10-06  
    Added support for magnitude, phase, and angle spectrums to axes.specgram, and support for magnitude, phase, angle, and complex spectrums to mlab-specgram.

  - 2013-10-06  
    Added magnitude\_spectrum, angle\_spectrum, and phase\_spectrum plots, as well as magnitude\_spectrum, angle\_spectrum, phase\_spectrum, and complex\_spectrum functions to mlab

  - 2013-07-12  
    Added support for datetime axes to 2d plots. Axis values are passed through Axes.convert\_xunits/Axes.convert\_yunits before being used by contour/contourf, pcolormesh and pcolor.

  - 2013-07-12  
    Allowed matplotlib.dates.date2num, matplotlib.dates.num2date, and matplotlib.dates.datestr2num to accept n-d inputs. Also factored in support for n-d arrays to matplotlib.dates.DateConverter and matplotlib.units.Registry.

  - 2013-06-26  
    Refactored the axes module: the axes module is now a folder, containing the following submodule:
    
      - \_subplots.py, containing all the subplots helper methods
      - \_base.py, containing several private methods and a new \_AxesBase class. This \_AxesBase class contains all the methods that are not directly linked to plots of the "old" Axes
      - \_axes.py contains the Axes class. This class now inherits from \_AxesBase: it contains all "plotting" methods and labelling methods.
    
    This refactoring should not affect the API. Only private methods are not importable from the axes module anymore.

  - 2013-05-18  
    Added support for arbitrary rasterization resolutions to the SVG backend. Previously the resolution was hard coded to 72 dpi. Now the backend class takes a image\_dpi argument for its constructor, adjusts the image bounding box accordingly and forwards a magnification factor to the image renderer. The code and results now resemble those of the PDF backend. - MW

  - 2013-05-08  
    Changed behavior of hist when given stacked=True and normed=True. Histograms are now stacked first, then the sum is normalized. Previously, each histogram was normalized, then they were stacked.

  - 2013-04-25  
    Changed all instances of:
    
        from matplotlib import MatplotlibDeprecationWarning as mplDeprecation
    
    to:
    
        from cbook import mplDeprecation
    
    and removed the import into the matplotlib namespace in \_\_init\_\_.py - Thomas Caswell

  - 2013-04-15  
    Added 'axes.xmargin' and 'axes.ymargin' to rpParams to set default margins on auto-scaling. - TAC

  - 2013-04-16  
    Added patheffect support for Line2D objects. -JJL

  - 2013-03-31  
    Added support for arbitrary unstructured user-specified triangulations to Axes3D.tricontour\[f\] - Damon McDougall

  - 2013-03-19  
    Added support for passing *linestyle* kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.step</span> so all <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> kwargs are passed to the underlying <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> call. -TAC

  - 2013-02-25  
    Added classes CubicTriInterpolator, UniformTriRefiner, TriAnalyzer to matplotlib.tri module. - GBy

  - 2013-01-23  
    Add 'savefig.directory' to rcParams to remember and fill in the last directory saved to for figure save dialogs - Martin Spacek

  - 2013-01-13  
    Add eventplot method to axes and pyplot and EventCollection class to collections.

  - 2013-01-08  
    Added two extra titles to axes which are flush with the left and right edges of the plot respectively. Andrew Dawson

  - 2013-01-07  
    Add framealpha keyword argument to legend - PO

  - 2013-01-16  
    Till Stensitzki added a baseline feature to stackplot

  - 2012-12-22  
    Added classes for interpolation within triangular grids (LinearTriInterpolator) and to find the triangles in which points lie (TrapezoidMapTriFinder) to matplotlib.tri module. - IMT

  - 2012-12-05  
    Added MatplotlibDeprecationWarning class for signaling deprecation. Matplotlib developers can use this class as follows:
    
        from matplotlib import MatplotlibDeprecationWarning as mplDeprecation
    
    In light of the fact that Python builtin DeprecationWarnings are ignored by default as of Python 2.7, this class was put in to allow for the signaling of deprecation, but via UserWarnings which are not ignored by default. - PI

  - 2012-11-27  
    Added the *mtext* parameter for supplying matplotlib.text.Text instances to RendererBase.draw\_tex and RendererBase.draw\_text. This allows backends to utilize additional text attributes, like the alignment of text elements. -pwuertz

  - 2012-11-26  
    deprecate matplotlib/mpl.py, which was used only in pylab.py and is now replaced by the more suitable `import matplotlib as mpl`. - PI

  - 2012-11-25  
    Make rc\_context available via pyplot interface - PI

  - 2012-11-16  
    plt.set\_cmap no longer throws errors if there is not already an active colorable artist, such as an image, and just sets up the colormap to use from that point forward. - PI

  - 2012-11-16  
    Added the function \_get\_rbga\_face, which is identical to \_get\_rbg\_face except it return a (r,g,b,a) tuble, to line2D. Modified Line2D.draw to use \_get\_rbga\_face to get the markerface color so that any alpha set by markerfacecolor will respected. - Thomas Caswell

  - 2012-11-13  
    Add a symmetric log normalization class to colors.py. Also added some tests for the normalization class. Till Stensitzki

  - 2012-11-12  
    Make axes.stem take at least one argument. Uses a default range(n) when the first arg not provided. Damon McDougall

  - 2012-11-09  
    Make plt.subplot() without arguments act as subplot(111) - PI

  - 2012-11-08  
    Replaced plt.figure and plt.subplot calls by the newer, more convenient single call to plt.subplots() in the documentation examples - PI

  - 2012-10-05  
    Add support for saving animations as animated GIFs. - JVDP

  - 2012-08-11  
    Fix path-closing bug in patches.Polygon, so that regardless of whether the path is the initial one or was subsequently set by set\_xy(), get\_xy() will return a closed path if and only if get\_closed() is True. Thanks to Jacob Vanderplas. - EF

  - 2012-08-05  
    When a norm is passed to contourf, either or both of the vmin, vmax attributes of that norm are now respected. Formerly they were respected only if both were specified. In addition, vmin and/or vmax can now be passed to contourf directly as kwargs. - EF

  - 2012-07-24  
    Contourf handles the extend kwarg by mapping the extended ranges outside the normed 0-1 range so that they are handled by colormap colors determined by the set\_under and set\_over methods. Previously the extended ranges were mapped to 0 or 1 so that the "under" and "over" colormap colors were ignored. This change also increases slightly the color contrast for a given set of contour levels. - EF

  - 2012-06-24  
    Make use of mathtext in tick labels configurable - DSD

  - 2012-06-05  
    Images loaded through PIL are now ordered correctly - CG

  - 2012-06-02  
    Add new Axes method and pyplot function, hist2d. - PO

  - 2012-05-31  
    Remove support for 'cairo.\<format\>' style of backend specification. Deprecate 'cairo.format' and 'savefig.extension' rcParams and replace with 'savefig.format'. - Martin Spacek

  - 2012-05-29  
    pcolormesh now obeys the passed in "edgecolor" kwarg. To support this, the "shading" argument to pcolormesh now only takes "flat" or "gouraud". To achieve the old "faceted" behavior, pass "edgecolors='k'". - MGD

  - 2012-05-22  
    Added radius kwarg to pie charts. - HH

  - 2012-05-22  
    Collections now have a setting "offset\_position" to select whether the offsets are given in "screen" coordinates (default, following the old behavior) or "data" coordinates. This is currently used internally to improve the performance of hexbin.
    
    As a result, the "draw\_path\_collection" backend methods have grown a new argument "offset\_position". - MGD

  - 2012-05-04  
    Add a new argument to pie charts - startingangle - that allows one to specify the angle offset for the first wedge of the chart. - EP

  - 2012-05-03  
    symlog scale now obeys the logarithmic base. Previously, it was completely ignored and always treated as base e. - MGD

  - 2012-05-03

  - 2011-07-15  
    The set of markers available in the plot() and scatter() commands has been unified. In general, this gives more options to both than were previously available, however, there is one backward-incompatible change to the markers in scatter:
    
    > "d" used to mean "diamond", it now means "narrow diamond". "D" can be used for a "diamond".

  - 2010-08-21  
    Change Axis.set\_view\_interval() so that when updating an existing interval, it respects the orientation of that interval, and can enlarge but not reduce the interval. This fixes a bug in which Axis.set\_ticks would change the view limits of an inverted axis. Whether set\_ticks should be affecting the viewLim at all remains an open question. - EF

    Change the way we do split/dividend adjustments in finance.py to handle dividends and fix the zero division bug reported in sf bug 2949906 and 2123566. Note that volume is not adjusted because the Yahoo CSV does not distinguish between share split and dividend adjustments making it near impossible to get volume adjustment right (unless we want to guess based on the size of the adjustment or scrape the html tables, which we don't) - JDH

    In an effort to simplify the backend API, all clipping rectangles and paths are now passed in using GraphicsContext objects, even on collections and images. Therefore:
    
        draw_path_collection(self, master_transform, cliprect, clippath,
                             clippath_trans, paths, all_transforms, offsets,

  - 2008-12-08  
    Some of the changes Michael made to improve the output of the property tables in the rest docs broke of made difficult to use some of the interactive doc helpers, e.g., setp and getp. Having all the rest markup in the ipython shell also confused the docstrings. I added a new rc param docstring.hardcopy, to format the docstrings differently for hard copy and other use. The ArtistInspector could use a little refactoring now since there is duplication of effort between the rest out put and the non-rest output - JDH

    Update the psd(), csd(), cohere(), and specgram() methods of Axes and the csd() cohere(), and specgram() functions in mlab to be in sync with the changes to psd(). In fact, under the hood, these all call the same core to do computations. - RM

  - 2008-11-11  
    Add 'pad\_to' and 'sides' parameters to mlab.psd() to allow controlling of zero padding and returning of negative frequency components, respectively. These are added in a way that does not change the API. - RM

    TRANSFORMS REFACTORING
    
    The primary goal of this refactoring was to make it easier to extend matplotlib to support new kinds of projections. This is primarily an internal improvement, and the possible user-visible changes it allows are yet to come.
    
    The transformation framework was completely rewritten in Python (with Numpy). This will make it easier to add news kinds of transformations without writing C/C++ code.
    
    Transforms are composed into a 'transform tree', made of transforms whose value depends on other transforms (their children). When the contents of children change, their parents are automatically updated to reflect those changes. To do this an "invalidation" method is used: when children change, all of their ancestors are marked as "invalid". When the value of a transform is accessed at a later time, its value is recomputed only if it is invalid, otherwise a cached value may be used. This prevents unnecessary recomputations of transforms, and contributes to better interactive performance.
    
    The framework can be used for both affine and non-affine transformations. However, for speed, we want use the backend renderers to perform affine transformations whenever possible. Therefore, it is possible to perform just the affine or non-affine part of a transformation on a set of data. The affine is always assumed to occur after the non-affine. For any transform:
    
        full transform == non-affine + affine
    
    Much of the drawing has been refactored in terms of compound paths. Therefore, many methods have been removed from the backend interface and replaced with a handful to draw compound paths. This will make updating the backends easier, since there is less to update. It also should make the backends more consistent in terms of functionality.
    
    User visible changes:
    
      - POLAR PLOTS: Polar plots are now interactively zoomable, and the r-axis labels can be interactively rotated. Straight line segments are now interpolated to follow the curve of the r-axis.
    
      - Non-rectangular clipping works in more backends and with more types of objects.
    
      - Sharing an axis across figures is now done in exactly the same way as sharing an axis between two axes in the same figure:
        
            fig1 = figure()
            fig2 = figure()
            
            ax1 = fig1.add_subplot(111)
            ax2 = fig2.add_subplot(111, sharex=ax1, sharey=ax1)
    
      - linestyles now include steps-pre, steps-post and steps-mid. The old step still works and is equivalent to step-pre.
    
      - Multiple line styles may be provided to a collection.
    
    See API\_CHANGES for more low-level information about this refactoring.

  - 2007-10-24  
    Added ax kwarg to Figure.colorbar and pyplot.colorbar - EF

  - 2007-10-19  
    Removed a gsave/grestore pair surrounding \_draw\_ps, which was causing a loss graphics state info (see "EPS output problem - scatter & edgecolors" on mpl-dev, 2007-10-29) - DSD

  - 2007-10-15  
    Fixed a bug in patches.Ellipse that was broken for aspect='auto'. Scale free ellipses now work properly for equal and auto on Agg and PS, and they fall back on a polygonal approximation for nonlinear transformations until we convince ourselves that the spline approximation holds for nonlinear transformations. Added unit/ellipse\_compare.py to compare spline with vertex approx for both aspects. JDH

  - 2007-10-05  
    remove generator expressions from texmanager and mpltraits. generator expressions are not supported by python-2.3 - DSD

    Made skiprows=1 the default on csv2rec - JDH

  - 2007-09-09  
    Split out the plotting part of pylab and put it in pyplot.py; removed numerix from the remaining pylab.py, which imports everything from pyplot.py. The intention is that apart from cleanups, the result of importing from pylab is nearly unchanged, but there is the new alternative of importing from pyplot to get the state-engine graphics without all the numeric functions. Numpified examples; deleted two that were obsolete; modified some to use pyplot. - EF

  - 2007-09-08  
    Eliminated gd and paint backends - EF

  - 2007-09-06  
    .bmp file format is now longer an alias for .raw

  - 2007-09-06  
    Refactored image saving code so that all GUI backends can save most image types. See FILETYPES for a matrix of backends and their supported file types. Backend canvases should no longer write their own print\_figure() method -- instead they should write a print\_xxx method for each filetype they can output and add an entry to their class-scoped filetypes dictionary. - MGD

  - 2007-09-05  
    Fixed Qt version reporting in setupext.py - DSD

  - 2007-09-04

  - 2007-08-06  
    Removed mathtext2

  - 2007-07-31  
    Refactoring of distutils scripts.
    
      - Will not fail on the entire build if an optional Python package (e.g., Tkinter) is installed but its development headers are not (e.g., tk-devel). Instead, it will continue to build all other extensions.
      - Provide an overview at the top of the output to display what dependencies and their versions were found, and (by extension) what will be built.
      - Use pkg-config, when available, to find freetype2, since this was broken on Mac OS-X when using MacPorts in a non- standard location.

  - 2007-07-30  
    Reorganized configuration code to work with traited config objects. The new config system is located in the matplotlib.config package, but it is disabled by default. To enable it, set NEWCONFIG=True in matplotlib.\_\_init\_\_.py. The new configuration system will still use the old matplotlibrc files by default. To switch to the experimental, traited configuration, set USE\_TRAITED\_CONFIG=True in config.\_\_init\_\_.py.

  - 2007-07-29  
    Changed default pcolor shading to flat; added aliases to make collection kwargs agree with setter names, so updating works; related minor cleanups. Removed quiver\_classic, scatter\_classic, pcolor\_classic. - EF

  - 2007-07-26  
    Major rewrite of mathtext.py, using the TeX box layout model.
    
    There is one (known) backward incompatible change. The font commands (cal, rm, it, tt) now behave as TeX does: they are in effect until the next font change command or the end of the grouping. Therefore uses of $cal{R}$ should be changed to ${cal R}$. Alternatively, you may use the new LaTeX-style font commands (mathcal, mathrm, mathit, mathtt) which do affect the following group, e.g., $mathcal{R}$.
    
    Other new features include:
    
      - Math may be interspersed with non-math text. Any text with an even number of $'s (non-escaped) will be sent to the mathtext parser for layout.
      - Sub/superscripts are less likely to accidentally overlap.
      - Support for sub/superscripts in either order, e.g., $x^i\_j$ and $x\_j^i$ are equivalent.
      - Double sub/superscripts (e.g., $x\_i\_j$) are considered ambiguous and raise an exception. Use braces to disambiguate.
      - $frac{x}{y}$ can be used for displaying fractions.
      - $sqrt\[3\]{x}$ can be used to display the radical symbol with a root number and body.
      - $left(frac{x}{y}right)$ may be used to create parentheses and other delimiters that automatically resize to the height of their contents.
      - Spacing around operators etc. is now generally more like TeX.
      - Added support (and fonts) for boldface (bf) and sans-serif (sf) symbols.
      - Log-like function name shortcuts are supported. For example, $sin(x)$ may be used instead of ${rm sin}(x)$
      - Limited use of kerning for the easy case (same font)
    
    Behind the scenes, the pyparsing.py module used for doing the math parsing was updated to the latest stable version (1.4.6). A lot of duplicate code was refactored out of the Font classes.

    Fixed problem with imshow and matshow of integer arrays; fixed problems with changes to color autoscaling. - EF

  - 2007-04-01  
    Made image color autoscaling work correctly with a tracking colorbar; norm.autoscale now scales unconditionally, while norm.autoscale\_None changes only None-valued vmin, vmax. - EF

    Some more niceties for xcorr -- a maxlags option, normed now works for xcorr as well as axorr, usevlines is supported, and a zero correlation hline is added. See examples/xcorr\_demo.py. Thanks Sameer for the patch. - JDH

  - 2007-03-21  
    Axes.vlines and Axes.hlines now create and returns a LineCollection, not a list of lines. This is much faster. The kwarg signature has changed, so consult the docs. Modified Axes.errorbar which uses vlines and hlines. See API\_CHANGES; the return signature for these three functions is now different

    Change barh to take a kwargs dict and pass it to bar. Fixes sf bug \#1669506.

  - 2007-03-02  
    Add rc parameter pdf.inheritcolor, which disables all color-setting operations in the pdf backend. The idea is that you include the resulting file in another program and set the colors (both stroke and fill color) there, so you can use the same pdf file for e.g., a paper and a presentation and have them in the surrounding color. You will probably not want to draw figure and axis frames in that case, since they would be filled in the same color. - JKS

    Prevent building \_wxagg.so with broken Mac OS X wxPython. - ADS

  - 2007-02-23  
    Require setuptools for Python 2.3 - ADS

  - 2007-02-22  
    WXAgg accelerator updates - KM
    
    WXAgg's C++ accelerator has been fixed to use the correct wxBitmap constructor.
    
    The backend has been updated to use new wxPython functionality to provide fast blit() animation without the C++ accelerator. This requires wxPython 2.8 or later. Previous versions of wxPython can use the C++ accelerator or the old pure Python routines.
    
    setup.py no longer builds the C++ accelerator when wxPython \>= 2.8 is present.
    
    The blit() method is now faster regardless of which agg/wxPython conversion routines are used.

  - 2007-02-21  
    Applied the PDF backend patch by Nicolas Grilly. This impacts several files and directories in matplotlib:
    
      - Created the directory lib/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/pdfcorefonts, holding AFM files for the 14 PDF core fonts. These fonts are embedded in every PDF viewing application.
      - setup.py: Added the directory pdfcorefonts to package\_data.
      - lib/matplotlib/\_\_init\_\_.py: Added the default parameter 'pdf.use14corefonts'. When True, the PDF backend uses only the 14 PDF core fonts.
      - lib/matplotlib/afm.py: Added some keywords found in recent AFM files. Added a little workaround to handle Euro symbol.
      - lib/matplotlib/fontmanager.py: Added support for the 14 PDF core fonts. These fonts have a dedicated cache (file pdfcorefont.cache), not the same as for other AFM files (file .afmfont.cache). Also cleaned comments to conform to CODING\_GUIDE.
      - lib/matplotlib/backends/backend\_pdf.py: Added support for 14 PDF core fonts. Fixed some issues with incorrect character widths and encodings (works only for the most common encoding, WinAnsiEncoding, defined by the official PDF Reference). Removed parameter 'dpi' because it causes alignment issues.

    Moved data files into lib/matplotlib so that setuptools' develop mode works. Re-organized the mpl-data layout so that this source structure is maintained in the installation. (i.e., the 'fonts' and 'images' sub-directories are maintained in site-packages.) Suggest removing site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data and \~/.matplotlib/ttffont.cache before installing - ADS

  - 2007-02-07  
    Committed Rob Hetland's patch for qt4: remove references to text()/latin1(), plus some improvements to the toolbar layout - DSD

    Extended the new picker API to text, patches and patch collections. Added support for user customizable pick hit testing and attribute tagging of the PickEvent - Details and examples in examples/pick\_event\_demo.py - JDH

  - 2007-01-16  
    Begun work on a new pick API using the mpl event handling framework. Artists will define their own pick method with a configurable epsilon tolerance and return pick attrs. All artists that meet the tolerance threshold will fire a PickEvent with artist dependent attrs; e.g., a Line2D can set the indices attribute that shows the indices into the line that are within epsilon of the pick point. See examples/pick\_event\_demo.py. The implementation of pick for the remaining Artists remains to be done, but the core infrastructure at the level of event handling is in place with a proof-of-concept implementation for Line2D - JDH

  - 2007-01-10  
    Added "Subplot.label\_outer" method. It will set the visibility of the ticklabels so that yticklabels are only visible in the first column and xticklabels are only visible in the last row - JDH

  - 2007-01-02  
    Added additional kwarg documentation - JDH

  - 2006-12-28  
    Improved error message for nonpositive input to log transform; added log kwarg to bar, barh, and hist, and modified bar method to behave sensibly by default when the ordinate has a log scale. (This only works if the log scale is set before or by the call to bar, hence the utility of the log kwarg.) - EF

  - 2006-12-27  
    backend\_cairo.py: update draw\_image() and \_draw\_mathtext() to work with numpy - SC

    Made pcolor support vector X and/or Y instead of requiring 2-D arrays - EF

  - 2006-12-05  
    Made the default Artist.\_transform None (rather than invoking identity\_transform for each artist only to have it overridden later). Use artist.get\_transform() rather than artist.\_transform, even in derived classes, so that the default transform will be created lazily as needed -JDH

  - 2006-12-03  
    Added LogNorm to colors.py as illustrated by examples/pcolor\_log.py, based on suggestion by Jim McDonald. Colorbar modified to handle LogNorm. Norms have additional "inverse" method. - EF

  - 2006-12-02  
    Changed class names in colors.py to match convention: normalize -\> Normalize, no\_norm -\> NoNorm. Old names are still available. Changed \_\_init\_\_.py rc defaults to match those in matplotlibrc - EF

    Fixed bug in [set]()\*lim that I had introduced on 11-15 - EF

  - 2006-11-22  
    Added examples/clippedline.py, which shows how to clip line data based on view limits -- it also changes the marker style when zoomed in - JDH

    Some spy bug-fixes and added precision arg per Robert C's suggestion - JDH

  - 2006-11-19

    Improved the ability of the colorbar to track changes in corresponding image, pcolor, or contourf. - EF

  - 2006-11-11  
    Fixed bug that broke Numeric compatibility; added support for alpha to colorbar. The alpha information is taken from the mappable object, not specified as a kwarg. - EF

  - 2006-11-05  
    Added broken\_barh function for making a sequence of horizontal bars broken by gaps -- see examples/broken\_barh.py

  - 2006-11-05  
    Removed lineprops and markerprops from the Annotation code and replaced them with an arrow configurable with kwarg arrowprops. See examples/annotation\_demo.py - JDH

  - 2006-10-11  
    commented out all default values in matplotlibrc.template Default values should generally be taken from defaultParam in \_\_init\_\_.py - the file matplotlib should only contain those values that the user wants to explicitly change from the default. (see thread "marker color handling" on matplotlib-devel)

    Changed default comment character for load to '\#' - JDH

  - 2006-10-10

  - 2006-06-29  
    Added a Qt4Agg backend. Thank you James Amundson - DSD

  - 2006-06-26  
    Fixed a usetex bug. On Windows, usetex will process postscript output in the current directory rather than in a temp directory. This is due to the use of spaces and tildes in windows paths, which cause problems with latex. The subprocess module is no longer used. - DSD

  - 2006-06-22  
    Various changes to bar(), barh(), and hist(). Added 'edgecolor' keyword arg to bar() and barh(). The x and y args in barh() have been renamed to width and bottom respectively, and their order has been swapped to maintain a (position, value) order ala matlab. left, height, width and bottom args can now all be scalars or sequences. barh() now defaults to edge alignment instead of center alignment. Added a keyword arg 'align' to bar(), barh() and hist() that controls between edge or center bar alignment. Fixed ignoring the rcParams\['patch.facecolor'\] for bar color in bar() and barh(). Fixed ignoring the rcParams\['lines.color'\] for error bar color in bar() and barh(). Fixed a bug where patches would be cleared when error bars were plotted if rcParams\['axes.hold'\] was False. - MAS

  - 2006-06-22

    Added a pointer to parent in figure canvas so you can access the container with fig.canvas.manager. Useful if you want to set the window title, e.g., in gtk fig.canvas.manager.window.set\_title, though a GUI neutral method would be preferable JDH

  - 2006-06-16  
    Fixed colorbar.py to handle indexed colors (i.e., norm = no\_norm()) by centering each colored region on its index. - EF

  - 2006-06-15  
    Added scalex and scaley to Axes.autoscale\_view to support selective autoscaling just the x or y axis, and supported these command in plot so you can say plot(something, scaley=False) and just the x axis will be autoscaled. Modified axvline and axhline to support this, so for example axvline will no longer autoscale the y axis. JDH

  - 2005-11-27  
    Multiple changes in cm.py, colors.py, figure.py, image.py, contour.py, contour\_demo.py; new \_cm.py, examples/image\_masked.py.
    
    1.  Separated the color table data from cm.py out into a new file, \_cm.py, to make it easier to find the actual code in cm.py and to add new colormaps. Also added some line breaks to the color data dictionaries. Everything from \_cm.py is imported by cm.py, so the split should be transparent.
    2.  Enabled automatic generation of a colormap from a list of colors in contour; see modified examples/contour\_demo.py.
    3.  Support for imshow of a masked array, with the ability to specify colors (or no color at all) for masked regions, and for regions that are above or below the normally mapped region. See examples/image\_masked.py.
    4.  In support of the above, added two new classes, ListedColormap, and no\_norm, to colors.py, and modified the Colormap class to include common functionality. Added a clip kwarg to the normalize class. Reworked color handling in contour.py, especially in the ContourLabeller mixin.

    Made HOME/.matplotlib the new config dir where the matplotlibrc file, the ttf.cache, and the tex.cache live. The new default filenames in .matplotlib have no leading dot and are not hidden. e.g., the new names are matplotlibrc tex.cache ttffont.cache. This is how ipython does it so it must be right. If old files are found, a warning is issued and they are moved to the new location. Also fixed texmanager to put all files, including temp files in \~/.matplotlib/tex.cache, which allows you to usetex in non-writable dirs.

    Move Figure.get\_width\_height() to FigureCanvasBase and return int instead of float. - SC

  - 2005-06-18  
    Applied Ted Drain's QtAgg patch: 1) Changed the toolbar to be a horizontal bar of push buttons instead of a QToolbar and updated the layout algorithms in the main window accordingly. This eliminates the ability to drag and drop the toolbar and detach it from the window. 2) Updated the resize algorithm in the main window to show the correct size for the plot widget as requested. This works almost correctly right now. It looks to me like the final size of the widget is off by the border of the main window but I haven't figured out a way to get that information yet. We could just add a small margin to the new size but that seems a little hacky. 3) Changed the x/y location label to be in the toolbar like the Tk backend instead of as a status line at the bottom of the widget. 4) Changed the toolbar pixmaps to use the ppm files instead of the png files. I noticed that the Tk backend buttons looked much nicer and it uses the ppm files so I switched them.

-----

## 0.82 (2005-06-15)

  - 2005-06-15  
    Added subplot config tool to GTK\* backends -- note you must now import the NavigationToolbar2 from your backend of choice rather than from backend\_gtk because it needs to know about the backend specific canvas -- see examples/embedding\_in\_gtk2.py.

  - 2005-05-27  
    Got win32 build system working again, using a more recent version of gtk and pygtk in the win32 build, gtk 2.6 from <https://web.archive.org/web/20050527002647/https://www.gimp.org/~tml/gimp/win32/downloads.html> (you will also need libpng12.dll to use these). I haven't tested whether this binary build of mpl for win32 will work with older gtk runtimes, so you may need to upgrade.

    Added Daishi text with dash patch -- see examples/dashtick.py

  - 2005-05-26  
    Moved backend\_latex functionality into backend\_ps. If text.usetex=True, the PostScript backend will use LaTeX to generate the .ps or .eps file. Ghostscript is required for eps output. - DSD

    Applied Eric Firing's masked data lines patch and contour patch. Support for masked arrays has been added to the plot command and to the Line2D object. Only the valid points are plotted. A "valid\_only" kwarg was added to the get\_xdata() and get\_ydata() methods of Line2D; by default it is False, so that the original data arrays are returned. Setting it to True returns the plottable points. - see examples/masked\_demo.py - JDH

  - 2005-03-16  
    Added Japanese winreg patch - JDH

  - 2005-03-15  
    backend\_gtkagg.py: changed to use double buffering, this fixes the problem reported Joachim Berdal Haga - "Parts of plot lagging from previous frame in animation". Tested with anim.py and it makes no noticeable difference to performance (23.7 before, 23.6 after) - SC

  - 2005-03-14  
    add src/\_backend\_gdk.c extension to provide a substitute function for pixbuf.get\_pixels\_array(). Currently pixbuf.get\_pixels\_array() only works with Numeric, and then only works if pygtk has been compiled with Numeric support. The change provides a function pixbuf\_get\_pixels\_array() which works with Numeric and numarray and is always available. It means that backend\_gtk should be able to display images and mathtext in all circumstances. - SC

  - 2005-03-11  
    Upgraded CXX to 5.3.1

  - 2005-03-10  
    remove GraphicsContextPS.set\_linestyle() and GraphicsContextSVG.set\_linestyle() since they do no more than the base class GraphicsContext.set\_linestyle() - SC

  - 2005-03-09  
    Refactored contour functionality into dedicated module

  - 2005-03-09  
    Added Eric's contourf updates and Nadia's clabel functionality

  - 2005-03-09  
    Moved colorbar to figure.Figure to expose it for API developers - JDH

  - 2005-03-09  
    backend\_cairo.py: implemented draw\_markers() - SC

  - 2005-03-09  
    cbook.py: only use enumerate() (the python version) if the builtin version is not available. Add new function 'izip' which is set to itertools.izip if available and the python equivalent if not available. - SC

  - 2005-03-07  
    backend\_gdk.py: remove PIXELS\_PER\_INCH from points\_to\_pixels(), but still use it to adjust font sizes. This allows the GTK version of line\_styles.py to more closely match GTKAgg, previously the markers were being drawn too large. - SC

  - 2005-03-01  
    Added Eric's contourf routines

  - 2005-03-01  
    Added start of proper agg SWIG wrapper. I would like to expose agg functionality directly a the user level and this module will serve that purpose eventually, and will hopefully take over most of the functionality of the current \_image and \_backend\_agg modules. - JDH

  - 2005-02-28  
    Fixed polyfit / polyval to convert input args to float arrays - JDH

  - 2005-02-25  
    Add experimental feature to backend\_gtk.py to enable/disable double buffering (DBL\_BUFFER=True/False) - SC

  - 2005-02-24  
    colors.py change ColorConverter.to\_rgb() so it always returns rgb (and not rgba), allow cnames keys to be cached, change the exception raised from RuntimeError to ValueError (like hex2color()) hex2color() use a regular expression to check the color string is valid - SC

  - 2005-02-23  
    Added rc param ps.useafm so backend ps can use native afm fonts or truetype. afme breaks mathtext but causes much smaller font sizes and may result in images that display better in some contexts (e.g., pdfs incorporated into latex docs viewed in acrobat reader). I would like to extend this approach to allow the user to use truetype only for mathtext, which should be easy.

  - 2005-02-23  
    Used sequence protocol rather than tuple in agg collection drawing routines for greater flexibility - JDH

  - 2005-01-19  
    Restored builtin names which were overridden (min, max, abs, round, and sum) in pylab. This is a potentially significant change for those who were relying on an array version of those functions that previously overrode builtin function names. - ADS

  - 2005-01-18  
    Added accents to mathtext: hat, breve, grave, bar, acute, tilde, vec, dot, ddot. All of them have the same syntax, e.g., to make an overbar you do bar{o} or to make an o umlaut you do ddot{o}. The shortcuts are also provided, e.g., "o 'e \`e \~n .x ^y - JDH

  - 2004-12-28  
    Fixed coords notification in wx toolbar - JDH

  - 2004-12-28  
    Moved connection and disconnection event handling to the FigureCanvasBase. Backends now only need to connect one time for each of the button press, button release and key press/release functions. The base class deals with callbacks and multiple connections. This fixes flakiness on some backends (tk, wx) in the presence of multiple connections and/or disconnect - JDH

  - 2004-12-27  
    Fixed PS mathtext bug where color was not set - Jochen please verify correct - JDH

  - 2004-12-27

    Fixed colorbar bug which caused colorbar not to respond to changes in colormap in some instances - JDH

  - 2004-12-22  
    Refactored NavigationToolbar in tkagg to support app embedding , init now takes (canvas, window) rather than (canvas, figman) - JDH

  - 2004-12-21  
    Refactored axes and subplot management - removed add\_subplot and add\_axes from the FigureManager. classic toolbar updates are done via an observer pattern on the figure using add\_axobserver. Figure now maintains the axes stack (for gca) and supports axes deletion. Ported changes to GTK, Tk, Wx, and FLTK. Please test\! Added delaxes - JDH

  - 2004-12-21  
    Lots of image optimizations - 4x performance boost over 0.65 JDH

    colors.py: rgb2hex(), hex2color() made simpler (and faster), also rgb2hex() - added round() instead of integer truncation hex2color() - changed 256.0 divisor to 255.0, so now '\#ffffff' becomes (1.0,1.0,1.0) not (0.996,0.996,0.996) - SC

  - 2004-12-11  
    Added ion and ioff to pylab interface - JDH

  - 2004-12-11  
    backend\_template.py: delete FigureCanvasTemplate.realize() - most backends don't use it and its no longer needed
    
    backend\_ps.py, backend\_svg.py: delete show() and draw\_if\_interactive() -they are not needed for image backends
    
    backend\_svg.py: write direct to file instead of StringIO

    Zoom to rect now respect reversed axes limits (for both linear and log axes). - GL

  - 2004-11-29  
    Added the over command to the matlab interface. over allows you to add an overlay plot regardless of hold state. - JDH

  - 2004-11-25  
    Added Printf to mplutils for printf style format string formatting in C++ (should help write better exceptions)

    backend\_gtk.py: Made fix suggested by <maffew@cat.org.au> to prevent problems when py2exe calls pygtk.require(). - SC

  - 2004-11-09  
    backend\_cairo.py: Added support for printing to a fileobject. Disabled cairo PS output which is not working correctly. - SC

-----

## 0.64 (2004-11-08)

  - 2004-11-04  
    Changed -dbackend processing to only use known backends, so we don't clobber other non-matplotlib uses of -d, like -debug.

  - 2004-11-04  
    backend\_agg.py: added IMAGE\_FORMAT to list the formats that the backend can save to. backend\_gtkagg.py: added support for saving JPG files by using the GTK backend - SC

  - 2004-10-31  
    backend\_cairo.py: now produces png and ps files (although the figure sizing needs some work). pycairo did not wrap all the necessary functions, so I wrapped them myself, they are included in the backend\_cairo.py doc string. - SC

  - 2004-10-31  
    backend\_ps.py: clean up the generated PostScript code, use the PostScript stack to hold intermediate values instead of storing them in the dictionary. - JV

  - 2004-10-30  
    backend\_ps.py, ft2font.cpp, ft2font.h: fix the position of text in the PostScript output. The new FT2Font method get\_descent gives the distance between the lower edge of the bounding box and the baseline of a string. In backend\_ps the text is shifted upwards by this amount. - JV

  - 2004-10-30  
    backend\_ps.py: clean up the code a lot. Change the PostScript output to be more DSC compliant. All definitions for the generated PostScript are now in a PostScript dictionary 'mpldict'. Moved the long comment about drawing ellipses from the PostScript output into a Python comment. - JV

  - 2004-10-30  
    backend\_gtk.py: removed FigureCanvasGTK.realize() as its no longer needed. Merged ColorManager into GraphicsContext backend\_bases.py: For set\_capstyle/joinstyle() only set cap or joinstyle if there is no error. -SC

  - 2004-10-30  
    backend\_gtk.py: tidied up print\_figure() and removed some of the dependency on widget events - SC

  - 2004-10-28  
    backend\_cairo.py: The renderer is complete except for mathtext, draw\_image() and clipping. gtkcairo works reasonably well. cairo does not yet create any files since I can't figure how to set the 'target surface', I don't think pycairo wraps the required functions - SC

  - 2004-10-28  
    backend\_gtk.py: Improved the save dialog (GTK 2.4 only) so it presents the user with a menu of supported image formats - SC

  - 2004-10-28  
    backend\_svg.py: change print\_figure() to restore original face/edge color backend\_ps.py : change print\_figure() to ensure original face/edge colors are restored even if there's an IOError - SC

  - 2004-10-21  
    Added polar axes and plots - JDH

  - 2004-10-20  
    Fixed corrcoef bug exposed by corrcoef(X) where X is matrix - JDH

  - 2004-10-16  
    Streamlined the matlab interface wrapper, removed the noplot option to hist - just use mlab.hist instead.

  - 2004-09-30  
    Added Andrew Dalke's strftime code to extend the range of dates supported by the DateFormatter - JDH

  - 2004-09-30  
    Added barh - JDH

  - 2004-09-30  
    Removed fallback to alternate array package from numerix so that ImportErrors are easier to debug. - JTM

  - 2004-09-30  
    Add GTK+ 2.4 support for the message in the toolbar. SC

  - 2004-09-30  
    Made some changes to support python22 - lots of doc fixes. - JDH

  - 2004-09-29  
    Added a Verbose class for reporting - JDH

-----

  - 2004-09-28  
    Released 0.63.0

    Added save to file object for agg - see examples/print\_stdout.py

  - 2004-09-24  
    Reorganized all py code to lib subdir

  - 2004-09-24  
    Fixed axes resize image edge effects on interpolation - required upgrade to agg22 which fixed an agg bug related to this problem

  - 2004-09-20  
    Added toolbar2 message display for backend\_tkagg. JTM

  - 2004-09-17  
    Added coords formatter attributes. These must be callable, and return a string for the x or y data. These will be used to format the x and y data for the coords box. Default is the axis major formatter. e.g.:
    
        # format the coords message box
        def price(x): return '$%1.2f'%x
        ax.format_xdata = DateFormatter('%Y-%m-%d')
        ax.format_ydata = price

  - 2004-09-17  
    Total rewrite of dates handling to use python datetime with num2date, date2num and drange. pytz for timezone handling, dateutils for spohisticated ticking. date ranges from 0001-9999 are supported. rrules allow arbitrary date ticking. examples/date\_demo\*.py converted to show new usage. new example examples/date\_demo\_rrule.py shows how to use rrules in date plots. The date locators are much more general and almost all of them have different constructors. See matplotlib.dates for more info.

  - 2004-09-15  
    Applied Fernando's backend \_\_init\_\_ patch to support easier backend maintenance. Added his numutils to mlab. JDH

  - 2004-09-16  
    Re-designated all files in matplotlib/images as binary and w/o keyword substitution using "cvs admin -kb \*.svg ...". See binary files in "info cvs" under Linux. This was messing up builds from CVS on windows since CVS was doing lf -\> cr/lf and keyword substitution on the bitmaps. - JTM

  - 2004-09-15  
    Modified setup to build array-package-specific extensions for those extensions which are array-aware.

-----

This is the Old, stale, never used changelog

  - 2002-12-10
    
      - Added a TODO file and CHANGELOG. Lots to do -- get crackin'\!
      - Fixed y zoom tool bug
      - Adopted a compromise fix for the y data clipping problem. The problem was that for solid lines, the y data clipping (as opposed to the gc clipping) caused artifactual horizontal solid lines near the ylim boundaries. I did a 5% offset hack in Axes set\_ylim functions which helped, but didn't cure the problem for very high gain y zooms. So I disabled y data clipping for connected lines . If you need extensive y clipping, either plot(y,x) because x data clipping is always enabled, or change the \_set\_clip code to 'if 1' as indicated in the lines.py src. See \_set\_clip in lines.py and set\_ylim in figure.py for more information.

  - 2002-12-11
    
      - Added a measurement dialog to the figure window to measure axes position and the delta x delta y with a left mouse drag. These defaults can be overridden by deriving from Figure and overriding button\_press\_event, button\_release\_event, and motion\_notify\_event, and \_dialog\_measure\_tool.
      - fixed the navigation dialog so you can check the axes the navigation buttons apply to.

  - 2003-04-23  
    Released matplotlib v0.1

  - 2003-04-24  
    Added a new line style PixelLine2D which is the plots the markers as pixels (as small as possible) with format symbol ','
    
    Added a new class Patch with derived classes Rectangle, RegularPolygon and Circle

  - 2003-04-25  
    Implemented new functions errorbar, scatter and hist
    
    Added a new line type '') where y.shape = len(x),2 and each row gives the ymin,ymax for the respective values of x. Previously I had implemented vlines as a list of lines, but I needed the efficiency of the numeric clipping for large numbers of vlines outside the viewport, so I wrote a dedicated class Vline2D which derives from Line2D

  - 2003-05-01  
    Fixed ytick bug where grid and tick show outside axis viewport with gc clip

  - 2003-05-14  
    Added new ways to specify colors 1) matlab format string 2) html-style hex string, 3) rgb tuple. See examples/color\_demo.py

  - 2003-05-28  
    Changed figure rendering to draw form a pixmap to reduce flicker. See examples/system\_monitor.py for an example where the plot is continuously updated w/o flicker. This example is meant to simulate a system monitor that shows free CPU, RAM, etc...

  - 2003-08-04  
    Added Jon Anderson's GTK shell, which doesn't require pygtk to have threading built-in and looks nice\!

  - 2003-08-25  
    Fixed deprecation warnings for python2.3 and pygtk-1.99.18

  - 2003-08-26

    Added a postscript and a GD module backend

  - 2003-09-16  
    Fixed font scaling and point scaling so circles, squares, etc on lines will scale with DPI as will fonts. Font scaling is not fully implemented on the gtk backend because I have not figured out how to scale fonts to arbitrary sizes with GTK

  - 2003-09-17  
    Fixed figure text bug which crashed X windows on long figure text extending beyond display area. This was, I believe, due to the vestigial erase functionality that was no longer needed since I began rendering to a pixmap

  - 2003-09-30  
    Added legend

  - 2003-10-01  
    Fixed bug when colors are specified with rgb tuple or hex string.

  - 2003-10-21  
    Andrew Straw provided some legend code which I modified and incorporated. Thanks Andrew\!

  - 2003-10-27  
    Fixed a bug in axis.get\_view\_distance that affected zoom in versus out with interactive scrolling, and a bug in the axis text reset system that prevented the text from being redrawn on a interactive gtk view lim set with the widget
    
    Fixed a bug in that prevented the manual setting of ticklabel strings from working properly

  - 2003-11-02
    
      - Do a nearest neighbor color pick on GD when allocate fails

      - Artist now know bounding box and dpi
      - Bounding boxes and transforms handled by dedicated classes
      - legend in dedicated class. Does a better job of alignment and bordering. Can be initialized with specific line instances. See examples/legend\_demo2.py

  - 2003-11-14  
    Fixed legend positioning bug and added new position args

  - 2003-11-16  
    Finished porting GD to new axes API

  - 2003-11-20
    
      - add TM for matlab on website and in docs

      - make a nice errorbar and scatter screenshot

  - 2003-11-20

# Changes to the default style

The most important changes in matplotlib 2.0 are the changes to the default style.

While it is impossible to select the best default for all cases, these are designed to work well in the most common cases.

A 'classic' style sheet is provided so reverting to the 1.x default values is a single line of python

`` `python   import matplotlib.style   import matplotlib as mpl   mpl.style.use('classic')  See [customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files](#customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files) for details about how to ``\` persistently and selectively revert many of these changes.

## Colors, color cycles, and colormaps

### Colors in default property cycle

The colors in the default property cycle have been changed from `['b', 'g', 'r', 'c', 'm', 'y', 'k']` to the category10 color palette used by [Vega](https://github.com/vega/vega/wiki/Scales#scale-range-literals) and [d3](https://github.com/d3/d3-3.x-api-reference/blob/master/Ordinal-Scales.md#category10) originally developed at Tableau.

</div>

In addition to changing the colors, an additional method to specify colors was added. Previously, the default colors were the single character short-hand notations for red, green, blue, cyan, magenta, yellow, and black. This made them easy to type and usable in the abbreviated style string in `plot`, however the new default colors are only specified via hex values. To access these colors outside of the property cycling the notation for colors `'CN'`, where `N` takes values 0-9, was added to denote the first 10 colors in `axes.prop_cycle`. See \[colors\_def\](\#colors\_def) for more details.

To restore the old color cycle use

`` `python    from cycler import cycler    mpl.rcParams['axes.prop_cycle'] = cycler(color='bgrcmyk')  or set  .. code-block:: cfg     axes.prop_cycle    : cycler('color', 'bgrcmyk')  in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file.   Colormap ``\` --------

The new default colormap used by <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.cm.ScalarMappable</span> instances is 'viridis' (aka [option D](https://bids.github.io/colormap/)).

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

N = M = 200 X, Y = np.ogrid\[0:20:N\*1j, 0:20:M\*1j\] data = np.sin(np.pi \* X\*2 / 20) \* np.cos(np.pi \* Y\*2 / 20)

fig, (ax2, ax1) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(7, 3)) im = ax1.imshow(data, extent=\[0, 200, 0, 200\]) ax1.set\_title("v2.0: 'viridis'") fig.colorbar(im, ax=ax1, shrink=0.8)

im2 = ax2.imshow(data, extent=\[0, 200, 0, 200\], cmap='jet') fig.colorbar(im2, ax=ax2, shrink=0.8) ax2.set\_title("classic: 'jet'")

fig.tight\_layout()

</div>

For an introduction to color theory and how 'viridis' was generated watch Nathaniel Smith and Stéfan van der Walt's talk from SciPy2015. See [here for many more details](https://bids.github.io/colormap/) about the other alternatives and the tools used to create the color map. For details on all of the colormaps available in matplotlib see \[colormaps\](\#colormaps).

<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xAoljeRJ3lU" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The previous default can be restored using

`` `python    mpl.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'jet'  or setting  .. code-block:: cfg     image.cmap    : 'jet'  in your :file:`matplotlibrc` file; however this is strongly discouraged.  Interactive figures ``\` -------------------

The default interactive figure background color has changed from grey to white, which matches the default background color used when saving.

The previous defaults can be restored by :

    mpl.rcParams['figure.facecolor'] = '0.75'

or by setting :

    figure.facecolor : '0.75'

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### Grid lines

The default style of grid lines was changed from black dashed lines to thicker solid light grey lines.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3))

ax1.grid(color='k', linewidth=.5, linestyle=':') ax1.set\_title('classic')

ax2.grid() ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

</div>

The previous default can be restored by using:

    mpl.rcParams['grid.color'] = 'k'
    mpl.rcParams['grid.linestyle'] = ':'
    mpl.rcParams['grid.linewidth'] = 0.5

or by setting:

    grid.color       :   k       # grid color
    grid.linestyle   :   :       # dotted
    grid.linewidth   :   0.5     # in points

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

## Figure size, font size, and screen dpi

The default dpi used for on-screen display was changed from 80 dpi to 100 dpi, the same as the default dpi for saving files. Due to this change, the on-screen display is now more what-you-see-is-what-you-get for saved files. To keep the figure the same size in terms of pixels, in order to maintain approximately the same size on the screen, the default figure size was reduced from 8x6 inches to 6.4x4.8 inches. As a consequence of this the default font sizes used for the title, tick labels, and axes labels were reduced to maintain their size relative to the overall size of the figure. By default the dpi of the saved image is now the dpi of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure</span> instance being saved.

This will have consequences if you are trying to match text in a figure directly with external text.

The previous defaults can be restored by :

    mpl.rcParams['figure.figsize'] = [8.0, 6.0]
    mpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = 80
    mpl.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = 100
    
    mpl.rcParams['font.size'] = 12
    mpl.rcParams['legend.fontsize'] = 'large'
    mpl.rcParams['figure.titlesize'] = 'medium'

or by setting:

    figure.figsize   : [8.0, 6.0]
    figure.dpi       : 80
    savefig.dpi      : 100
    
    font.size        : 12.0
    legend.fontsize  : 'large'
    figure.titlesize : 'medium'

In your `matplotlibrc` file.

In addition, the `forward` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.set\_size\_inches</span> now defaults to <span class="title-ref">True</span> to improve the interactive experience. Backend canvases that adjust the size of their bound <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.figure.Figure</span> must pass `forward=False` to avoid circular behavior. This default is not configurable.

## Plotting functions

### `scatter`

The following changes were made to the default behavior of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter</span>

  - The default size of the elements in a scatter plot is now based on `lines.markersize` so it is consistent with `plot(X, Y, 'o')`. The old value was 20, and the new value is 36 (6^2).
  - Scatter markers no longer have a black edge.
  - If the color of the markers is not specified it will follow the property cycle, pulling from the 'patches' cycle on the `Axes`.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(2)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3))

x = np.arange(15) y = np.random.rand(15) y2 = np.random.rand(15) ax1.scatter(x, y, s=20, edgecolors='k', c='b', label='a') ax1.scatter(x, y2, s=20, edgecolors='k', c='b', label='b') ax1.legend() ax1.set\_title('classic')

ax2.scatter(x, y, label='a') ax2.scatter(x, y2, label='b') ax2.legend() ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

</div>

The classic default behavior of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.scatter</span> can only be recovered through `mpl.style.use('classic')`. The marker size can be recovered via :

    mpl.rcParam['lines.markersize'] = np.sqrt(20)

however, this will also affect the default marker size of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>. To recover the classic behavior on a per-call basis pass the following kwargs:

    classic_kwargs = {'s': 20, 'edgecolors': 'k', 'c': 'b'}

### `plot`

The following changes were made to the default behavior of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>

  - the default linewidth increased from 1 to 1.5
  - the dash patterns associated with `'--'`, `':'`, and `'-.'` have changed
  - the dash patterns now scale with line width

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl from cycler import cycler

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3))

N = 15

x = np.arange(N) y = np.ones\_like(x)

  - sty\_cycle = (cycler('ls', \['--' ,':', '-.'\]) \*  
    cycler('lw', \[None, 1, 2, 5\]))

  - classic = {  
    'lines.linewidth': 1.0, 'lines.dashed\_pattern' : \[6, 6\], 'lines.dashdot\_pattern' : \[3, 5, 1, 5\], 'lines.dotted\_pattern' : \[1, 3\], 'lines.scale\_dashes': False}

v2 = {} \# {'lines.linewidth': 1.5, \# 'lines.dashed\_pattern' : \[2.8, 1.2\], \# 'lines.dashdot\_pattern' : \[4.8, 1.2, 0.8, 1.2\], \# 'lines.dotted\_pattern' : \[1.1, 1.1\], \# 'lines.scale\_dashes': True}

  - def demo(ax, rcparams, title):  
    ax.axis('off') ax.set\_title(title) with mpl.rc\_context(rc=rcparams): for j, sty in enumerate(sty\_cycle): ax.plot(x, y + j, \*\*sty)

demo(ax1, classic, 'classic') demo(ax2, {}, 'v2.0')

</div>

The previous defaults can be restored by setting:

    mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] = 1.0
    mpl.rcParams['lines.dashed_pattern'] = [6, 6]
    mpl.rcParams['lines.dashdot_pattern'] = [3, 5, 1, 5]
    mpl.rcParams['lines.dotted_pattern'] = [1, 3]
    mpl.rcParams['lines.scale_dashes'] = False

or by setting:

    lines.linewidth   : 1.0
    lines.dashed_pattern : 6, 6
    lines.dashdot_pattern : 3, 5, 1, 5
    lines.dotted_pattern : 1, 3
    lines.scale_dashes: False

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### `errorbar`

By default, caps on the ends of errorbars are not present.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

\# example data x = np.arange(0.1, 4, 0.5) y = np.exp(-x)

\# example variable error bar values yerr = 0.1 + 0.2\*np.sqrt(x) xerr = 0.1 + yerr

  - def demo(ax, rc, title):
    
      - with mpl.rc\_context(rc=rc):  
        ax.errorbar(x, y, xerr=0.2, yerr=0.4)
    
    ax.set\_title(title)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3), tight\_layout=True)

demo(ax1, {'errorbar.capsize': 3}, 'classic') demo(ax2, {}, 'v2.0')

</div>

This also changes the return value of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.errorbar</span> as the list of 'caplines' will be empty by default.

The previous defaults can be restored by setting:

    mpl.rcParams['errorbar.capsize'] = 3

or by setting :

    errorbar.capsize : 3

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### `boxplot`

Previously, boxplots were composed of a mish-mash of styles that were, for better for worse, inherited from Matlab. Most of the elements were blue, but the medians were red. The fliers (outliers) were black plus-symbols ('+') and the whiskers were dashed lines, which created ambiguity if the (solid and black) caps were not drawn.

For the new defaults, everything is black except for the median and mean lines (if drawn), which are set to the first two elements of the current color cycle. Also, the default flier markers are now hollow circles, which maintain the ability of the plus-symbols to overlap without obscuring data too much.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.random.lognormal(size=(37, 4)) fig, (old, new) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, sharey=True) with plt.style.context('default'): new.boxplot(data, labels=\['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'\]) new.set\_title('v2.0')

  - with plt.style.context('classic'):  
    old.boxplot(data, labels=\['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'\]) old.set\_title('classic')

new.set\_yscale('log') old.set\_yscale('log')

</div>

The previous defaults can be restored by setting:

    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.color'] = 'k'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker'] = '+'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.markerfacecolor'] = 'none'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.markeredgecolor'] = 'k'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.boxprops.color'] = 'b'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.whiskerprops.color'] = 'b'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.whiskerprops.linestyle'] = '--'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.medianprops.color'] = 'r'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.color'] = 'r'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.marker'] = '^'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.markerfacecolor'] = 'r'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.markeredgecolor'] = 'k'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.markersize'] = 6
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.linestyle'] = '--'
    mpl.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.linewidth'] = 1.0

or by setting:

    boxplot.flierprops.color:           'k'
    boxplot.flierprops.marker:          '+'
    boxplot.flierprops.markerfacecolor: 'none'
    boxplot.flierprops.markeredgecolor: 'k'
    boxplot.boxprops.color:             'b'
    boxplot.whiskerprops.color:         'b'
    boxplot.whiskerprops.linestyle:     '--'
    boxplot.medianprops.color:          'r'
    boxplot.meanprops.color:            'r'
    boxplot.meanprops.marker:           '^'
    boxplot.meanprops.markerfacecolor:  'r'
    boxplot.meanprops.markeredgecolor:  'k'
    boxplot.meanprops.markersize:        6
    boxplot.meanprops.linestyle:         '--'
    boxplot.meanprops.linewidth:         1.0

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### `fill_between` and `fill_betweenx`

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill\_between</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill\_betweenx</span> both follow the patch color cycle.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3)) fig.subplots\_adjust(wspace=0.3) th = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 128) N = 5

  - def demo(ax, extra\_kwargs, title):  
    ax.set\_title(title) return \[ax.fill\_between(th, np.sin((j / N) \* np.pi + th), alpha=.5, \*\*extra\_kwargs) for j in range(N)\]

demo(ax1, {'facecolor': 'C0'}, 'classic') demo(ax2, {}, 'v2.0')

</div>

If the facecolor is set via the `facecolors` or `color` keyword argument, then the color is not cycled.

To restore the previous behavior, explicitly pass the keyword argument `facecolors='C0'` to the method call.

### Patch edges and color

Most artists drawn with a patch (`~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar`, `~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pie`, etc) no longer have a black edge by default. The default face color is now `'C0'` instead of `'b'`.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from matplotlib import rc\_context import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

fig, all\_ax = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(4, 6), tight\_layout=True)

  - def demo(ax\_top, ax\_mid, ax\_bottom, rcparams, label):  
    labels = 'Frogs', 'Hogs', 'Dogs', 'Logs' fracs = \[15, 30, 45, 10\]
    
    explode = (0, 0.05, 0, 0)
    
    ax\_top.set\_title(label)
    
      - with rc\_context(rc=rcparams):  
        ax\_top.pie(fracs, labels=labels) ax\_top.set\_aspect('equal') ax\_mid.bar(range(len(fracs)), fracs, tick\_label=labels) plt.setp(ax\_mid.get\_xticklabels(), rotation=-45) grid = np.mgrid\[0.2:0.8:3j, 0.2:0.8:3j\].reshape(2, -1).T
        
        ax\_bottom.set\_xlim(0, .75) ax\_bottom.set\_ylim(0, .75) ax\_bottom.add\_artist(mpatches.Rectangle(grid\[1\] - \[0.025, 0.05\], 0.05, 0.1)) ax\_bottom.add\_artist(mpatches.RegularPolygon(grid\[3\], 5, radius=0.1)) ax\_bottom.add\_artist(mpatches.Ellipse(grid\[4\], 0.2, 0.1)) ax\_bottom.add\_artist(mpatches.Circle(grid\[0\], 0.1)) ax\_bottom.axis('off')

demo(*all\_ax\[:, 0\], rcparams={'patch.force\_edgecolor': True, 'patch.facecolor': 'b'}, label='classic') demo(*all\_ax\[:, 1\], rcparams={}, label='v2.0')

</div>

The previous defaults can be restored by setting:

    mpl.rcParams['patch.force_edgecolor'] = True
    mpl.rcParams['patch.facecolor'] = 'b'

or by setting:

    patch.facecolor        : b
    patch.force_edgecolor  : True

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### `hexbin`

The default value of the *linecolor* keyword argument for <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.hexbin</span> has changed from `'none'` to `'face'`. If 'none' is now supplied, no line edges are drawn around the hexagons.

### `bar` and `barh`

The default value of the `align` kwarg for both <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.barh</span> is changed from `'edge'` to `'center'`.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ((ax1, ax2), (ax3, ax4)) = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 5))

  - def demo(bar\_func, bar\_kwargs):
    
      - return bar\_func(\[1, 2, 3\], \[1, 2, 3\], tick\_label=\['a', 'b', 'c'\],  
        \*\*bar\_kwargs)

ax1.set\_title("classic") ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

demo(ax1.bar, {'align': 'edge'}) demo(ax2.bar, {}) demo(ax3.barh, {'align': 'edge'}) demo(ax4.barh, {})

</div>

To restore the previous behavior explicitly pass the keyword argument `align='edge'` to the method call.

## Hatching

The color of the lines in the hatch is now determined by

  - If an edge color is explicitly set, use that for the hatch color
  - If the edge color is not explicitly set, use `hatch.color` which is looked up at artist creation time.

The width of the lines in a hatch pattern is now configurable by the rcParams `hatch.linewidth`, which defaults to 1 point. The old behavior for the line width was different depending on backend:

  - PDF: 0.1 pt
  - SVG: 1.0 pt
  - PS: 1 px
  - Agg: 1 px

The old line width behavior cannot be restored across all backends simultaneously, but can be restored for a single backend by setting:

    mpl.rcParams['hatch.linewidth'] = 0.1  # previous pdf hatch linewidth
    mpl.rcParams['hatch.linewidth'] = 1.0  # previous svg hatch linewidth

The behavior of the PS and Agg backends was DPI dependent, thus:

    mpl.rcParams['figure.dpi'] = dpi
    mpl.rcParams['savefig.dpi'] = dpi  # or leave as default 'figure'
    mpl.rcParams['hatch.linewidth'] = 1.0 / dpi  # previous ps and Agg hatch linewidth

There is no direct API level control of the hatch color or linewidth.

Hatching patterns are now rendered at a consistent density, regardless of DPI. Formerly, high DPI figures would be more dense than the default, and low DPI figures would be less dense. This old behavior cannot be directly restored, but the density may be increased by repeating the hatch specifier.

## Fonts

### Normal text

The default font has changed from "Bitstream Vera Sans" to "DejaVu Sans". DejaVu Sans has additional international and math characters, but otherwise has the same appearance as Bitstream Vera Sans. Latin, Greek, Cyrillic, Armenian, Georgian, Hebrew, and Arabic are [all supported](https://dejavu-fonts.github.io/) (but right-to-left rendering is still not handled by matplotlib). In addition, DejaVu contains a sub-set of emoji symbols.

<div class="plot">

from \_\_future\_\_ import unicode\_literals

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots() tick\_labels = \['😃', '😎', '😴', '😲', '😻'\] bar\_labels = \['א', 'α', '☣', '⌬', 'ℝ'\] y = \[1, 4, 9, 16, 25\] x = range(5) ax.bar(x, y, tick\_label=tick\_labels, align='center') ax.xaxis.set\_tick\_params(labelsize=20) for \_x, \_y, t in zip(x, y, bar\_labels): ax.annotate(t, (\_x, \_y), fontsize=20, ha='center', xytext=(0, -2), textcoords='offset pixels', bbox={'facecolor': 'w'})

ax.set\_title('Диаграмма со смайликами')

</div>

See the [DejaVu Sans PDF sample for full coverage](http://dejavu.sourceforge.net/samples/DejaVuSans.pdf).

### Math text

The default math font when using the built-in math rendering engine (mathtext) has changed from "Computer Modern" (i.e. LaTeX-like) to "DejaVu Sans". This change has no effect if the TeX backend is used (i.e. `text.usetex` is `True`).

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl

mpl.rcParams\['mathtext.fontset'\] = 'cm' mpl.rcParams\['mathtext.rm'\] = 'serif'

fig, ax = plt.subplots(tight\_layout=True, figsize=(3, 3))

ax.plot(range(15), label=r'int: $15 int\_0^infty dx$') ax.legend() ax.set\_title('classic')

</div>

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl

fig, ax = plt.subplots(tight\_layout=True, figsize=(3, 3))

ax.plot(range(15), label=r'int: $15 int\_0^infty dx$') ax.legend() ax.set\_title('v2.0')

</div>

To revert to the old behavior set the:

    mpl.rcParams['mathtext.fontset'] = 'cm'
    mpl.rcParams['mathtext.rm'] = 'serif'

or set:

    mathtext.fontset: cm
    mathtext.rm : serif

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

This `rcParam` is consulted when the text is drawn, not when the artist is created. Thus all mathtext on a given `canvas` will use the same fontset.

## Legends

  - By default, the number of points displayed in a legend is now 1.
  - The default legend location is `'best'`, so the legend will be automatically placed in a location to minimize overlap with data.
  - The legend defaults now include rounded corners, a lighter boundary, and partially transparent boundary and background.

<div class="plot">

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

## Image

### Interpolation

The default interpolation method for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.imshow</span> is now `'nearest'` and by default it resamples the data (both up and down sampling) before colormapping.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib as mpl import numpy as np

  - def demo(ax, rcparams, title):  
    np.random.seed(2) A = np.random.rand(5, 5)
    
      - with mpl.rc\_context(rc=rcparams):  
        ax.imshow(A) ax.set\_title(title)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6, 3), tight\_layout=True)

  - classic\_rcparams = {'image.interpolation': 'bilinear',  
    'image.resample': False}

demo(ax1, classic\_rcparams, 'classic') demo(ax2, {}, 'v2.0')

</div>

To restore the previous behavior set:

    mpl.rcParams['image.interpolation'] = 'bilinear'
    mpl.rcParams['image.resample'] = False

or set:

    image.interpolation  : bilinear  # see help(imshow) for options
    image.resample  : False

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### Colormapping pipeline

Previously, the input data was normalized, then colormapped, and then resampled to the resolution required for the screen. This meant that the final resampling was being done in color space. Because the color maps are not generally linear in RGB space, colors not in the colormap may appear in the final image. This bug was addressed by an almost complete overhaul of the image handling code.

The input data is now normalized, then resampled to the correct resolution (in normalized dataspace), and then colormapped to RGB space. This ensures that only colors from the colormap appear in the final image. (If your viewer subsequently resamples the image, the artifact may reappear.)

The previous behavior cannot be restored.

### Shading

  - The default shading mode for light source shading, in `matplotlib.colors.LightSource.shade`, is now `overlay`. Formerly, it was `hsv`.

## Plot layout

### Auto limits

The previous auto-scaling behavior was to find 'nice' round numbers as view limits that enclosed the data limits, but this could produce bad plots if the data happened to fall on a vertical or horizontal line near the chosen 'round number' limit. The new default sets the view limits to 5% wider than the data range.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy

data = np.zeros(1000) data\[0\] = 1

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3))

  - def demo(fig, rc, title, j):
    
      - with mpl.rc\_context(rc=rc):  
        ax = fig.add\_subplot(1, 2, j) ax.plot(data) ax.set\_title(title)

  - demo(fig, {'axes.autolimit\_mode': 'round\_numbers',  
    'axes.xmargin': 0, 'axes.ymargin': 0}, 'classic', 1)

demo(fig, {}, 'v2.0', 2)

</div>

The size of the padding in the x and y directions is controlled by the `'axes.xmargin'` and `'axes.ymargin'` rcParams respectively. Whether the view limits should be 'round numbers' is controlled by `axes.autolimit_mode`. In the original `'round_number'` mode, the view limits coincide with ticks.

The previous default can be restored by using:

    mpl.rcParams['axes.autolimit_mode'] = 'round_numbers'
    mpl.rcParams['axes.xmargin'] = 0
    mpl.rcParams['axes.ymargin'] = 0

or setting:

    axes.autolimit_mode: round_numbers
    axes.xmargin: 0
    axes.ymargin: 0

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

### Z-order

  - Ticks and grids are now plotted above solid elements such as filled contours, but below lines. To return to the previous behavior of plotting ticks and grids above lines, set `rcParams['axes.axisbelow'] = False`.

### Ticks

#### Direction

To reduce the collision of tick marks with data, the default ticks now point outward by default. In addition, ticks are now drawn only on the bottom and left spines to prevent a porcupine appearance, and for a cleaner separation between subplots.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib as mpl import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

th = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 128) y = np.sin(th)

  - def demo(fig, rcparams, title, j):  
    np.random.seed(2) with mpl.rc\_context(rc=rcparams):
    
    > ax = fig.add\_subplot(2, 2, j) ax.hist(np.random.beta(0.5, 0.5, 10000), 25, density=True) ax.set\_xlim(\[0, 1\]) ax.set\_title(title)
    > 
    > ax = fig.add\_subplot(2, 2, j + 2) ax.imshow(np.random.rand(5, 5))

  - classic = {'xtick.direction': 'in',  
    'ytick.direction': 'in', 'xtick.top': True, 'ytick.right': True}

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 6), tight\_layout=True)

demo(fig, classic, 'classic', 1) demo(fig, {}, 'v2.0', 2)

</div>

To restore the previous behavior set:

    mpl.rcParams['xtick.direction'] = 'in'
    mpl.rcParams['ytick.direction'] = 'in'
    mpl.rcParams['xtick.top'] = True
    mpl.rcParams['ytick.right'] = True

or set:

    xtick.top: True
    xtick.direction: in
    
    ytick.right: True
    ytick.direction: in

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

#### Number of ticks

The default <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator</span> used for the x and y axis is <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.AutoLocator</span> which tries to find, up to some maximum number, 'nicely' spaced ticks. The locator now includes an algorithm to estimate the maximum number of ticks that will leave room for the tick labels. By default it also ensures that there are at least two ticks visible.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

from matplotlib.ticker import AutoLocator

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(4, 3), tight\_layout=True) ax1.set\_xlim(0, .1) ax2.set\_xlim(0, .1)

ax1.xaxis.get\_major\_locator().set\_params(nbins=9, steps=\[1, 2, 5, 10\]) ax1.set\_title('classic') ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

</div>

There is no way, other than using `mpl.style.use('classic')`, to restore the previous behavior as the default. On an axis-by-axis basis you may either control the existing locator via: :

    ax.xaxis.get_major_locator().set_params(nbins=9, steps=[1, 2, 5, 10])

or create a new \`\~matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator\`:

    import matplotlib.ticker as mticker
    ax.set_major_locator(mticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=9, steps=[1, 2, 5, 10])

The algorithm used by <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.MaxNLocator</span> has been improved, and this may change the choice of tick locations in some cases. This also affects <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.AutoLocator</span>, which uses `MaxNLocator` internally.

For a log-scaled axis the default locator is the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.LogLocator</span>. Previously the maximum number of ticks was set to 15, and could not be changed. Now there is a *numticks* kwarg for setting the maximum to any integer value, to the string 'auto', or to its default value of None which is equivalent to 'auto'. With the 'auto' setting the maximum number will be no larger than 9, and will be reduced depending on the length of the axis in units of the tick font size. As in the case of the AutoLocator, the heuristic algorithm reduces the incidence of overlapping tick labels but does not prevent it.

### Tick label formatting

#### `LogFormatter` labeling of minor ticks

Minor ticks on a log axis are now labeled when the axis view limits span a range less than or equal to the interval between two major ticks. See <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.LogFormatter</span> for details. The minor tick labeling is turned off when using `mpl.style.use('classic')`, but cannot be controlled independently via <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span>.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(2)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(6, 3)) fig.subplots\_adjust(wspace=0.35, left=0.09, right=0.95)

x = np.linspace(0.9, 1.7, 10) y = 10 \*\* x\[np.random.randint(0, 10, 10)\]

ax2.semilogy(x, y) ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

  - with plt.style.context('classic'):  
    ax1.semilogy(x, y) ax1.set\_xlim(ax2.get\_xlim()) ax1.set\_ylim(ax2.get\_ylim()) ax1.set\_title('classic')

</div>

#### `ScalarFormatter` tick label formatting with offsets

With the default `axes.formatter.useoffset`, an offset will be used when it will save 4 or more digits. This can be controlled with the new `axes.formatter.offset_threshold`. To restore the previous behavior of using an offset to save 2 or more digits, use `rcParams['axes.formatter.offset_threshold'] = 2`.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

np.random.seed(5)

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(6, 3)) fig.subplots\_adjust(bottom=0.15, wspace=0.3, left=0.09, right=0.95)

x = np.linspace(2000, 2008, 9) y = np.random.randn(9) + 50000

  - with plt.rc\_context(rc={'axes.formatter.offset\_threshold' : 2}):  
    ax1 = fig.add\_subplot(1, 2, 1) ax1.plot(x, y) ax1.set\_title('classic')

ax2 = fig.add\_subplot(1, 2, 2) ax2.plot(x, y) ax2.set\_title('v2.0')

</div>

#### `AutoDateFormatter` format strings

The default date formats are now all based on ISO format, i.e., with the slowest-moving value first. The date formatters are configurable through the `date.autoformatter.*` rcParams.

| Threshold (tick interval \>= than) | rcParam                            | classic         | v2.0            |
| ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| 365 days                           | `'date.autoformatter.year'`        | `'%Y'`          | `'%Y'`          |
| 30 days                            | `'date.autoformatter.month'`       | `'%b %Y'`       | `'%Y-%m'`       |
| 1 day                              | `'date.autoformatter.day'`         | `'%b %d %Y'`    | `'%Y-%m-%d'`    |
| 1 hour                             | `'date.autoformatter.hour'`        | `'%H:%M:%S'`    | `'%H:%M'`       |
| 1 minute                           | `'date.autoformatter.minute'`      | `'%H:%M:%S.%f'` | `'%H:%M:%S'`    |
| 1 second                           | `'date.autoformatter.second'`      | `'%H:%M:%S.%f'` | `'%H:%M:%S'`    |
| 1 microsecond                      | `'date.autoformatter.microsecond'` | `'%H:%M:%S.%f'` | `'%H:%M:%S.%f'` |

Python's `%x` and `%X` date formats may be of particular interest to format dates based on the current locale.

The previous default can be restored by:

    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.year'] = '%Y'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.month'] = '%b %Y'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.day'] = '%b %d %Y'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.hour'] = '%H:%M:%S'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.minute'] = '%H:%M:%S.%f'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.second'] = '%H:%M:%S.%f'
    mpl.rcParams['date.autoformatter.microsecond'] = '%H:%M:%S.%f'

or setting :

    date.autoformatter.year   : %Y
    date.autoformatter.month  : %b %Y
    date.autoformatter.day    : %b %d %Y
    date.autoformatter.hour   : %H:%M:%S
    date.autoformatter.minute : %H:%M:%S.%f
    date.autoformatter.second : %H:%M:%S.%f
    date.autoformatter.microsecond : %H:%M:%S.%f

in your `matplotlibrc` file.

## mplot3d

  - mplot3d now obeys some style-related rcParams, rather than using hard-coded defaults. These include:
      - xtick.major.width
      - ytick.major.width
      - xtick.color
      - ytick.color
      - axes.linewidth
      - axes.edgecolor
      - grid.color
      - grid.linewidth
      - grid.linestyle

# What's new in Matplotlib 0.98.4

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

It's been four months since the last matplotlib release, and there are a lot of new features and bug-fixes.

Thanks to Charlie Moad for testing and preparing the source release, including binaries for OS X and Windows for python 2.4 and 2.5 (2.6 and 3.0 will not be available until numpy is available on those releases). Thanks to the many developers who contributed to this release, with contributions from Jae-Joon Lee, Michael Droettboom, Ryan May, Eric Firing, Manuel Metz, Jouni K. Seppänen, Jeff Whitaker, Darren Dale, David Kaplan, Michiel de Hoon and many others who submitted patches

## Legend enhancements

Jae-Joon has rewritten the legend class, and added support for multiple columns and rows, as well as fancy box drawing. See <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.legend.Legend</span>.

<div class="plot">

ax = plt.subplot() t1 = np.arange(0.0, 1.0, 0.01) for n in \[1, 2, 3, 4\]: plt.plot(t1, t1\*\*n, label=f"n={n}")

leg = plt.legend(loc='best', ncol=2, mode="expand", shadow=True, fancybox=True) leg.get\_frame().set\_alpha(0.5)

plt.show()

</div>

## Fancy annotations and arrows

Jae-Joon has added lots of support to annotations for drawing fancy boxes and connectors in annotations. See <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.annotate</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.BoxStyle</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.ArrowStyle</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.ConnectionStyle</span>.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.patches as mpatch import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

figheight = 4 fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4.5, figheight), dpi=80) fontsize = 0.2 \* fig.dpi

  - def make\_boxstyles(ax):  
    styles = mpatch.BoxStyle.get\_styles()
    
      - for i, (stylename, styleclass) in enumerate(sorted(styles.items())):
        
          - ax.text(0.5, (float(len(styles)) - 0.5 - i)/len(styles), stylename,  
            ha="center", size=fontsize, transform=ax.transAxes, bbox=dict(boxstyle=stylename, fc="w", ec="k"))

  - def make\_arrowstyles(ax):  
    styles = mpatch.ArrowStyle.get\_styles()
    
    ax.set\_xlim(0, 4) ax.set\_ylim(0, figheight\*2)
    
      - for i, (stylename, styleclass) in enumerate(sorted(styles.items())):  
        y = (float(len(styles)) - 0.25 - i) \# /figheight p = mpatch.Circle((3.2, y), 0.2, fc="w") ax.add\_patch(p)
        
          - ax.annotate(stylename, (3.2, y),  
            (2., y), \# xycoords="figure fraction", textcoords="figure fraction", ha="right", va="center", size=fontsize, arrowprops=dict(arrowstyle=stylename, patchB=p, shrinkA=5, shrinkB=5, fc="w", ec="k", connectionstyle="arc3,rad=-0.05", ), bbox=dict(boxstyle="square", fc="w"))
    
    ax.xaxis.set\_visible(False) ax.yaxis.set\_visible(False)

ax1 = fig.add\_subplot(121, frameon=False, xticks=\[\], yticks=\[\]) make\_boxstyles(ax1)

ax2 = fig.add\_subplot(122, frameon=False, xticks=\[\], yticks=\[\]) make\_arrowstyles(ax2)

plt.show()

</div>

## Native OS X backend

Michiel de Hoon has provided a native Mac OSX backend that is almost completely implemented in C. The backend can therefore use Quartz directly and, depending on the application, can be orders of magnitude faster than the existing backends. In addition, no third-party libraries are needed other than Python and NumPy. The backend is interactive from the usual terminal application on Mac using regular Python. It hasn't been tested with ipython yet, but in principle it should to work there as well. Set 'backend : macosx' in your matplotlibrc file, or run your script with:

    > python myfile.py -dmacosx

## psd amplitude scaling

Ryan May did a lot of work to rationalize the amplitude scaling of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.psd</span> and friends. See \[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/psd\_demo\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/psd\_demo.md). The changes should increase MATLAB compatibility and increase scaling options.

## Fill between

Added a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.fill\_between</span> function to make it easier to do shaded region plots in the presence of masked data. You can pass an *x* array and a *ylower* and *yupper* array to fill between, and an optional *where* argument which is a logical mask where you want to do the filling.

<div class="plot">

x = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.01) y1 = -5\*x\*x + x + 10 y2 = 5\*x\*x + x

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y1, x, y2, color='black') ax.fill\_between(x, y1, y2, where=(y2 \> y1), facecolor='yellow', alpha=0.5) ax.fill\_between(x, y1, y2, where=(y2 \<= y1), facecolor='red', alpha=0.5) ax.set\_title('Fill Between')

plt.show()

</div>

## Lots more

Here are the 0.98.4 notes from the CHANGELOG:

    Added mdehoon's native macosx backend from sf patch 2179017 - JDH
    
    Removed the prints in the set_*style commands.  Return the list of
    pretty-printed strings instead - JDH
    
    Some of the changes Michael made to improve the output of the
    property tables in the rest docs broke of made difficult to use
    some of the interactive doc helpers, e.g., setp and getp.  Having all
    the rest markup in the ipython shell also confused the docstrings.
    I added a new rc param docstring.harcopy, to format the docstrings
    differently for hardcopy and other use.  The ArtistInspector
    could use a little refactoring now since there is duplication of
    effort between the rest out put and the non-rest output - JDH
    
    Updated spectral methods (psd, csd, etc.) to scale one-sided
    densities by a factor of 2 and, optionally, scale all densities by
    the sampling frequency.  This gives better MATLAB
    compatibility. -RM
    
    Fixed alignment of ticks in colorbars. -MGD
    
    drop the deprecated "new" keyword of np.histogram() for numpy 1.2
    or later.  -JJL
    
    Fixed a bug in svg backend that new_figure_manager() ignores
    keywords arguments such as figsize, etc. -JJL
    
    Fixed a bug that the handlelength of the new legend class set too
    short when numpoints=1 -JJL
    
    Added support for data with units (e.g., dates) to
    Axes.fill_between. -RM
    
    Added fancybox keyword to legend. Also applied some changes for
    better look, including baseline adjustment of the multiline texts
    so that it is center aligned. -JJL
    
    The transmuter classes in the patches.py are reorganized as
    subclasses of the Style classes. A few more box and arrow styles
    are added. -JJL
    
    Fixed a bug in the new legend class that didn't allowed a tuple of
    coordinate values as loc. -JJL
    
    Improve checks for external dependencies, using subprocess
    (instead of deprecated popen*) and distutils (for version
    checking) - DSD
    
    Reimplementation of the legend which supports baseline alignment,
    multi-column, and expand mode. - JJL
    
    Fixed histogram autoscaling bug when bins or range are given
    explicitly (fixes Debian bug 503148) - MM
    
    Added rcParam axes.unicode_minus which allows plain hyphen for
    minus when False - JDH
    
    Added scatterpoints support in Legend. patch by Erik Tollerud -
    JJL
    
    Fix crash in log ticking. - MGD
    
    Added static helper method BrokenHBarCollection.span_where and
    Axes/pyplot method fill_between.  See
    examples/pylab/fill_between.py - JDH
    
    Add x_isdata and y_isdata attributes to Artist instances, and use
    them to determine whether either or both coordinates are used when
    updating dataLim.  This is used to fix autoscaling problems that
    had been triggered by axhline, axhspan, axvline, axvspan. - EF
    
    Update the psd(), csd(), cohere(), and specgram() methods of Axes
    and the csd() cohere(), and specgram() functions in mlab to be in
    sync with the changes to psd().  In fact, under the hood, these
    all call the same core to do computations. - RM
    
    Add 'pad_to' and 'sides' parameters to mlab.psd() to allow
    controlling of zero padding and returning of negative frequency
    components, respectively.  These are added in a way that does not
    change the API. - RM
    
    Fix handling of c kwarg by scatter; generalize is_string_like to
    accept numpy and numpy.ma string array scalars. - RM and EF
    
    Fix a possible EINTR problem in dviread, which might help when
    saving pdf files from the qt backend. - JKS
    
    Fix bug with zoom to rectangle and twin axes - MGD
    
    Added Jae Joon's fancy arrow, box and annotation enhancements --
    see examples/pylab_examples/annotation_demo2.py
    
    Autoscaling is now supported with shared axes - EF
    
    Fixed exception in dviread that happened with Minion - JKS
    
    set_xlim, ylim now return a copy of the viewlim array to avoid
    modify inplace surprises
    
    Added image thumbnail generating function
    matplotlib.image.thumbnail.  See examples/misc/image_thumbnail.py
    - JDH
    
    Applied scatleg patch based on ideas and work by Erik Tollerud and
    Jae-Joon Lee. - MM
    
    Fixed bug in pdf backend: if you pass a file object for output
    instead of a filename, e.g., in a wep app, we now flush the object
    at the end. - JKS
    
    Add path simplification support to paths with gaps. - EF
    
    Fix problem with AFM files that don't specify the font's full name
    or family name. - JKS

    angles - EF
    
    Fix polar interpolation to handle negative values of theta - MGD
    
    Reorganized cbook and mlab methods related to numerical
    calculations that have little to do with the goals of those two

# What's new in Matplotlib 0.99 (Aug 29, 2009)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

## New documentation

Jae-Joon Lee has written two new guides \[legend\_guide\](\#legend\_guide) and \[plotting-guide-annotation\](\#plotting-guide-annotation). Michael Sarahan has written \[image\_tutorial\](\#image\_tutorial). John Hunter has written two new tutorials on working with paths and transformations: \[paths\](\#paths) and \[transforms\_tutorial\](\#transforms\_tutorial).

## mplot3d

Reinier Heeres has ported John Porter's mplot3d over to the new matplotlib transformations framework, and it is now available as a toolkit mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d (which now comes standard with all mpl installs). See \[mplot3d-examples-index\](\#mplot3d-examples-index) and \[mplot3d\](\#mplot3d).

<div class="plot">

from matplotlib import cm from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

plt.style.use('classic')

X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25) Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25) X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y) R = np.sqrt(X\**2 + Y*\*2) Z = np.sin(R)

fig = plt.figure() ax = Axes3D(fig, auto\_add\_to\_figure=False) fig.add\_axes(ax) ax.plot\_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1, cmap=cm.viridis)

plt.show()

</div>

## axes grid toolkit

Jae-Joon Lee has added a new toolkit to ease displaying multiple images in matplotlib, as well as some support for curvilinear grids to support the world coordinate system. The toolkit is included standard with all new mpl installs. See \[axes\_grid1-examples-index\](\#axes\_grid1-examples-index), \[axisartist-examples-index\](\#axisartist-examples-index), \[axes\_grid1\_users-guide-index\](\#axes\_grid1\_users-guide-index) and \[axisartist\_users-guide-index\](\#axisartist\_users-guide-index)

<div class="plot">

from mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_rgb import RGBAxes

  - def get\_demo\_image():  
    \# prepare image delta = 0.5
    
    extent = (-3, 4, -4, 3) x = np.arange(-3.0, 4.001, delta) y = np.arange(-4.0, 3.001, delta) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) Z1 = np.exp(-X\**2 - Y2) Z2 = np.exp(-(X - 1)2 - (Y - 1)2) Z = (Z1 - Z2)* 2

ax.RGB.set\_xlim(0., 9.5) ax.RGB.set\_ylim(0.9, 10.6)

plt.show()

</div>

## Axis spine placement

Andrew Straw has added the ability to place "axis spines" -- the lines that denote the data limits -- in various arbitrary locations. No longer are your axis lines constrained to be a simple rectangle around the figure -- you can turn on or off left, bottom, right and top, as well as "detach" the spine to offset it away from the data. See \[/gallery/spines/spine\_placement\_demo\](/gallery/spines/spine\_placement\_demo.md) and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.spines.Spine</span>.

<div class="plot">

  - def adjust\_spines(ax, spines):
    
      - for loc, spine in ax.spines.items():
        
          - if loc in spines:  
            spine.set\_position(('outward', 10)) \# outward by 10 points
        
          - else:  
            spine.set\_color('none') \# don't draw spine
    
    \# turn off ticks where there is no spine if 'left' in spines: ax.yaxis.set\_ticks\_position('left') else: \# no yaxis ticks ax.yaxis.set\_ticks(\[\])
    
      - if 'bottom' in spines:  
        ax.xaxis.set\_ticks\_position('bottom')
    
      - else:  
        \# no xaxis ticks ax.xaxis.set\_ticks(\[\])

fig = plt.figure()

plt.style.use('classic')

x = np.linspace(0, 2\*np.pi, 100) y = 2\*np.sin(x)

ax = fig.add\_subplot(2, 2, 1) ax.plot(x, y) adjust\_spines(ax, \['left'\])

ax = fig.add\_subplot(2, 2, 2) ax.plot(x, y) adjust\_spines(ax, \[\])

ax = fig.add\_subplot(2, 2, 3) ax.plot(x, y) adjust\_spines(ax, \['left', 'bottom'\])

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.0 (Jul 06, 2010)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

## HTML5/Canvas backend

Simon Ratcliffe and Ludwig Schwardt have released an [HTML5/Canvas](https://code.google.com/archive/p/mplh5canvas) backend for matplotlib. The backend is almost feature complete, and they have done a lot of work comparing their html5 rendered images with our core renderer Agg. The backend features client/server interactive navigation of matplotlib figures in an html5 compliant browser.

## Sophisticated subplot grid layout

Jae-Joon Lee has written `~matplotlib.gridspec`, a new module for doing complex subplot layouts, featuring row and column spans and more. See \[arranging\_axes\](\#arranging\_axes) for a tutorial overview.

![](../../gallery/userdemo/images/sphx_glr_demo_gridspec01_001.png)

## Easy pythonic subplots

Fernando Perez got tired of all the boilerplate code needed to create a figure and multiple subplots when using the matplotlib API, and wrote a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span> helper function. Basic usage allows you to create the figure and an array of subplots with numpy indexing (starts with 0). e.g.:

    fig, axarr = plt.subplots(2, 2)
    axarr[0,0].plot([1,2,3])   # upper, left

See \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/subplot\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/subplot.md) for several code examples.

## Contour fixes and triplot

Ian Thomas has fixed a long-standing bug that has vexed our most talented developers for years. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span> now handles interior masked regions, and the boundaries of line and filled contours coincide.

Additionally, he has contributed a new module `~matplotlib.tri` and helper function <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.triplot</span> for creating and plotting unstructured triangular grids.

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_triplot_demo_001.png)

## multiple calls to show supported

A long standing request is to support multiple calls to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.show</span>. This has been difficult because it is hard to get consistent behavior across operating systems, user interface toolkits and versions. Eric Firing has done a lot of work on rationalizing show across backends, with the desired behavior to make show raise all newly created figures and block execution until they are closed. Repeated calls to show should raise newly created figures since the last call. Eric has done a lot of testing on the user interface toolkits and versions and platforms he has access to, but it is not possible to test them all, so please report problems to the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/matplotlib-users) and [bug tracker](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues).

## mplot3d graphs can be embedded in arbitrary axes

You can now place an mplot3d graph into an arbitrary axes location, supporting mixing of 2D and 3D graphs in the same figure, and/or multiple 3D graphs in a single figure, using the "projection" keyword argument to add\_axes or add\_subplot. Thanks Ben Root.

<div class="plot">

from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d import get\_test\_data

fig = plt.figure()

X = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25) Y = np.arange(-5, 5, 0.25) X, Y = np.meshgrid(X, Y) R = np.sqrt(X\**2 + Y*\*2) Z = np.sin(R) ax = fig.add\_subplot(1, 2, 1, projection='3d') surf = ax.plot\_surface(X, Y, Z, rstride=1, cstride=1, cmap='viridis', linewidth=0, antialiased=False) ax.set\_zlim3d(-1.01, 1.01)

fig.colorbar(surf, shrink=0.5, aspect=5)

X, Y, Z = get\_test\_data(0.05) ax = fig.add\_subplot(1, 2, 2, projection='3d') ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=10)

plt.show()

</div>

## tick\_params

Eric Firing wrote tick\_params, a convenience method for changing the appearance of ticks and tick labels. See pyplot function <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.tick\_params</span> and associated Axes method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span>.

## Lots of performance and feature enhancements

  - Faster magnification of large images, and the ability to zoom in to a single pixel
  - Local installs of documentation work better
  - Improved "widgets" -- mouse grabbing is supported
  - More accurate snapping of lines to pixel boundaries
  - More consistent handling of color, particularly the alpha channel, throughout the API

## Much improved software carpentry

The matplotlib trunk is probably in as good a shape as it has ever been, thanks to improved [software carpentry](https://software-carpentry.org/). We now have a [buildbot](https://buildbot.net) which runs a suite of [nose](http://code.google.com/p/python-nose/) regression tests on every svn commit, auto-generating a set of images and comparing them against a set of known-goods, sending emails to developers on failures with a pixel-by-pixel image comparison. Releases and release bugfixes happen in branches, allowing active new feature development to happen in the trunk while keeping the release branches stable. Thanks to Andrew Straw, Michael Droettboom and other matplotlib developers for the heavy lifting.

## Bugfix marathon

Eric Firing went on a bug fixing and closing marathon, closing over 100 bugs on the (now-closed) SourceForge bug tracker with help from Jae-Joon Lee, Michael Droettboom, Christoph Gohlke and Michiel de Hoon.

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.1 (Nov 02, 2011)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

\> **Note** \> matplotlib 1.1 supports Python 2.4 to 2.7

## Sankey Diagrams

Kevin Davies has extended Yannick Copin's original Sankey example into a module (`~matplotlib.sankey`) and provided new examples (\[/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_basics\](/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_basics.md), \[/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_links\](/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_links.md), \[/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_rankine\](/gallery/specialty\_plots/sankey\_rankine.md)).

![](../../gallery/specialty_plots/images/sphx_glr_sankey_rankine_001.png)

## Animation

Ryan May has written a backend-independent framework for creating animated figures. The `~matplotlib.animation` module is intended to replace the backend-specific examples formerly in the \[examples-index\](\#examples-index) listings. Examples using the new framework are in \[animation-examples-index\](\#animation-examples-index); see the entrancing `double
pendulum <gallery/animation/double_pendulum_sgskip.py>` which uses <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.animation.Animation.save</span> to create the movie below.

<iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/32cjc6V0OZY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

This should be considered as a beta release of the framework; please try it and provide feedback.

## Tight Layout

A frequent issue raised by users of matplotlib is the lack of a layout engine to nicely space out elements of the plots. While matplotlib still adheres to the philosophy of giving users complete control over the placement of plot elements, Jae-Joon Lee created the `matplotlib.tight_layout` module and introduced a new command <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.tight\_layout</span> to address the most common layout issues.

<div class="plot">

plt.style.use('classic')

plt.rcParams\['savefig.facecolor'\] = "0.8" plt.rcParams\['figure.figsize'\] = 4, 3

fig, axes\_list = plt.subplots(2, 1) for ax in axes\_list.flat: ax.set(xlabel="x-label", ylabel="y-label", title="before tight\_layout") ax.locator\_params(nbins=3)

plt.show()

plt.rcParams\['savefig.facecolor'\] = "0.8" plt.rcParams\['figure.figsize'\] = 4, 3

fig, axes\_list = plt.subplots(2, 1) for ax in axes\_list.flat: ax.set(xlabel="x-label", ylabel="y-label", title="after tight\_layout") ax.locator\_params(nbins=3)

plt.tight\_layout() plt.show()

</div>

The usage of this functionality can be as simple as :

    plt.tight_layout()

and it will adjust the spacing between subplots so that the axis labels do not overlap with neighboring subplots. A \[tight\_layout\_guide\](\#tight\_layout\_guide) has been created to show how to use this new tool.

## PyQT4, PySide, and IPython

Gerald Storer made the Qt4 backend compatible with PySide as well as PyQT4. At present, however, PySide does not support the PyOS\_InputHook mechanism for handling gui events while waiting for text input, so it cannot be used with the new version 0.11 of [IPython](http://ipython.org). Until this feature appears in PySide, IPython users should use the PyQT4 wrapper for QT4, which remains the matplotlib default.

An rcParam entry, "backend.qt4", has been added to allow users to select PyQt4, PyQt4v2, or PySide. The latter two use the Version 2 Qt API. In most cases, users can ignore this rcParam variable; it is available to aid in testing, and to provide control for users who are embedding matplotlib in a PyQt4 or PySide app.

## Legend

Jae-Joon Lee has improved plot legends. First, legends for complex plots such as <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.stem</span> plots will now display correctly. Second, the 'best' placement of a legend has been improved in the presence of NANs.

See the \[legend\_guide\](\#legend\_guide) for more detailed explanation and examples.

![](../../gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/images/sphx_glr_legend_demo_004.png)

## mplot3d

In continuing the efforts to make 3D plotting in matplotlib just as easy as 2D plotting, Ben Root has made several improvements to the `~mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` module.

  - <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D</span> has been improved to bring the class towards feature-parity with regular Axes objects
  - Documentation for \[mplot3d\](\#mplot3d) was significantly expanded
  - Axis labels and orientation improved
  - Most 3D plotting functions now support empty inputs
  - Ticker offset display added:

![](../../gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_offset_001.png)

  - <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.contourf</span> gains *zdir* and *offset* kwargs. You can now do this:

![](../../gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_contourf3d_2_001.png)

## Numerix support removed

After more than two years of deprecation warnings, Numerix support has now been completely removed from matplotlib.

## Markers

The list of available markers for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.plot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.scatter</span> has now been merged. While they were mostly similar, some markers existed for one function, but not the other. This merge did result in a conflict for the 'd' diamond marker. Now, 'd' will be interpreted to always mean "thin" diamond while 'D' will mean "regular" diamond.

Thanks to Michael Droettboom for this effort.

## Other improvements

  - Unit support for polar axes and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.arrow</span>
  - <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes</span> gains getters and setters for "theta\_direction", and "theta\_offset" to allow for theta to go in either the clock-wise or counter-clockwise direction and to specify where zero degrees should be placed. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes.set\_theta\_zero\_location</span> is an added convenience function.
  - Fixed error in argument handling for tri-functions such as <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.tripcolor</span>
  - `axes.labelweight` parameter added to rcParams.
  - For <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow</span>, *interpolation='nearest'* will now always perform an interpolation. A "none" option has been added to indicate no interpolation at all.
  - An error in the Hammer projection has been fixed.
  - *clabel* for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contour</span> now accepts a callable. Thanks to Daniel Hyams for the original patch.
  - Jae-Joon Lee added the <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider.HBoxDivider</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_divider.VBoxDivider</span> classes.
  - Christoph Gohlke reduced memory usage in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imshow</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.scatter</span> now accepts empty inputs.
  - The behavior for 'symlog' scale has been fixed, but this may result in some minor changes to existing plots. This work was refined by ssyr.
  - Peter Butterworth added named figure support to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span>.
  - Michiel de Hoon has modified the MacOSX backend to make its interactive behavior consistent with the other backends.
  - Pim Schellart added a new colormap called "cubehelix". Sameer Grover also added a colormap called "coolwarm". See it and all other colormaps \[here \<color-colormaps\_reference\>\](\#here-\<color-colormaps\_reference\>).
  - Many bug fixes and documentation improvements.

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.2 (Nov 9, 2012)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

\> **Note** \> matplotlib 1.2 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, and 3.1

## Python 3.x support

Matplotlib 1.2 is the first version to support Python 3.x, specifically Python 3.1 and 3.2. To make this happen in a reasonable way, we also had to drop support for Python versions earlier than 2.6.

This work was done by Michael Droettboom, the Cape Town Python Users' Group, many others and supported financially in part by the SAGE project.

The following GUI backends work under Python 3.x: Gtk3Cairo, Qt4Agg, TkAgg and MacOSX. The other GUI backends do not yet have adequate bindings for Python 3.x, but continue to work on Python 2.6 and 2.7, particularly the Qt and QtAgg backends (which have been deprecated). The non-GUI backends, such as PDF, PS and SVG, work on both Python 2.x and 3.x.

Features that depend on the Python Imaging Library, such as JPEG handling, do not work, since the version of PIL for Python 3.x is not sufficiently mature.

## PGF/TikZ backend

Peter Würtz wrote a backend that allows matplotlib to export figures as drawing commands for LaTeX. These can be processed by PdfLaTeX, XeLaTeX or LuaLaTeX using the PGF/TikZ package. Usage examples and documentation are found in \[pgf\](\#pgf).

![image](/_static/pgf_preamble.*)

## Locator interface

Philip Elson exposed the intelligence behind the tick Locator classes with a simple interface. For instance, to get no more than 5 sensible steps which span the values 10 and 19.5:

    >>> import matplotlib.ticker as mticker
    >>> locator = mticker.MaxNLocator(nbins=5)
    >>> print(locator.tick_values(10, 19.5))
    [ 10.  12.  14.  16.  18.  20.]

## Tri-Surface Plots

Damon McDougall added a new plotting method for the `~mpl_toolkits.mplot3d` toolkit called <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_trisurf</span>.

![](../../gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_trisurf3d_001.png)

## Control the lengths of colorbar extensions

Andrew Dawson added a new keyword argument *extendfrac* to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar</span> to control the length of minimum and maximum colorbar extensions.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

plt.style.use('classic')

x = y = np.linspace(0., 2\*np.pi, 100) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) Z = np.cos(X) \* np.sin(0.5\*Y)

clevs = \[-.75, -.5, -.25, 0., .25, .5, .75\] cmap = plt.get\_cmap(name='jet', lut=8)

ax1 = plt.subplot(211) cs1 = plt.contourf(x, y, Z, clevs, cmap=cmap, extend='both') cb1 = plt.colorbar(orientation='horizontal', extendfrac=None) cb1.set\_label('Default length colorbar extensions')

ax2 = plt.subplot(212) cs2 = plt.contourf(x, y, Z, clevs, cmap=cmap, extend='both') cb2 = plt.colorbar(orientation='horizontal', extendfrac='auto') cb2.set\_label('Custom length colorbar extensions')

plt.show()

</div>

## Figures are picklable

Philip Elson added an experimental feature to make figures picklable for quick and easy short-term storage of plots. Pickle files are not designed for long term storage, are unsupported when restoring a pickle saved in another matplotlib version and are insecure when restoring a pickle from an untrusted source. Having said this, they are useful for short term storage for later modification inside matplotlib.

## Set default bounding box in matplotlibrc

Two new defaults are available in the matplotlibrc configuration file: `savefig.bbox`, which can be set to 'standard' or 'tight', and `savefig.pad_inches`, which controls the bounding box padding.

## New Boxplot Functionality

Users can now incorporate their own methods for computing the median and its confidence intervals into the <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span> method. For every column of data passed to boxplot, the user can specify an accompanying median and confidence interval.

![](../../gallery/statistics/images/sphx_glr_boxplot_demo_003.png)

## New RC parameter functionality

Matthew Emmett added a function and a context manager to help manage RC parameters: <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_file</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.rc\_context</span>. To load RC parameters from a file:

    >>> mpl.rc_file('mpl.rc')

To temporarily use RC parameters:

    >>> with mpl.rc_context(fname='mpl.rc', rc={'text.usetex': True}):
    >>>     ...

## Streamplot

Tom Flannaghan and Tony Yu have added a new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot</span> function to plot the streamlines of a vector field. This has been a long-requested feature and complements the existing <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.quiver</span> function for plotting vector fields. In addition to simply plotting the streamlines of the vector field, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot</span> allows users to map the colors and/or line widths of the streamlines to a separate parameter, such as the speed or local intensity of the vector field.

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_plot_streamplot_001.png)

## New hist functionality

Nic Eggert added a new *stacked* kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.hist</span> that allows creation of stacked histograms using any of the histogram types. Previously, this functionality was only available by using the "barstacked" histogram type. Now, when `stacked=True` is passed to the function, any of the histogram types can be stacked. The "barstacked" histogram type retains its previous functionality for backwards compatibility.

## Updated shipped dependencies

The following dependencies that ship with matplotlib and are optionally installed alongside it have been updated:

  - [pytz](http://pytz.sourceforge.net/) 2012d

  -   - [dateutil](http://labix.org/python-dateutil) 1.5 on Python 2.x,  
        and 2.1 on Python 3.x

## Face-centred colors in tripcolor plots

Ian Thomas extended <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.tripcolor</span> to allow one color value to be specified for each triangular face rather than for each point in a triangulation.

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_tripcolor_demo_001.png)

## Hatching patterns in filled contour plots, with legends

Phil Elson added support for hatching to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span>, together with the ability to use a legend to identify contoured ranges.

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_contourf_hatching_001.png)

## Known issues in the matplotlib 1.2 release

  - When using the Qt4Agg backend with IPython 0.11 or later, the save dialog will not display. This should be fixed in a future version of IPython.

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.3 (Aug 01, 2013)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

\> **Note** \> matplotlib 1.3 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, and 3.3

## New in 1.3.1

1.3.1 is a micro release, primarily dealing with improved setup and handling of dependencies, and correcting and enhancing the documentation.

The following changes were made in 1.3.1 since 1.3.0.

### Enhancements

  - Added a context manager for creating multi-page pdfs (see <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf.PdfPages</span>).
  - The WebAgg backend should now have lower latency over heterogeneous Internet connections.

### Bug fixes

  - Histogram plots now contain the endline.
  - Fixes to the Molleweide projection.
  - Handling recent fonts from Microsoft and Macintosh-style fonts with non-ascii metadata is improved.
  - Hatching of fill between plots now works correctly in the PDF backend.
  - Tight bounding box support now works in the PGF backend.
  - Transparent figures now display correctly in the Qt4Agg backend.
  - Drawing lines from one subplot to another now works.
  - Unit handling on masked arrays has been improved.

### Setup and dependencies

  - Now works with any version of pyparsing 1.5.6 or later, without displaying hundreds of warnings.
  - Now works with 64-bit versions of Ghostscript on MS-Windows.
  - When installing from source into an environment without Numpy, Numpy will first be downloaded and built and then used to build matplotlib.
  - Externally installed backends are now always imported using a fully-qualified path to the module.
  - Works with newer version of wxPython.
  - Can now build with a PyCXX installed globally on the system from source.
  - Better detection of Gtk3 dependencies.

### Testing

  - Tests should now work in non-English locales.
  - PEP8 conformance tests now report on locations of issues.

## New plotting features

### <span class="title-ref">\~.xkcd</span>-style sketch plotting

To give your plots a sense of authority that they may be missing, Michael Droettboom (inspired by the work of many others in `1329`) has added an [xkcd-style](https://xkcd.com/) sketch plotting mode. To use it, simply call <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.xkcd</span> before creating your plot. For really fine control, it is also possible to modify each artist's sketch parameters individually with <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.artist.Artist.set\_sketch\_params</span>.

![](../../gallery/showcase/images/sphx_glr_xkcd_001.png)

## Updated Axes3D.contour methods

Damon McDougall updated the <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.tricontour</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.tricontourf</span> methods to allow 3D contour plots on arbitrary unstructured user-specified triangulations.

![](../../gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_tricontour3d_001.png)

### New eventplot plot type

Todd Jennings added a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.eventplot</span> function to create multiple rows or columns of identical line segments

![](../../gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/images/sphx_glr_eventplot_demo_001.png)

As part of this feature, there is a new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.EventCollection</span> class that allows for plotting and manipulating rows or columns of identical line segments.

### Triangular grid interpolation

Geoffroy Billotey and Ian Thomas added classes to perform interpolation within triangular grids: (<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.tri.LinearTriInterpolator</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.tri.CubicTriInterpolator</span>) and a utility class to find the triangles in which points lie (<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.tri.TrapezoidMapTriFinder</span>). A helper class to perform mesh refinement and smooth contouring was also added (<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.tri.UniformTriRefiner</span>). Finally, a class implementing some basic tools for triangular mesh improvement was added (<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.tri.TriAnalyzer</span>).

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_tricontour_smooth_user_001.png)

### Baselines for stackplot

Till Stensitzki added non-zero baselines to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.stackplot</span>. They may be symmetric or weighted.

![](../../gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/images/sphx_glr_stackplot_demo_001.png)

### Rectangular colorbar extensions

Andrew Dawson added a new keyword argument *extendrect* to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.colorbar</span> to optionally make colorbar extensions rectangular instead of triangular.

### More robust boxplots

Paul Hobson provided a fix to the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot</span> method that prevent whiskers from being drawn inside the box for oddly distributed data sets.

### Calling subplot() without arguments

A call to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot</span> without any arguments now acts the same as `subplot(111)` or `subplot(1, 1, 1)` -- it creates one axes for the whole figure. This was already the behavior for both <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.axes</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span>, and now this consistency is shared with <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot</span>.

## Drawing

### Independent alpha values for face and edge colors

Wes Campaigne modified how <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> objects are drawn such that (for backends supporting transparency) you can set different alpha values for faces and edges, by specifying their colors in RGBA format. Note that if you set the alpha attribute for the patch object (e.g. using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch.set\_alpha</span> or the `alpha` keyword argument), that value will override the alpha components set in both the face and edge colors.

### Path effects on lines

Thanks to Jae-Joon Lee, path effects now also work on plot lines.

![](../../gallery/misc/images/sphx_glr_patheffect_demo_001.png)

### Easier creation of colormap and normalizer for levels with colors

Phil Elson added the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.from\_levels\_and\_colors</span> function to easily create a colormap and normalizer for representation of discrete colors for plot types such as <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh</span>, with a similar interface to that of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span>.

### Full control of the background color

Wes Campaigne and Phil Elson fixed the Agg backend such that PNGs are now saved with the correct background color when `fig.patch.get_alpha()` is not 1.

### Improved `bbox_inches="tight"` functionality

Passing `bbox_inches="tight"` through to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.savefig</span> now takes into account *all* artists on a figure - this was previously not the case and led to several corner cases which did not function as expected.

### Initialize a rotated rectangle

Damon McDougall extended the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle</span> constructor to accept an *angle* kwarg, specifying the rotation of a rectangle in degrees.

## Text

### Anchored text support

The SVG and pgf backends are now able to save text alignment information to their output formats. This allows to edit text elements in saved figures, using Inkscape for example, while preserving their intended position. For SVG please note that you'll have to disable the default text-to-path conversion (`mpl.rc('svg', fonttype='none')`).

### Better vertical text alignment and multi-line text

The vertical alignment of text is now consistent across backends. You may see small differences in text placement, particularly with rotated text.

If you are using a custom backend, note that the <span class="title-ref">\~.RendererBase.draw\_text</span> renderer method is now passed the location of the baseline, not the location of the bottom of the text bounding box.

Multi-line text will now leave enough room for the height of very tall or very low text, such as superscripts and subscripts.

### Left and right side axes titles

Andrew Dawson added the ability to add axes titles flush with the left and right sides of the top of the axes using a new keyword argument *loc* to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.title</span>.

### Improved manual contour plot label positioning

Brian Mattern modified the manual contour plot label positioning code to interpolate along line segments and find the actual closest point on a contour to the requested position. Previously, the closest path vertex was used, which, in the case of straight contours was sometimes quite distant from the requested location. Much more precise label positioning is now possible.

## Configuration (rcParams)

### Quickly find rcParams

Phil Elson made it easier to search for rcParameters by passing a valid regular expression to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.RcParams.find\_all</span>. <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.RcParams</span> now also has a pretty repr and str representation so that search results are printed prettily:

> \>\>\> import matplotlib \>\>\> print(matplotlib.rcParams.find\_all('.size')) RcParams({'font.size': 12, 'xtick.major.size': 4, 'xtick.minor.size': 2, 'ytick.major.size': 4, 'ytick.minor.size': 2})

### `axes.xmargin` and `axes.ymargin` added to rcParams

`axes.xmargin` and `axes.ymargin` were added to configure the default margins used. Previously they were hard-coded to default to 0, default value of both rcParam values is 0.

### Changes to font rcParams

The `font.*` rcParams now affect only text objects created after the rcParam has been set, and will not retroactively affect already existing text objects. This brings their behavior in line with most other rcParams.

### Added `savefig.jpeg_quality` rcParam

The `savefig.jpeg_quality` rcParam was added so that the user can configure the default quality used when a figure is written as a JPEG. The default quality is 95; previously, the default quality was 75. This change minimizes the artifacting inherent in JPEG images, particularly with images that have sharp changes in color as plots often do.

## Backends

### WebAgg backend

Michael Droettboom, Phil Elson and others have developed a new backend, WebAgg, to display figures in a web browser. It works with animations as well as being fully interactive.

![image](/_static/webagg_screenshot.png)

Future versions of matplotlib will integrate this backend with the IPython notebook for a fully web browser based plotting frontend.

### Remember save directory

Martin Spacek made the save figure dialog remember the last directory saved to. The default is configurable with the new `savefig.directory` rcParam in `matplotlibrc`.

## Documentation and examples

### Numpydoc docstrings

Nelle Varoquaux has started an ongoing project to convert matplotlib's docstrings to numpydoc format. See [MEP10](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/Mep10) for more information.

### Example reorganization

Tony Yu has begun work reorganizing the examples into more meaningful categories. The new gallery page is the fruit of this ongoing work. See [MEP12](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/wiki/MEP12) for more information.

### Examples now use subplots()

For the sake of brevity and clarity, most of the \[examples \<examples-index\>\](\#examples \<examples-index\>) now use the newer <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span>, which creates a figure and one (or multiple) axes object(s) in one call. The old way involved a call to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span>, followed by one (or multiple) <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot</span> calls.

## Infrastructure

### Housecleaning

A number of features that were deprecated in 1.2 or earlier, or have not been in a working state for a long time have been removed. Highlights include removing the Qt version 3 backends, and the FltkAgg and Emf backends. See \[changes\_in\_1\_3\](\#changes\_in\_1\_3) for a complete list.

### New setup script

matplotlib 1.3 includes an entirely rewritten setup script. We now ship fewer dependencies with the tarballs and installers themselves. Notably, [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/), [dateutil](https://pypi.org/project/python-dateutil/), [pyparsing](https://pypi.org/project/pyparsing/) and [six](https://pypi.org/project/six/) are no longer included with matplotlib. You can either install them manually first, or let [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/) install them as dependencies along with matplotlib. It is now possible to not include certain subcomponents, such as the unit test data, in the install. See `setup.cfg.template` for more information.

### XDG base directory support

On Linux, matplotlib now uses the [XDG base directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) to find the `matplotlibrc` configuration file. `matplotlibrc` should now be kept in `~/.config/matplotlib`, rather than `~/.matplotlib`. If your configuration is found in the old location, it will still be used, but a warning will be displayed.

### Catch opening too many figures using pyplot

Figures created through <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.figure</span> are retained until they are explicitly closed. It is therefore common for new users of matplotlib to run out of memory when creating a large series of figures in a loop without closing them.

matplotlib will now display a <span class="title-ref">RuntimeWarning</span> when too many figures have been opened at once. By default, this is displayed for 20 or more figures, but the exact number may be controlled using the `figure.max_open_warning` rcParam.

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.4 (Aug 25, 2014)

Thomas A. Caswell served as the release manager for the 1.4 release.

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

\> **Note** \> matplotlib 1.4 supports Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, and 3.4

## New colormap

In heatmaps, a green-to-red spectrum is often used to indicate intensity of activity, but this can be problematic for the red/green colorblind. A new, colorblind-friendly colormap is now available at `matplotlib.cm.Wistia`. This colormap maintains the red/green symbolism while achieving deuteranopic legibility through brightness variations. See [here](https://github.com/wistia/heatmap-palette) for more information.

## The nbagg backend

Phil Elson added a new backend, named "nbagg", which enables interactive figures in a live IPython notebook session. The backend makes use of the infrastructure developed for the webagg backend, which itself gives standalone server backed interactive figures in the browser, however nbagg does not require a dedicated matplotlib server as all communications are handled through the IPython Comm machinery.

As with other backends nbagg can be enabled inside the IPython notebook with:

    import matplotlib
    matplotlib.use('nbagg')

Once figures are created and then subsequently shown, they will placed in an interactive widget inside the notebook allowing panning and zooming in the same way as any other matplotlib backend. Because figures require a connection to the IPython notebook server for their interactivity, once the notebook is saved, each figure will be rendered as a static image - thus allowing non-interactive viewing of figures on services such as [nbviewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

## New plotting features

### Power-law normalization

Ben Gamari added a power-law normalization method, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.PowerNorm</span>. This class maps a range of values to the interval \[0,1\] with power-law scaling with the exponent provided by the constructor's *gamma* argument. Power law normalization can be useful for, e.g., emphasizing small populations in a histogram.

### Fully customizable boxplots

Paul Hobson overhauled the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot</span> method such that it is now completely customizable in terms of the styles and positions of the individual artists. Under the hood, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot</span> relies on a new function (<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span>), which accepts any data structure currently compatible with <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot</span>, and returns a list of dictionaries containing the positions for each element of the boxplots. Then a second method, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> is called to draw the boxplots based on the stats.

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.boxplot</span> function can be used as before to generate boxplots from data in one step. But now the user has the flexibility to generate the statistics independently, or to modify the output of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.boxplot\_stats</span> prior to plotting with <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span>.

Lastly, each artist (e.g., the box, outliers, cap, notches) can now be toggled on or off and their styles can be passed in through individual kwargs. See the examples: \[/gallery/statistics/boxplot\](/gallery/statistics/boxplot.md) and \[/gallery/statistics/bxp\](/gallery/statistics/bxp.md)

Added a bool kwarg, `manage_xticks`, which if False disables the management of the ticks and limits on the x-axis by <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bxp</span>.

### Support for datetime axes in 2d plots

Andrew Dawson added support for datetime axes to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contour</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.pcolormesh</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.pcolor</span>.

### Support for additional spectrum types

Todd Jennings added support for new types of frequency spectrum plots: <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.magnitude\_spectrum</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.phase\_spectrum</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.angle\_spectrum</span>, as well as corresponding functions in mlab.

He also added these spectrum types to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.specgram</span>, as well as adding support for linear scaling there (in addition to the existing dB scaling). Support for additional spectrum types was also added to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.mlab.specgram</span>.

He also increased the performance for all of these functions and plot types.

### Support for detrending and windowing 2D arrays in mlab

Todd Jennings added support for 2D arrays in the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.mlab.detrend\_mean</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.mlab.detrend\_none</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.mlab.detrend</span>, as well as adding `matplotlib.mlab.apply_window` which support windowing 2D arrays.

### Support for strides in mlab

Todd Jennings added some functions to mlab to make it easier to use NumPy strides to create memory-efficient 2D arrays. This includes `matplotlib.mlab.stride_repeat`, which repeats an array to create a 2D array, and `matplotlib.mlab.stride_windows`, which uses a moving window to create a 2D array from a 1D array.

### Formatter for new-style formatting strings

Added <span class="title-ref">.StrMethodFormatter</span> which does the same job as <span class="title-ref">.FormatStrFormatter</span>, but accepts new-style formatting strings instead of printf-style formatting strings

### Consistent grid sizes in streamplots

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.streamplot</span> uses a base grid size of 30x30 for both `density=1` and `density=(1, 1)`. Previously a grid size of 30x30 was used for `density=1`, but a grid size of 25x25 was used for `density=(1, 1)`.

### Get a list of all tick labels (major and minor)

Added the kwarg 'which' to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_xticklabels</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_yticklabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_ticklabels</span>. 'which' can be 'major', 'minor', or 'both' select which ticks to return, like <span class="title-ref">\~.XAxis.set\_ticks\_position</span>. If 'which' is <span class="title-ref">None</span> then the old behaviour (controlled by the bool *minor*).

### Separate horizontal/vertical axes padding support in ImageGrid

The kwarg 'axes\_pad' to <span class="title-ref">mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.axes\_grid.ImageGrid</span> can now be a tuple if separate horizontal/vertical padding is needed. This is supposed to be very helpful when you have a labelled legend next to every subplot and you need to make some space for legend's labels.

### Support for skewed transformations

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Affine2D</span> gained additional methods <span class="title-ref">.skew</span> and <span class="title-ref">.skew\_deg</span> to create skewed transformations. Additionally, matplotlib internals were cleaned up to support using such transforms in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span>. This transform is important for some plot types, specifically the Skew-T used in meteorology.

![](../../gallery/specialty_plots/images/sphx_glr_skewt_001.png)

### Support for specifying properties of wedge and text in pie charts.

Added the kwargs 'wedgeprops' and 'textprops' to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pie</span> to accept properties for wedge and text objects in a pie. For example, one can specify wedgeprops = {'linewidth':3} to specify the width of the borders of the wedges in the pie. For more properties that the user can specify, look at the docs for the wedge and text objects.

### Fixed the direction of errorbar upper/lower limits

Larry Bradley fixed the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.errorbar</span> method such that the upper and lower limits (*lolims*, *uplims*, *xlolims*, *xuplims*) now point in the correct direction.

### More consistent add-object API for Axes

Added the Axes method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.add\_image</span> to put image handling on a par with artists, collections, containers, lines, patches, and tables.

### Violin Plots

Per Parker, Gregory Kelsie, Adam Ortiz, Kevin Chan, Geoffrey Lee, Deokjae Donald Seo, and Taesu Terry Lim added a basic implementation for violin plots. Violin plots can be used to represent the distribution of sample data. They are similar to box plots, but use a kernel density estimation function to present a smooth approximation of the data sample used. The added features are:

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.violin</span> - Renders a violin plot from a collection of statistics. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.violin\_stats</span> - Produces a collection of statistics suitable for rendering a violin plot. <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.violinplot</span> - Creates a violin plot from a set of sample data. This method makes use of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.violin\_stats</span> to process the input data, and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.violin\_stats</span> to do the actual rendering. Users are also free to modify or replace the output of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.violin\_stats</span> in order to customize the violin plots to their liking.

This feature was implemented for a software engineering course at the University of Toronto, Scarborough, run in Winter 2014 by Anya Tafliovich.

### More *markevery* options to show only a subset of markers

Rohan Walker extended the *markevery* property in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.lines.Line2D</span>. You can now specify a subset of markers to show with an int, slice object, numpy fancy indexing, or float. Using a float shows markers at approximately equal display-coordinate-distances along the line.

### Added size related functions to specialized <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>s

Added the `get_size` and `set_size` functions to control the size of elements of specialized collections ( <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.AsteriskPolygonCollection</span> `matplotlib.collections.BrokenBarHCollection` <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.CircleCollection</span> <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection</span> <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection</span> <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.RegularPolyCollection</span> <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.StarPolygonCollection</span>).

### Fixed the mouse coordinates giving the wrong theta value in Polar graph

Added code to <span class="title-ref">\~.polar.InvertedPolarTransform.transform\_non\_affine</span> to ensure that the calculated theta value was between the range of 0 and 2 \* pi since the problem was that the value can become negative after applying the direction and rotation to the theta calculation.

### Simple quiver plot for mplot3d toolkit

A team of students in an *Engineering Large Software Systems* course, taught by Prof. Anya Tafliovich at the University of Toronto, implemented a simple version of a quiver plot in 3D space for the mplot3d toolkit as one of their term project. This feature is documented in <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.quiver</span>. The team members are: Ryan Steve D'Souza, Victor B, xbtsw, Yang Wang, David, Caradec Bisesar and Vlad Vassilovski.

![](../../gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_quiver3d_001.png)

### polar-plot r-tick locations

Added the ability to control the angular position of the r-tick labels on a polar plot via <span class="title-ref">\~.PolarAxes.set\_rlabel\_position</span>.

## Date handling

### n-d array support for date conversion

Andrew Dawson added support for n-d array handling to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.num2date</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.date2num</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.datestr2num</span>. Support is also added to the unit conversion interfaces <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates.DateConverter</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.units.Registry</span>.

## Configuration (rcParams)

### `savefig.transparent` added

Controls whether figures are saved with a transparent background by default. Previously <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span> always defaulted to a non-transparent background.

### `axes.titleweight`

Added rcParam to control the weight of the title

### `axes.formatter.useoffset` added

Controls the default value of *useOffset* in <span class="title-ref">.ScalarFormatter</span>. If <span class="title-ref">True</span> and the data range is much smaller than the data average, then an offset will be determined such that the tick labels are meaningful. If <span class="title-ref">False</span> then the full number will be formatted in all conditions.

### `nbagg.transparent` added

Controls whether nbagg figures have a transparent background. `nbagg.transparent` is `True` by default.

### XDG compliance

Matplotlib now looks for configuration files (both rcparams and style) in XDG compliant locations.

## `style` package added

You can now easily switch between different styles using the new `style` package:

    >>> from matplotlib import style
    >>> style.use('dark_background')

Subsequent plots will use updated colors, sizes, etc. To list all available styles, use:

    >>> print style.available

You can add your own custom `<style name>.mplstyle` files to `~/.matplotlib/stylelib` or call `use` with a URL pointing to a file with `matplotlibrc` settings.

*Note that this is an experimental feature*, and the interface may change as users test out this new feature.

## Backends

### Qt5 backend

Martin Fitzpatrick and Tom Badran implemented a Qt5 backend. The differences in namespace locations between Qt4 and Qt5 was dealt with by shimming Qt4 to look like Qt5, thus the Qt5 implementation is the primary implementation. Backwards compatibility for Qt4 is maintained by wrapping the Qt5 implementation.

The Qt5Agg backend currently does not work with IPython's %matplotlib magic.

The 1.4.0 release has a known bug where the toolbar is broken. This can be fixed by: :

    cd path/to/installed/matplotlib
    wget https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/pull/3322.diff
    # unix2dos 3322.diff (if on windows to fix line endings)
    patch -p2 < 3322.diff

### Qt4 backend

Rudolf Höfler changed the appearance of the subplottool. All sliders are vertically arranged now, buttons for tight layout and reset were added. Furthermore, the subplottool is now implemented as a modal dialog. It was previously a QMainWindow, leaving the SPT open if one closed the plot window.

In the figure options dialog one can now choose to (re-)generate a simple automatic legend. Any explicitly set legend entries will be lost, but changes to the curves' label, linestyle, et cetera will now be updated in the legend.

Interactive performance of the Qt4 backend has been dramatically improved under windows.

The mapping of key-signals from Qt to values matplotlib understands was greatly improved (For both Qt4 and Qt5).

### Cairo backends

The Cairo backends are now able to use the [cairocffi bindings](https://github.com/SimonSapin/cairocffi) which are more actively maintained than the [pycairo bindings](https://www.cairographics.org/pycairo/).

### Gtk3Agg backend

The Gtk3Agg backend now works on Python 3.x, if the [cairocffi bindings](https://github.com/SimonSapin/cairocffi) are installed.

### PDF backend

Added context manager for saving to multi-page PDFs.

## Text

### Text URLs supported by SVG backend

The SVG backend will now render <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.text.Text</span> objects' url as a link in output SVGs. This allows one to make clickable text in saved figures using the url kwarg of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.text.Text</span> class.

### Anchored sizebar font

Added the `fontproperties` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.anchored\_artists.AnchoredSizeBar</span> to control the font properties.

## Sphinx extensions

The `:context:` directive in the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.sphinxext.plot\_directive</span> Sphinx extension can now accept an optional `reset` setting, which will cause the context to be reset. This allows more than one distinct context to be present in documentation. To enable this option, use `:context: reset` instead of `:context:` any time you want to reset the context.

## Legend and PathEffects documentation

The \[legend\_guide\](\#legend\_guide) and \[patheffects\_guide\](\#patheffects\_guide) have both been updated to better reflect the full potential of each of these powerful features.

## Widgets

### Span Selector

Added an option `span_stays` to the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.SpanSelector</span> which makes the selector rectangle stay on the axes after you release the mouse.

## GAE integration

Matplotlib will now run on google app engine.

# What's new in Matplotlib 1.5 (Oct 29, 2015)

<div class="contents" data-depth="2">

Table of Contents

</div>

\> **Note** \> matplotlib 1.5 supports Python 2.7, 3.4, and 3.5

## Interactive OO usage

All <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s now keep track of if their internal state has been changed but not reflected in the display ('stale') by a call to `draw`. It is thus possible to pragmatically determine if a given <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> needs to be re-drawn in an interactive session.

To facilitate interactive usage a `draw_all` method has been added to `pyplot` which will redraw all of the figures which are 'stale'.

To make this convenient for interactive use matplotlib now registers a function either with IPython's 'post\_execute' event or with the displayhook in the standard python REPL to automatically call `plt.draw_all` just before control is returned to the REPL. This ensures that the draw command is deferred and only called once.

The upshot of this is that for interactive backends (including `%matplotlib notebook`) in interactive mode (with `plt.ion()`)

`` `python    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt    fig, ax = plt.subplots()    ln, = ax.plot([0, 1, 4, 9, 16])    plt.show()    ln.set_color('g')   will automatically update the plot to be green.  Any subsequent ``<span class="title-ref"> modifications to the </span><span class="title-ref">Artist</span>\` objects will do likewise.

This is the first step of a larger consolidation and simplification of the pyplot internals.

## Working with labeled data like pandas DataFrames

Plot methods which take arrays as inputs can now also work with labeled data and unpack such data.

This means that the following two examples produce the same plot:

Example :

    df = pandas.DataFrame({"var1":[1,2,3,4,5,6], "var2":[1,2,3,4,5,6]})
    plt.plot(df["var1"], df["var2"])

Example :

    plt.plot("var1", "var2", data=df)

This works for most plotting methods, which expect arrays/sequences as inputs. `data` can be anything which supports `__getitem__` (`dict`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `h5py`, ...) to access `array` like values with string keys.

In addition to this, some other changes were made, which makes working with labeled data (ex `pandas.Series`) easier:

  - For plotting methods with `label` keyword argument, one of the data inputs is designated as the label source. If the user does not supply a `label` that value object will be introspected for a label, currently by looking for a `name` attribute. If the value object does not have a `name` attribute but was specified by as a key into the `data` kwarg, then the key is used. In the above examples, this results in an implicit `label="var2"` for both cases.
  - `plot()` now uses the index of a `Series` instead of `np.arange(len(y))`, if no `x` argument is supplied.

## Added `axes.prop_cycle` key to rcParams

This is a more generic form of the now-deprecated `axes.color_cycle` param. Now, we can cycle more than just colors, but also linestyles, hatches, and just about any other artist property. Cycler notation is used for defining property cycles. Adding cyclers together will be like you are <span class="title-ref">zip</span>-ing together two or more property cycles together:

    axes.prop_cycle: cycler('color', 'rgb') + cycler('lw', [1, 2, 3])

You can even multiply cyclers, which is like using <span class="title-ref">itertools.product</span> on two or more property cycles.

![](/users/explain/artists/images/sphx_glr_color_cycle_001.png)

## New Colormaps

All four of the colormaps proposed as the new default are available as `'viridis'` (the new default in 2.0), `'magma'`, `'plasma'`, and `'inferno'`

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np from cycler import cycler cmap = cycler('cmap', \['viridis', 'magma','plasma', 'inferno'\]) x\_mode = cycler('x', \[1, 2\]) y\_mode = cycler('y', x\_mode)

cy = (x\_mode \* y\_mode) + cmap

  - def demo(ax, x, y, cmap):  
    X, Y = np.ogrid\[0:2\*np.pi:200j, 0:2\*np.pi:200j\] data = np.sin(X\*x) \* np.cos(Y\*y) ax.imshow(data, interpolation='none', cmap=cmap) ax.set\_title(cmap)

fig, axes = plt.subplots(2, 2) for ax, sty in zip(axes.ravel(), cy): demo(ax, \*\*sty)

fig.tight\_layout()

</div>

## Styles

Several new styles have been added, including many styles from the Seaborn project. Additionally, in order to prep for the upcoming 2.0 style-change release, a 'classic' and 'default' style has been added. For this release, the 'default' and 'classic' styles are identical. By using them now in your scripts, you can help ensure a smooth transition during future upgrades of matplotlib, so that you can upgrade to the snazzy new defaults when you are ready\! :

    import matplotlib.style
    matplotlib.style.use('classic')

The 'default' style will give you matplotlib's latest plotting styles:

    matplotlib.style.use('default')

## Backends

### New backend selection

The environment variable `MPLBACKEND` can now be used to set the matplotlib backend.

### wx backend has been updated

The wx backend can now be used with both wxPython classic and [Phoenix](https://wxpython.org/Phoenix/docs/html/main.html).

wxPython classic has to be at least version 2.8.12 and works on Python 2.x. As of May 2015 no official release of wxPython Phoenix is available but a current snapshot will work on Python 2.7+ and 3.4+.

If you have multiple versions of wxPython installed, then the user code is responsible setting the wxPython version. How to do this is explained in the comment at the beginning of the example \[/gallery/user\_interfaces/embedding\_in\_wx2\_sgskip\](/gallery/user\_interfaces/embedding\_in\_wx2\_sgskip.md).

## Configuration (rcParams)

Some parameters have been added, others have been improved.

| Parameter                                    | Description                                                                                                                                                                            |

## Widgets

### Active state of Selectors

All selectors now implement `set_active` and `get_active` methods (also called when accessing the `active` property) to properly update and query whether they are active.

### Moved `ignore`, `set_active`, and `get_active` methods to base class `Widget`

Pushes up duplicate methods in child class to parent class to avoid duplication of code.

### Adds enable/disable feature to MultiCursor

A MultiCursor object can be disabled (and enabled) after it has been created without destroying the object. Example:

    multi_cursor.active = False

### Improved RectangleSelector and new EllipseSelector Widget

Adds an *interactive* keyword which enables visible handles for manipulating the shape after it has been drawn.

Adds keyboard modifiers for:

  - Moving the existing shape (default key = 'space')
  - Making the shape square (default 'shift')
  - Make the initial point the center of the shape (default 'control')
  - Square and center can be combined

### Allow Artists to Display Pixel Data in Cursor

Adds <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.get\_cursor\_data</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.format\_cursor\_data</span> methods to artists which can be used to add zdata to the cursor display in the status bar. Also adds an implementation for Images.

## New plotting features

### Auto-wrapping Text

Added the keyword argument "wrap" to Text, which automatically breaks long lines of text when being drawn. Works for any rotated text, different modes of alignment, and for text that are either labels or titles. This breaks at the `Figure`, not `Axes` edge.

<div class="plot">

fig, ax = plt.subplots() fig.patch.set\_color('.9') ax.text(.5, .75, "This is a really long string that should be wrapped so that " "it does not go outside the figure.", wrap=True)

</div>

### Contour plot corner masking

Ian Thomas rewrote the C++ code that calculates contours to add support for corner masking. This is controlled by a new keyword argument `corner_mask` in the functions <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contour</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.contourf</span>. The previous behaviour, which is now obtained using `corner_mask=False`, was for a single masked point to completely mask out all four quads touching that point. The new behaviour, obtained using `corner_mask=True`, only masks the corners of those quads touching the point; any triangular corners comprising three unmasked points are contoured as usual. If the `corner_mask` keyword argument is not specified, the default value is taken from rcParams.

![](../../gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_contour_corner_mask_001.png)

### Mostly unified linestyles for <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>

The handling of linestyles for Lines, Patches and Collections has been unified. Now they all support defining linestyles with short symbols, like "--", as well as with full names, like "dashed". Also the definition using a dash pattern (`(0., [3., 3.])`) is supported for all methods using <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>.

### Legend marker order

Added ability to place the label before the marker in a legend box with `markerfirst` keyword

### Support for legend for PolyCollection and stackplot

Added a `.legend_handler` for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection</span> as well as a *labels* argument to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.stackplot</span>.

### Support for alternate pivots in mplot3d quiver plot

Added a `pivot` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.quiver</span> that controls the pivot point around which the quiver line rotates. This also determines the placement of the arrow head along the quiver line.

### Logit Scale

Added support for the 'logit' axis scale, a nonlinear transformation

\[x -> \log10(x / (1-x))\]

for data between 0 and 1 excluded.

### Add step kwargs to fill\_between

Added `step` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.fill\_between</span> to allow to fill between lines drawn using the 'step' draw style. The values of `step` match those of the `where` kwarg of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.step</span>. The asymmetry of the kwargs names is not ideal, but <span class="title-ref">.Axes.fill\_between</span> already has a `where` kwarg.

This is particularly useful for plotting pre-binned histograms.

### Square Plot

Implemented square plots feature as a new parameter in the axis function. When argument 'square' is specified, equal scaling is set, and the limits are set such that `xmax-xmin == ymax-ymin`.

<div class="plot">

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.axis('square')

</div>

### Updated figimage to take optional resize parameter

Added the ability to plot simple 2D-Array using `plt.figimage(X, resize=True)`. This is useful for plotting simple 2D-Array without the Axes or whitespacing around the image.

<div class="plot">

data = np.random.random(\[500, 500\]) plt.figimage(data, resize=True)

</div>

### Updated Figure.savefig() can now use figure's dpi

Added support to save the figure with the same dpi as the figure on the screen using `dpi='figure'`:.

Example:

    f = plt.figure(dpi=25)  # dpi set to 25
    S = plt.scatter([1,2,3],[4,5,6])
    f.savefig('output.png', dpi='figure')  # output savefig dpi set to 25 (same as figure)

### Updated Table to control edge visibility

Added the ability to toggle the visibility of lines in Tables. Functionality added to the <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.table</span> factory function under the keyword argument "edges". Values can be the strings "open", "closed", "horizontal", "vertical" or combinations of the letters "L", "R", "T", "B" which represent left, right, top, and bottom respectively.

Example:

    table(..., edges="open")  # No line visible
    table(..., edges="closed")  # All lines visible
    table(..., edges="horizontal")  # Only top and bottom lines visible
    table(..., edges="LT")  # Only left and top lines visible.

### Zero r/cstride support in plot\_wireframe

Adam Hughes added support to mplot3d's plot\_wireframe to draw only row or column line plots.

<div class="plot">

from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D, axes3d fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add\_subplot(111, projection='3d') X, Y, Z = axes3d.get\_test\_data(0.05) ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=0)

</div>

### Plot bar and barh with labels

Added kwarg *tick\_label* to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.barh</span> to support plotting bar graphs with a text label for each bar.

<div class="plot">

  - plt.bar(\[1, 2\], \[.5, .75\], tick\_label=\['bar1', 'bar2'\],  
    align='center')

</div>

### Added center and frame kwargs to pie

These control where the center of the pie graph are and if the Axes frame is shown.

### Fixed 3D filled contour plot polygon rendering

Certain cases of 3D filled contour plots that produce polygons with multiple holes produced improper rendering due to a loss of path information between <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d.Poly3DCollection</span>. A function <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.PolyCollection.set\_verts\_and\_codes</span> was added to allow path information to be retained for proper rendering.

### Dense colorbars are rasterized

Vector file formats (pdf, ps, svg) are efficient for many types of plot element, but for some they can yield excessive file size and even rendering artifacts, depending on the renderer used for screen display. This is a problem for colorbars that show a large number of shades, as is most commonly the case. Now, if a colorbar is showing 50 or more colors, it will be rasterized in vector backends.

### DateFormatter strftime

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.dates.DateFormatter</span>'s `__call__` method will format a <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime</span> object with the format string passed to the formatter's constructor. This method accepts datetimes with years before 1900, unlike <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime.strftime</span>.

### Artist-level {get,set}\_usetex for text

Add `{get,set}_usetex` methods to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.text.Text</span> objects which allow artist-level control of LaTeX rendering vs. the internal mathtex rendering.

### `Axes.remove()` works as expected

As with artists added to an <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes</span> objects can be removed from their figure via <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.remove()</span>.

### API Consistency fix within Locators set\_params() function

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator.set\_params</span> function, which sets parameters within a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator</span> type instance, is now available to all <span class="title-ref">.Locator</span> types. The implementation also prevents unsafe usage by strictly defining the parameters that a user can set.

To use, call `set_params()` on a <span class="title-ref">.Locator</span> instance with desired arguments:

`` `python     loc = matplotlib.ticker.LogLocator()     # Set given attributes for loc.     loc.set_params(numticks=8, numdecs=8, subs=[2.0], base=8)     # The below will error, as there is no such parameter for LogLocator     # named foo     # loc.set_params(foo='bar')   Date Locators ``<span class="title-ref"> </span>`  ``  ``  `

Date Locators (derived from <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.dates.DateLocator</span>) now implement the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator.tick\_values</span> method. This is expected of all Locators derived from <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.Locator</span>.

The Date Locators can now be used easily without creating axes :

    from datetime import datetime
    from matplotlib.dates import YearLocator
    t0 = datetime(2002, 10, 9, 12, 10)
    tf = datetime(2005, 10, 9, 12, 15)
    loc = YearLocator()
    values = loc.tick_values(t0, tf)

### OffsetBoxes now support clipping

<span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s draw onto objects of type <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span> through <span class="title-ref">\~.offsetbox.DrawingArea</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.offsetbox.TextArea</span>. The <span class="title-ref">.TextArea</span> calculates the required space for the text and so the text is always within the bounds, for this nothing has changed.

However, <span class="title-ref">.DrawingArea</span> acts as a parent for zero or more <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s that draw on it and may do so beyond the bounds. Now child <span class="title-ref">.Artist</span>s can be clipped to the bounds of the <span class="title-ref">.DrawingArea</span>.

### OffsetBoxes now considered by tight\_layout

When <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.tight\_layout()</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Figure.tight\_layout</span> or <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec.tight\_layout()</span> is called, <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span>es that are anchored outside the axes will not get chopped out. The <span class="title-ref">.OffsetBox</span>es will also not get overlapped by other axes in case of multiple subplots.

### Per-page pdf notes in multi-page pdfs (PdfPages)

Add a new method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf.PdfPages.attach\_note</span> to the PdfPages class, allowing the attachment of simple text notes to pages in a multi-page pdf of figures. The new note is visible in the list of pdf annotations in a viewer that has this facility (Adobe Reader, OSX Preview, Skim, etc.). Per default the note itself is kept off-page to prevent it to appear in print-outs.

<span class="title-ref">.PdfPages.attach\_note</span> needs to be called before <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span> in order to be added to the correct figure.

### Updated fignum\_exists to take figure name

Added the ability to check the existence of a figure using its name instead of just the figure number. Example:

    figure('figure')
    fignum_exists('figure') #true

## ToolManager

Federico Ariza wrote the new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_managers.ToolManager</span> that comes as replacement for <span class="title-ref">.NavigationToolbar2</span>

<span class="title-ref">.ToolManager</span> offers a new way of looking at the user interactions with the figures. Before we had the <span class="title-ref">.NavigationToolbar2</span> with its own tools like `zoom/pan/home/save/...` and also we had the shortcuts like `yscale/grid/quit/....`. <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager</span> relocate all those actions as Tools (located in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_tools</span>), and defines a way to access/trigger/reconfigure them.

The Toolbars are replaced by <span class="title-ref">.ToolContainerBase</span>s that are just GUI interfaces to trigger the tools. But don't worry the default backends include a <span class="title-ref">.ToolContainerBase</span> called `toolbar`

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

At the moment, we release this primarily for feedback purposes and should be treated as experimental until further notice as API changes will occur. For the moment the <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager</span> works only with the GTK3 and Tk backends. Make sure you use one of those. Port for the rest of the backends is coming soon.

To activate the <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager</span> include the following at the top of your file :

    >>> matplotlib.rcParams['toolbar'] = 'toolmanager'

</div>

### Interact with the ToolContainer

The most important feature is the ability to easily reconfigure the ToolContainer (aka toolbar). For example, if we want to remove the "forward" button we would just do. :

    >>> fig.canvas.manager.toolmanager.remove_tool('forward')

Now if you want to programmatically trigger the "home" button :

    >>> fig.canvas.manager.toolmanager.trigger_tool('home')

### New Tools for ToolManager

It is possible to add new tools to the ToolManager

A very simple tool that prints "You're awesome" would be:

    from matplotlib.backend_tools import ToolBase
    class AwesomeTool(ToolBase):
        def trigger(self, *args, **kwargs):
            print("You're awesome")

To add this tool to <span class="title-ref">.ToolManager</span>

> \>\>\> fig.canvas.manager.toolmanager.add\_tool('Awesome', AwesomeTool)

If we want to add a shortcut ("d") for the tool

> \>\>\> fig.canvas.manager.toolmanager.update\_keymap('Awesome', 'd')

To add it to the toolbar inside the group 'foo'

> \>\>\> fig.canvas.manager.toolbar.add\_tool('Awesome', 'foo')

There is a second class of tools, "Toggleable Tools", this are almost the same as our basic tools, just that belong to a group, and are mutually exclusive inside that group. For tools derived from <span class="title-ref">.ToolToggleBase</span> there are two basic methods <span class="title-ref">\~.ToolToggleBase.enable</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.ToolToggleBase.disable</span> that are called automatically whenever it is toggled.

A full example is located in \[/gallery/user\_interfaces/toolmanager\_sgskip\](/gallery/user\_interfaces/toolmanager\_sgskip.md)

## cbook.is\_sequence\_of\_strings recognizes string objects

This is primarily how pandas stores a sequence of strings :

    import pandas as pd
    import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
    
    a = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    print(cbook.is_sequence_of_strings(a))  # True
    
    a = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c'], dtype=object)
    print(cbook.is_sequence_of_strings(a))  # True
    
    s = pd.Series(['a', 'b', 'c'])
    print(cbook.is_sequence_of_strings(s))  # True

Previously, the last two prints returned false.

## New `close-figs` argument for plot directive

Matplotlib has a sphinx extension `plot_directive` that creates plots for inclusion in sphinx documents. Matplotlib 1.5 adds a new option to the plot directive - `close-figs` - that closes any previous figure windows before creating the plots. This can help avoid some surprising duplicates of plots when using `plot_directive`.

## Support for URL string arguments to `imread`

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imread</span> function now accepts URL strings that point to remote PNG files. This circumvents the generation of a HTTPResponse object directly.

## Display hook for animations in the IPython notebook

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.Animation</span> instances gained a `_repr_html_` method to support inline display of animations in the notebook. The method used to display is controlled by the `animation.html` rc parameter, which currently supports values of `none` and `html5`. `none` is the default, performing no display. `html5` converts the animation to an h264 encoded video, which is embedded directly in the notebook.

Users not wishing to use the `_repr_html_` display hook can also manually call the <span class="title-ref">.to\_html5\_video</span> method to get the HTML and display using IPython's `HTML` display class:

    from IPython.display import HTML
    HTML(anim.to_html5_video())

## Prefixed pkg-config for building

Handling of pkg-config has been fixed in so far as it is now possible to set it using the environment variable `PKG_CONFIG`. This is important if your toolchain is prefixed. This is done in a simpilar way as setting `CC` or `CXX` before building. An example follows:

    export PKG_CONFIG=x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-pkg-config

# What's new in Matplotlib 2.0 (Jan 17, 2017)

\> **Note** \> Matplotlib 2.0 supports Python 2.7, and 3.4+

## Default style changes

The major changes in v2.0 are related to overhauling the default styles.

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

dflt\_style\_changes

</div>

## Improved color conversion API and RGBA support

The `~matplotlib.colors` gained a new color conversion API with full support for the alpha channel. The main public functions are <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.is\_color\_like</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.to\_rgba</span>, <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.to\_rgba\_array</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors.to\_hex</span>. RGBA quadruplets are encoded in hex format as "\#rrggbbaa".

A side benefit is that the Qt options editor now allows setting the alpha channel of the artists as well.

## New Configuration (rcParams)

New rcparams added

### Added `svg.hashsalt` key to rcParams

If `svg.hashsalt` is `None` (which it is by default), the svg backend uses `uuid4` to generate the hash salt. If it is not `None`, it must be a string that is used as the hash salt instead of `uuid4`. This allows for deterministic SVG output.

### Removed the `svg.image_noscale` rcParam

As a result of the extensive changes to image handling, the `svg.image_noscale` rcParam has been removed. The same functionality may be achieved by setting `interpolation='none'` on individual images or globally using the `image.interpolation` rcParam.

## Qualitative colormaps

ColorBrewer's "qualitative" colormaps ("Accent", "Dark2", "Paired", "Pastel1", "Pastel2", "Set1", "Set2", "Set3") were intended for discrete categorical data, with no implication of value, and therefore have been converted to `ListedColormap` instead of `LinearSegmentedColormap`, so the colors will no longer be interpolated and they can be used for choropleths, labeled image features, etc.

## Axis offset label now responds to *labelcolor*

Axis offset labels are now colored the same as axis tick markers when *labelcolor* is altered.

## Improved offset text choice

The default offset-text choice was changed to only use significant digits that are common to all ticks (e.g. 1231..1239 -\> 1230, instead of 1231), except when they straddle a relatively large multiple of a power of ten, in which case that multiple is chosen (e.g. 1999..2001-\>2000).

## Style parameter blacklist

In order to prevent unexpected consequences from using a style, style files are no longer able to set parameters that affect things unrelated to style. These parameters include:

    'interactive', 'backend', 'backend.qt4', 'webagg.port',
    'webagg.port_retries', 'webagg.open_in_browser', 'backend_fallback',
    'toolbar', 'timezone', 'datapath', 'figure.max_open_warning',
    'savefig.directory', 'tk.window_focus', 'docstring.hardcopy'

## Change in default font

The default font used by matplotlib in text has been changed to DejaVu Sans and DejaVu Serif for the sans-serif and serif families, respectively. The DejaVu font family is based on the previous matplotlib default --Bitstream Vera-- but includes a much wider range of characters.

The default mathtext font has been changed from Computer Modern to the DejaVu family to maintain consistency with regular text. Two new options for the `mathtext.fontset` configuration parameter have been added: `dejavusans` (default) and `dejavuserif`. Both of these options use DejaVu glyphs whenever possible and fall back to STIX symbols when a glyph is not found in DejaVu. To return to the previous behavior, set the rcParam `mathtext.fontset` to `cm`.

## Faster text rendering

Rendering text in the Agg backend is now less fuzzy and about 20% faster to draw.

## Improvements for the Qt figure options editor

Various usability improvements were implemented for the Qt figure options editor, among which:

  - Line style entries are now sorted without duplicates.
  - The colormap and normalization limits can now be set for images.
  - Line edits for floating values now display only as many digits as necessary to avoid precision loss. An important bug was also fixed regarding input validation using Qt5 and a locale where the decimal separator is ",".
  - The axes selector now uses shorter, more user-friendly names for axes, and does not crash if there are no axes.
  - Line and image entries using the default labels ("\_lineX", "\_imageX") are now sorted numerically even when there are more than 10 entries.

## Improved image support

Prior to version 2.0, matplotlib resampled images by first applying the colormap and then resizing the result. Since the resampling was performed on the colored image, this introduced colors in the output image that didn't actually exist in the colormap. Now, images are resampled first (and entirely in floating-point, if the input image is floating-point), and then the colormap is applied.

In order to make this important change, the image handling code was almost entirely rewritten. As a side effect, image resampling uses less memory and fewer datatype conversions than before.

The experimental private feature where one could "skew" an image by setting the private member `_image_skew_coordinate` has been removed. Instead, images will obey the transform of the axes on which they are drawn.

### Non-linear scales on image plots

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.imshow</span> now draws data at the requested points in data space after the application of non-linear scales.

The image on the left demonstrates the new, correct behavior. The old behavior can be recreated using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> as demonstrated on the right.

<div class="plot">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.arange(30).reshape(5, 6) x = np.linspace(0, 6, 7) y = 10\*\*np.linspace(0, 5, 6) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y)

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(8, 4))

ax1.imshow(data, aspect="auto", extent=(0, 6, 1e0, 1e5), interpolation='nearest') ax1.set\_yscale('log') ax1.set\_title('Using ax.imshow')

ax2.pcolormesh(x, y, np.flipud(data)) ax2.set\_yscale('log') ax2.set\_title('Using ax.pcolormesh') ax2.autoscale('tight')

plt.show()

</div>

This can be understood by analogy to plotting a histogram with linearly spaced bins with a logarithmic x-axis. Equal sized bins will be displayed as wider for small *x* and narrower for large *x*.

## Support for HiDPI (Retina) displays in the NbAgg and WebAgg backends

The NbAgg and WebAgg backends will now use the full resolution of your high-pixel-density display.

## Change in the default animation codec

The default animation codec has been changed from `mpeg4` to `h264`, which is more efficient. It can be set via the `animation.codec` rcParam.

## Deprecated support for mencoder in animation

The use of mencoder for writing video files with mpl is problematic; switching to ffmpeg is strongly advised. All support for mencoder will be removed in version 2.2.

## Boxplot Zorder Keyword Argument

The *zorder* parameter now exists for <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span>. This allows the zorder of a boxplot to be set in the plotting function call. :

    boxplot(np.arange(10), zorder=10)

## Filled `+` and `x` markers

New fillable *plus* and *x* markers have been added. See the `~matplotlib.markers` module and \[marker reference \</gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/marker\_reference\>\](marker reference \</gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/marker\_reference\>.md) examples.

## *rcount* and *ccount* for <span class="title-ref">\~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span>

As of v2.0, mplot3d's <span class="title-ref">\~.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span> now accepts *rcount* and *ccount* arguments for controlling the sampling of the input data for plotting. These arguments specify the maximum number of evenly spaced samples to take from the input data. These arguments are also the new default sampling method for the function, and is considered a style change.

The old *rstride* and *cstride* arguments, which specified the size of the evenly spaced samples, become the default when 'classic' mode is invoked, and are still available for use. There are no plans for deprecating these arguments.

## Streamplot Zorder Keyword Argument Changes

The `zorder` parameter for <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.streamplot</span> now has default value of `None` instead of `2`. If `None` is given as `zorder`, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.streamplot</span> has a default `zorder` of `matplotlib.lines.Line2D.zorder`.

## Extension to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span>

To support standardizing hatch behavior across the backends we ship the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase.get\_hatch\_color</span> method as added to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span>. This is only used during the render process in the backends we ship so will not break any third-party backends.

If you maintain a third-party backend which extends <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backend\_bases.GraphicsContextBase</span> this method is now available to you and should be used to color hatch patterns.

# What's new in Matplotlib 2.1.0 (Oct 7, 2017)

## Documentation

The examples have been migrated to use [sphinx gallery](https://sphinx-gallery.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). This allows better mixing of prose and code in the examples, provides links to download the examples as both a Python script and a Jupyter notebook, and improves the thumbnail galleries. The examples have been re-organized into \[tutorials\](\#tutorials) and a \[gallery\](\#gallery).

Many docstrings and examples have been clarified and improved.

## New features

### String categorical values

All plotting functions now support string categorical values as input. For example:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" data-align="center">

data = {'apples': 10, 'oranges': 15, 'lemons': 5, 'limes': 20} fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.bar(data.keys(), data.values(), color='lightgray')

</div>

### Interactive JS widgets for animation

Jake Vanderplas' JSAnimation package has been merged into Matplotlib. This adds to Matplotlib the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.HTMLWriter</span> class for generating a JavaScript HTML animation, suitable for the IPython notebook. This can be activated by default by setting the `animation.html` rc parameter to `jshtml`. One can also call the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.Animation.to\_jshtml</span> method to manually convert an animation. This can be displayed using IPython's `HTML` display class:

    from IPython.display import HTML
    HTML(animation.to_jshtml())

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.HTMLWriter</span> class can also be used to generate an HTML file by asking for the `html` writer.

### Enhancements to polar plot

The polar axes transforms have been greatly re-factored to allow for more customization of view limits and tick labelling. Additional options for view limits allow for creating an annulus, a sector, or some combination of the two.

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes.set\_rorigin</span> method may be used to provide an offset to the minimum plotting radius, producing an annulus.

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes.set\_theta\_zero\_location</span> method now has an optional `offset` argument. This argument may be used to further specify the zero location based on the given anchor point.

![Polar Offset Demo](/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/images/sphx_glr_polar_scatter_002.png)

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes.set\_thetamin</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.projections.polar.PolarAxes.set\_thetamax</span> methods may be used to limit the range of angles plotted, producing sectors of a circle.

![Polar Sector Demo](/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/images/sphx_glr_polar_scatter_003.png)

Previous releases allowed plots containing negative radii for which the negative values are simply used as labels, and the real radius is shifted by the configured minimum. This release also allows negative radii to be used for grids and ticks, which were previously silently ignored.

Radial ticks have been modified to be parallel to the circular grid line, and angular ticks have been modified to be parallel to the grid line. It may also be useful to rotate tick *labels* to match the boundary. Calling `ax.tick_params(rotation='auto')` will enable the new behavior: radial tick labels will be parallel to the circular grid line, and angular tick labels will be perpendicular to the grid line (i.e., parallel to the outer boundary). Additionally, tick labels now obey the padding settings that previously only worked on Cartesian plots. Consequently, the `frac` argument to <span class="title-ref">.PolarAxes.set\_thetagrids</span> is no longer applied. Tick padding can be modified with the `pad` argument to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span> or <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span>.

### `Figure` class now has `subplots` method

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure</span> class now has a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.subplots</span> method which behaves the same as <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplots</span> but on an existing figure.

### Metadata savefig keyword argument

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.savefig</span> now accepts `metadata` as a keyword argument. It can be used to store key/value pairs in the image metadata.

  - 'png' with Agg backend
  - 'pdf' with PDF backend (see <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf.PdfFile.writeInfoDict</span> for a list of supported keywords)
  - 'eps' and 'ps' with PS backend (only 'Creator' key is accepted)

<!-- end list -->

    plt.savefig('test.png', metadata={'Software': 'My awesome software'})

### Busy Cursor

The interactive GUI backends will now change the cursor to busy when Matplotlib is rendering the canvas.

### PolygonSelector

A <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.PolygonSelector</span> class has been added to `matplotlib.widgets`. See \[/gallery/widgets/polygon\_selector\_demo\](/gallery/widgets/polygon\_selector\_demo.md) for details.

### Added <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.ticker.PercentFormatter</span>

The new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.PercentFormatter</span> formatter has some nice features like being able to convert from arbitrary data scales to percents, a customizable percent symbol and either automatic or manual control over the decimal points.

### Reproducible PS, PDF and SVG output

The `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` environment variable can now be used to set the timestamp value in the PS and PDF outputs. See [source date epoch](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/).

Alternatively, calling `savefig` with `metadata={'CreationDate': None}` will omit the timestamp altogether for the PDF backend.

The reproducibility of the output from the PS and PDF backends has so far been tested using various plot elements but only default values of options such as `{ps,pdf}.fonttype` that can affect the output at a low level, and not with the mathtext or usetex features. When Matplotlib calls external tools (such as PS distillers or LaTeX) their versions need to be kept constant for reproducibility, and they may add sources of nondeterminism outside the control of Matplotlib.

For SVG output, the `svg.hashsalt` rc parameter has been added in an earlier release. This parameter changes some random identifiers in the SVG file to be deterministic. The downside of this setting is that if more than one file is generated using deterministic identifiers and they end up as parts of one larger document, the identifiers can collide and cause the different parts to affect each other.

These features are now enabled in the tests for the PDF and SVG backends, so most test output files (but not all of them) are now deterministic.

### Orthographic projection for mplot3d

<span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D</span> now accepts `proj_type` keyword argument and has a method <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.set\_proj\_type</span>. The default option is `'persp'` as before, and supplying `'ortho'` enables orthographic view.

Compare the z-axis which is vertical in orthographic view, but slightly skewed in the perspective view.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" data-align="center">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 6)) ax1 = fig.add\_subplot(2, 1, 1, projection='3d') ax1.set\_proj\_type('persp') ax1.set\_title('Perspective (default)')

ax2 = fig.add\_subplot(2, 1, 2, projection='3d') ax2.set\_proj\_type('ortho') ax2.set\_title('Orthographic')

plt.show()

</div>

### `voxels` function for mplot3d

<span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D</span> now has a <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.voxels</span> method, for visualizing boolean 3D data. Uses could include plotting a sparse 3D heat map, or visualizing a volumetric model.

![Voxel Demo](/gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_voxels_numpy_logo_001.png)

## Improvements

### CheckButtons widget `get_status` function

A <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.CheckButtons.get\_status</span> method has been added to the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.widgets.CheckButtons</span> class. This `get_status` method allows user to query the status (True/False) of all of the buttons in the `CheckButtons` object.

### Add `fill_bar` argument to `AnchoredSizeBar`

The `mpl_toolkits` class <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.anchored\_artists.AnchoredSizeBar</span> now has an additional `fill_bar` argument, which makes the size bar a solid rectangle instead of just drawing the border of the rectangle. The default is `None`, and whether or not the bar will be filled by default depends on the value of `size_vertical`. If `size_vertical` is nonzero, `fill_bar` will be set to `True`. If `size_vertical` is zero then `fill_bar` will be set to `False`. If you wish to override this default behavior, set `fill_bar` to `True` or `False` to unconditionally always or never use a filled patch rectangle for the size bar.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" data-align="center">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.anchored\_artists import AnchoredSizeBar

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(3, 3))

  - bar0 = AnchoredSizeBar(ax.transData, 0.3, 'unfilled', loc='lower left',  
    frameon=False, size\_vertical=0.05, fill\_bar=False)

ax.add\_artist(bar0) bar1 = AnchoredSizeBar(ax.transData, 0.3, 'filled', loc='lower right', frameon=False, size\_vertical=0.05, fill\_bar=True) ax.add\_artist(bar1)

plt.show()

</div>

### Annotation can use a default arrow style

Annotations now use the default arrow style when setting `arrowprops={}`, rather than no arrow (the new behavior actually matches the documentation).

### Barbs and Quiver Support Dates

When using the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.quiver</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.barbs</span> plotting methods, it is now possible to pass dates, just like for other methods like <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>. This also allows these functions to handle values that need unit-conversion applied.

### Hexbin default line color

The default `linecolor` keyword argument for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.hexbin</span> is now `'face'`, and supplying `'none'` now prevents lines from being drawn around the hexagons.

### Figure.legend() can be called without arguments

Calling <span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span> can now be done with no arguments. In this case a legend will be created that contains all the artists on all the axes contained within the figure.

### Multiple legend keys for legend entries

A legend entry can now contain more than one legend key. The extended <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.legend\_handler.HandlerTuple</span> class now accepts two parameters: `ndivide` divides the legend area in the specified number of sections; `pad` changes the padding between the legend keys.

![Multiple Legend Keys](/gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/images/sphx_glr_legend_demo_004.png)

### New parameter *clear* for <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span>

When the pyplot's function <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span> is called with a `num` parameter, a new window is only created if no existing window with the same value exists. A new bool parameter *clear* was added for explicitly clearing its existing contents. This is particularly useful when utilized in interactive sessions. Since <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span> also accepts keyword arguments from <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span>, it can also be used there:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    fig0 = plt.figure(num=1)
    fig0.suptitle("A fancy plot")
    print("fig0.texts: ", [t.get_text() for t in fig0.texts])
    
    fig1 = plt.figure(num=1, clear=False)  # do not clear contents of window
    fig1.text(0.5, 0.5, "Really fancy!")
    print("fig0 is fig1: ",  fig0 is fig1)
    print("fig1.texts: ", [t.get_text() for t in fig1.texts])
    
    fig2, ax2 = plt.subplots(2, 1, num=1, clear=True)  # clear contents
    print("fig0 is fig2: ",  fig0 is fig2)
    print("fig2.texts: ", [t.get_text() for t in fig2.texts])
    
    # The output:
    # fig0.texts:  ['A fancy plot']
    # fig0 is fig1:  True
    # fig1.texts:  ['A fancy plot', 'Really fancy!']
    # fig0 is fig2:  True
    # fig2.texts:  []

### Specify minimum value to format as scalar for `LogFormatterMathtext`

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.LogFormatterMathtext</span> now includes the option to specify a minimum value exponent to format as a scalar (i.e., 0.001 instead of 10<sup>-3</sup>).

### New quiverkey angle keyword argument

Plotting a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.quiverkey</span> now admits the `angle` keyword argument, which sets the angle at which to draw the key arrow.

### Colormap reversed method

The methods <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.LinearSegmentedColormap.reversed</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.ListedColormap.reversed</span> return a reversed instance of the Colormap. This implements a way for any Colormap to be reversed.

### <span class="title-ref">.artist.setp</span> (and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.setp</span>) accept a *file* argument

The argument is keyword-only. It allows an output file other than <span class="title-ref">sys.stdout</span> to be specified. It works exactly like the *file* argument to <span class="title-ref">print</span>.

### `streamplot` streamline generation more configurable

The starting point, direction, and length of the stream lines can now be configured. This allows to follow the vector field for a longer time and can enhance the visibility of the flow pattern in some use cases.

### `Axis.set_tick_params` now responds to *rotation*

Bulk setting of tick label rotation is now possible via <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span> using the *rotation* keyword.

    ax.tick_params(which='both', rotation=90)

### Ticklabels are turned off instead of being invisible

Internally, the <span class="title-ref">.Tick</span>'s `matplotlib.axis.Tick.label1On` attribute is now used to hide tick labels instead of setting the visibility on the tick label objects. This improves overall performance and fixes some issues. As a consequence, in case those labels ought to be shown, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.tick\_params</span> needs to be used, e.g.

    ax.tick_params(labelbottom=True)

### Shading in 3D bar plots

A new `shade` parameter has been added the 3D <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.bar</span> plotting method. The default behavior remains to shade the bars, but now users have the option of setting `shade` to `False`.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" data-align="center">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import Axes3D

x = np.arange(2) y = np.arange(3) x2d, y2d = np.meshgrid(x, y) x, y = x2d.ravel(), y2d.ravel() z = np.zeros\_like(x) dz = x + y

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 6)) ax1 = fig.add\_subplot(2, 1, 1, projection='3d') ax1.bar3d(x, y, z, 1, 1, dz, shade=True) ax1.set\_title('Shading On')

ax2 = fig.add\_subplot(2, 1, 2, projection='3d') ax2.bar3d(x, y, z, 1, 1, dz, shade=False) ax2.set\_title('Shading Off')

plt.show()

</div>

### New `which` Parameter for `autofmt_xdate`

A `which` parameter now exists for the method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.figure.Figure.autofmt\_xdate</span>. This allows a user to format `major`, `minor` or `both` tick labels selectively. The default behavior will rotate and align the `major` tick labels.

    fig.autofmt_xdate(bottom=0.2, rotation=30, ha='right', which='minor')

### New Figure Parameter for `subplot2grid`

A `fig` parameter now exists for the function <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplot2grid</span>. This allows a user to specify the figure where the subplots will be created. If `fig` is `None` (default) then the method will use the current figure retrieved by <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.gcf</span>.

    subplot2grid(shape, loc, rowspan=1, colspan=1, fig=myfig)

### Interpolation in `fill_betweenx`

The `interpolate` parameter now exists for the method <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill\_betweenx</span>. This allows a user to interpolate the data and fill the areas in the crossover points, similarly to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.fill\_between</span>.

### New keyword argument `sep` for EngFormatter

A new `sep` keyword argument has been added to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.ticker.EngFormatter</span> and provides a means to define the string that will be used between the value and its unit. The default string is `" "`, which preserves the former behavior. Additionally, the separator is now present between the value and its unit even in the absence of SI prefix. There was formerly a bug that was causing strings like `"3.14V"` to be returned instead of the expected `"3.14 V"` (with the default behavior).

### Extend `MATPLOTLIBRC` behavior

The environmental variable can now specify the full file path or the path to a directory containing a `matplotlibrc` file.

### `density` kwarg to hist

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.hist</span> method now prefers `density` to `normed` to control if the histogram should be normalized, following a change upstream to NumPy. This will reduce confusion as the behavior has always been that the integral of the histogram is 1 (rather than sum or maximum value).

## Internals

### New TransformedPatchPath caching object

A newly added <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.TransformedPatchPath</span> provides a means to transform a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Patch</span> into a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.path.Path</span> via a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Transform</span> while caching the resulting path. If neither the patch nor the transform have changed, a cached copy of the path is returned.

This class differs from the older <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.TransformedPath</span> in that it is able to refresh itself based on the underlying patch while the older class uses an immutable path.

### Abstract base class for movie writers

The new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.AbstractMovieWriter</span> class defines the API required by a class that is to be used as the `writer` in the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.animation.Animation.save</span> method. The existing <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.animation.MovieWriter</span> class now derives from the new abstract base class.

### Stricter validation of line style rcParams

The validation of rcParams that are related to line styles (`lines.linestyle`, `boxplot.*.linestyle`, `grid.linestyle` and `contour.negative_linestyle`) now effectively checks that the values are valid line styles. Strings like `'dashed'` or `'--'` are accepted, as well as even-length sequences of on-off ink like `[1, 1.65]`. In this latter case, the offset value is handled internally and should *not* be provided by the user.

The new validation scheme replaces the former one used for the `contour.negative_linestyle` rcParams, that was limited to `'solid'` and `'dashed'` line styles.

The validation is case-insensitive. The following are now valid:

    grid.linestyle             : (1, 3)   # loosely dotted grid lines
    contour.negative_linestyle : dashdot  # previously only solid or dashed

### pytest

The automated tests have been switched from [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/) to [pytest](https://pytest.org).

## Performance

### Path simplification updates

Line simplification controlled by the `path.simplify` and `path.simplify_threshold` parameters has been improved. You should notice better rendering performance when plotting large amounts of data (as long as the above parameters are set accordingly). Only the line segment portion of paths will be simplified -- if you are also drawing markers and experiencing problems with rendering speed, you should consider using the `markevery` option to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.plot</span>. See the \[performance\](\#performance) section in the usage tutorial for more information.

The simplification works by iteratively merging line segments into a single vector until the next line segment's perpendicular distance to the vector (measured in display-coordinate space) is greater than the `path.simplify_threshold` parameter. Thus, higher values of `path.simplify_threshold` result in quicker rendering times. If you are plotting just to explore data and not for publication quality, pixel perfect plots, then a value of `1.0` can be safely used. If you want to make sure your plot reflects your data *exactly*, then you should set `path.simplify` to false and/or `path.simplify_threshold` to `0`. Matplotlib currently defaults to a conservative value of `1/9`, smaller values are unlikely to cause any visible differences in your plots.

### Implement intersects\_bbox in c++

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.path.Path.intersects\_bbox</span> has been implemented in c++ which improves the performance of automatically placing the legend.

# What's new in Matplotlib 2.2 (Mar 06, 2018)

## Constrained Layout Manager

\> **Warning** \> Constrained Layout is **experimental**. The behaviour and API are subject to change, or the whole functionality may be removed without a deprecation period.

A new method to automatically decide spacing between subplots and their organizing `GridSpec` instances has been added. It is meant to replace the venerable `tight_layout` method. It is invoked via a new `constrained_layout=True` kwarg to <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.subplots</span>.

There are new <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span> for this package, and spacing can be more finely tuned with the new <span class="title-ref">\~.set\_constrained\_layout\_pads</span>.

Features include:

  - Automatic spacing for subplots with a fixed-size padding in inches around subplots and all their decorators, and space between as a fraction of subplot size between subplots.
  - Spacing for <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.suptitle</span>, and colorbars that are attached to more than one axes.
  - Nested <span class="title-ref">\~.GridSpec</span> layouts using <span class="title-ref">\~.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec</span>.

For more details and capabilities please see the new tutorial: \[constrainedlayout\_guide\](\#constrainedlayout\_guide)

Note the new API to access this:

### New `plt.figure` and `plt.subplots` kwarg: `constrained_layout`

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.figure</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.subplots</span> can now be called with `constrained_layout=True` kwarg to enable constrained\_layout.

### New `ax.set_position` behaviour

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_position</span> now makes the specified axis no longer responsive to `constrained_layout`, consistent with the idea that the user wants to place an axis manually.

Internally, this means that old `ax.set_position` calls *inside* the library are changed to private `ax._set_position` calls so that `constrained_layout` will still work with these axes.

### New `figure` kwarg for `GridSpec`

In order to facilitate `constrained_layout`, `GridSpec` now accepts a `figure` keyword. This is backwards compatible, in that not supplying this will simply cause `constrained_layout` to not operate on the subplots organized by this `GridSpec` instance. Routines that use `GridSpec` (e.g. `fig.subplots`) have been modified to pass the figure to `GridSpec`.

## xlabels and ylabels can now be automatically aligned

Subplot axes `ylabels` can be misaligned horizontally if the tick labels are very different widths. The same can happen to `xlabels` if the ticklabels are rotated on one subplot (for instance). The new methods on the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> class: <span class="title-ref">.Figure.align\_xlabels</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Figure.align\_ylabels</span> will now align these labels horizontally or vertically. If the user only wants to align some axes, a list of axes can be passed. If no list is passed, the algorithm looks at all the labels on the figure.

Only labels that have the same subplot locations are aligned. i.e. the ylabels are aligned only if the subplots are in the same column of the subplot layout.

Alignment is persistent and automatic after these are called.

A convenience wrapper <span class="title-ref">.Figure.align\_labels</span> calls both functions at once.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.gridspec as gridspec

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(5, 3), tight\_layout=True) gs = gridspec.GridSpec(2, 2)

ax = fig.add\_subplot(gs\[0,:\]) ax.plot(np.arange(0, 1e6, 1000)) ax.set\_ylabel('Test') for i in range(2): ax = fig.add\_subplot(gs\[1, i\]) ax.set\_ylabel('Booooo') ax.set\_xlabel('Hello') if i == 0: for tick in ax.get\_xticklabels(): tick.set\_rotation(45) fig.align\_labels()

</div>

## Axes legends now included in tight\_bbox

Legends created via `ax.legend` can sometimes overspill the limits of the axis. Tools like `fig.tight_layout()` and `fig.savefig(bbox_inches='tight')` would clip these legends. A change was made to include them in the `tight` calculations.

## Cividis colormap

A new dark blue/yellow colormap named 'cividis' was added. Like viridis, cividis is perceptually uniform and colorblind friendly. However, cividis also goes a step further: not only is it usable by colorblind users, it should actually look effectively identical to colorblind and non-colorblind users. For more details see [Nuñez J, Anderton C, and Renslow R: "Optimizing colormaps with consideration for color vision deficiency to enable accurate interpretation of scientific data"](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0199239).

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots() pcm = ax.pcolormesh(np.random.rand(32,32), cmap='cividis') fig.colorbar(pcm)

</div>

## New style colorblind-friendly color cycle

A new style defining a color cycle has been added, tableau-colorblind10, to provide another option for colorblind-friendly plots. A demonstration of this new style can be found in the [reference](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/style_sheets/style_sheets_reference.html) of style sheets. To load this color cycle in place of the default one:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('tableau-colorblind10')

## Support for numpy.datetime64

Matplotlib has supported <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime</span> dates for a long time in <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.dates</span>. We now support <span class="title-ref">numpy.datetime64</span> dates as well. Anywhere that <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime</span> could be used, <span class="title-ref">numpy.datetime64</span> can be used. eg:

    time = np.arange('2005-02-01', '2005-02-02', dtype='datetime64[h]')
    plt.plot(time)

## Writing animations with Pillow

It is now possible to use Pillow as an animation writer. Supported output formats are currently gif (Pillow\>=3.4) and webp (Pillow\>=5.0). Use e.g. as :

    from __future__ import division
    
    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    from matplotlib.animation import FuncAnimation, PillowWriter
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    line, = plt.plot([0, 1])
    
    def animate(i):
       line.set_ydata([0, i / 20])
       return [line]
    
    anim = FuncAnimation(fig, animate, 20, blit=True)
    anim.save("movie.gif", writer=PillowWriter(fps=24))
    plt.show()

## Slider UI widget can snap to discrete values

The slider UI widget can take the optional argument *valstep*. Doing so forces the slider to take on only discrete values, starting from *valmin* and counting up to *valmax* with steps of size *valstep*.

If *closedmax==True*, then the slider will snap to *valmax* as well.

## `capstyle` and `joinstyle` attributes added to <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span>

The <span class="title-ref">.Collection</span> class now has customizable `capstyle` and `joinstyle` attributes. This allows the user for example to set the `capstyle` of errorbars.

## *pad* kwarg added to ax.set\_title

The method <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_title</span> now has a *pad* kwarg, that specifies the distance from the top of an axes to where the title is drawn. The units of *pad* is points, and the default is the value of the (already-existing) `axes.titlepad`.

## Comparison of 2 colors in Matplotlib

As the colors in Matplotlib can be specified with a wide variety of ways, the <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.same\_color</span> method has been added which checks if two <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.colors</span> are the same.

## Autoscaling a polar plot snaps to the origin

Setting the limits automatically in a polar plot now snaps the radial limit to zero if the automatic limit is nearby. This means plotting from zero doesn't automatically scale to include small negative values on the radial axis.

The limits can still be set manually in the usual way using <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_ylim</span>.

## PathLike support

On Python 3.6+, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.savefig</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imsave</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.pyplot.imread</span>, and animation writers now accept <span class="title-ref">os.PathLike</span>s as input.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span> can set gridline properties

<span class="title-ref">.Tick</span> objects hold gridlines as well as the tick mark and its label. <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_tick\_params</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.tick\_params</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.tick\_params</span> now have keyword arguments 'grid\_color', 'grid\_alpha', 'grid\_linewidth', and 'grid\_linestyle' for overriding the defaults in \`.rcParams\`: 'grid.color', etc.

## <span class="title-ref">.Axes.imshow</span> clips RGB values to the valid range

When <span class="title-ref">.Axes.imshow</span> is passed an RGB or RGBA value with out-of-range values, it now logs a warning and clips them to the valid range. The old behaviour, wrapping back in to the range, often hid outliers and made interpreting RGB images unreliable.

## Properties in `matplotlibrc` to place xaxis and yaxis tick labels

Introducing four new boolean properties in `matplotlibrc` for default positions of xaxis and yaxis tick labels, namely, `xtick.labeltop`, `xtick.labelbottom`, `ytick.labelright` and `ytick.labelleft`. These can also be changed in rcParams.

## PGI bindings for gtk3

The GTK3 backends can now use [PGI](https://pgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) instead of [PyGObject](https://pygobject.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). PGI is a fairly incomplete binding for GObject, thus its use is not recommended; its main benefit is its availability on Travis (thus allowing CI testing for the gtk3agg and gtk3cairo backends).

The binding selection rules are as follows: - if `gi` has already been imported, use it; else - if `pgi` has already been imported, use it; else - if `gi` can be imported, use it; else - if `pgi` can be imported, use it; else - error out.

Thus, to force usage of PGI when both bindings are installed, import it first.

## Cairo rendering for Qt, WX, and Tk canvases

The new `Qt4Cairo`, `Qt5Cairo`, `WXCairo`, and `TkCairo` backends allow Qt, Wx, and Tk canvases to use Cairo rendering instead of Agg.

## Added support for QT in new ToolManager

Now it is possible to use the ToolManager with Qt5 For example:

    import matplotlib
    
    matplotlib.use('QT5AGG')
    matplotlib.rcParams['toolbar'] = 'toolmanager'
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    plt.plot([1,2,3])
    plt.show()

Treat the new Tool classes experimental for now, the API will likely change and perhaps the rcParam as well

The main example \[/gallery/user\_interfaces/toolmanager\_sgskip\](/gallery/user\_interfaces/toolmanager\_sgskip.md) shows more details, just adjust the header to use QT instead of GTK3

## TkAgg backend reworked to support PyPy

[PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/) can now plot using the TkAgg backend, supported on PyPy 5.9 and greater (both PyPy for python 2.7 and PyPy for python 3.5).

## Python logging library used for debug output

Matplotlib has in the past (sporadically) used an internal verbose-output reporter. This version converts those calls to using the standard python <span class="title-ref">logging</span> library.

Support for the old <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span> `verbose.level` and `verbose.fileo` is dropped.

The command-line options `--verbose-helpful` and `--verbose-debug` are still accepted, but deprecated. They are now equivalent to setting `logging.INFO` and `logging.DEBUG`.

The logger's root name is `matplotlib` and can be accessed from programs as:

    import logging
    mlog = logging.getLogger('matplotlib')

Instructions for basic usage are in \[troubleshooting-faq\](\#troubleshooting-faq) and for developers in \[contributing\](\#contributing).

## Improved <span class="title-ref">repr</span> for <span class="title-ref">.Transform</span>s

<span class="title-ref">.Transform</span>s now indent their <span class="title-ref">repr</span>s in a more legible manner:

`` `ipython In [1]: l, = plt.plot([]); l.get_transform() Out[1]: CompositeGenericTransform(    TransformWrapper(       BlendedAffine2D(             IdentityTransform(),             IdentityTransform())),    CompositeGenericTransform(       BboxTransformFrom(             TransformedBbox(                Bbox(x0=-0.05500000000000001, y0=-0.05500000000000001, x1=0.05500000000000001, y1=0.05500000000000001),                TransformWrapper(                   BlendedAffine2D(                         IdentityTransform(),                         IdentityTransform())))),       BboxTransformTo(             TransformedBbox(                Bbox(x0=0.125, y0=0.10999999999999999, x1=0.9, y1=0.88),                BboxTransformTo(                   TransformedBbox(                         Bbox(x0=0.0, y0=0.0, x1=6.4, y1=4.8),                         Affine2D(                            [[ 100.    0.    0.]                            [   0.  100.    0.]                            [   0.    0.    1.]]))))))) ``\`

# What's new in Matplotlib 3.0 (Sep 18, 2018)

## Improved default backend selection

The default backend no longer must be set as part of the build process. Instead, at run time, the builtin backends are tried in sequence until one of them imports.

Headless Linux servers (identified by the DISPLAY environment variable not being defined) will not select a GUI backend.

## Cyclic colormaps

Two new colormaps named 'twilight' and 'twilight\_shifted' have been added. These colormaps start and end on the same color, and have two symmetric halves with equal lightness, but diverging color. Since they wrap around, they are a good choice for cyclic data such as phase angles, compass directions, or time of day. Like *viridis* and *cividis*, *twilight* is perceptually uniform and colorblind friendly.

## Ability to scale axis by a fixed order of magnitude

To scale an axis by a fixed order of magnitude, set the *scilimits* argument of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.ticklabel\_format</span> to the same (non-zero) lower and upper limits. Say to scale the y axis by a million (1e6), use

`` `python   ax.ticklabel_format(style='sci', scilimits=(6, 6), axis='y')  The behavior of ``scilimits=(0, 0)`is unchanged. With this setting, Matplotlib will adjust`<span class="title-ref"> the order of magnitude depending on the axis values, rather than keeping it fixed. Previously, setting </span><span class="title-ref">scilimits=(m, m)</span><span class="title-ref"> was equivalent to setting </span><span class="title-ref">scilimits=(0, 0)</span>\`.

## Add `AnchoredDirectionArrows` feature to mpl\_toolkits

A new mpl\_toolkits class <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.axes\_grid1.anchored\_artists.AnchoredDirectionArrows</span> draws a pair of orthogonal arrows to indicate directions on a 2D plot. A minimal working example takes in the transformation object for the coordinate system (typically ax.transAxes), and arrow labels. There are several optional parameters that can be used to alter layout. For example, the arrow pairs can be rotated and the color can be changed. By default the labels and arrows have the same color, but the class may also pass arguments for customizing arrow and text layout, these are passed to <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.textpath.TextPath</span> and <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.patches.FancyArrowPatch</span>. Location, length and width for both arrow tail and head can be adjusted, the direction arrows and labels can have a frame. Padding and separation parameters can be adjusted.

## Add `minorticks_on()/off()` methods for colorbar

A new method `ColorbarBase.minorticks_on` has been added to correctly display minor ticks on a colorbar. This method doesn't allow the minor ticks to extend into the regions beyond vmin and vmax when the *extend* keyword argument (used while creating the colorbar) is set to 'both', 'max' or 'min'. A complementary method `ColorbarBase.minorticks_off` has also been added to remove the minor ticks on the colorbar.

## Colorbar ticks can now be automatic

The number of ticks placed on colorbars was previously appropriate for a large colorbar, but looked bad if the colorbar was made smaller (i.e. via the *shrink* keyword argument). This has been changed so that the number of ticks is now responsive to how large the colorbar is.

## Don't automatically rename duplicate file names

Previously, when saving a figure to a file using the GUI's save dialog box, if the default filename (based on the figure window title) already existed on disk, Matplotlib would append a suffix (e.g. `Figure_1-1.png`), preventing the dialog from prompting to overwrite the file. This behaviour has been removed. Now if the file name exists on disk, the user is prompted whether or not to overwrite it. This eliminates guesswork, and allows intentional overwriting, especially when the figure name has been manually set using `figure.canvas.set_window_title()`.

## Legend now has a *title\_fontsize* keyword argument (and rcParam)

The title for a <span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.legend</span> can now have its font size set via the *title\_fontsize* keyword argument. There is also a new `legend.title_fontsize`. Both default to `None`, which means the legend title will have the same font size as the axes default font size (*not* the legend font size, set by the *fontsize* keyword argument or `legend.fontsize`).

## Support for axes.prop\_cycle property *markevery* in rcParams

The Matplotlib `rcParams` settings object now supports configuration of the attribute `axes.prop_cycle` with cyclers using the *markevery* Line2D object property.

## Multi-page PDF support for pgf backend

The pgf backend now also supports multi-page PDF files.

`` `python     from matplotlib.backends.backend_pgf import PdfPages     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      with PdfPages('multipage.pdf') as pdf:         # page 1         plt.plot([2, 1, 3])         pdf.savefig()          # page 2         plt.cla()         plt.plot([3, 1, 2])         pdf.savefig()   Pie charts are now circular by default ``<span class="title-ref"> -------------------------------------- We acknowledge that the majority of people do not like egg-shaped pies. Therefore, an axes to which a pie chart is plotted will be set to have equal aspect ratio by default. This ensures that the pie appears circular independent on the axes size or units. To revert to the previous behaviour set the axes' aspect ratio to automatic by using </span><span class="title-ref">ax.set\_aspect("auto")</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">plt.axis("auto")</span>\`.

## Add `ax.get_gridspec` to `SubplotBase`

New method `SubplotBase.get_gridspec` is added so that users can easily get the gridspec that went into making an axes:

`` `python     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 2)     gs = axs[0, -1].get_gridspec()      # remove the last column     for ax in axs[:,-1].flatten():       ax.remove()      # make a subplot in last column that spans rows.     ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[:, -1])     plt.show()   Axes titles will no longer overlap xaxis ``\` ----------------------------------------

Previously an axes title had to be moved manually if an xaxis overlapped (usually when the xaxis was put on the top of the axes). Now, the title will be automatically moved above the xaxis and its decorators (including the xlabel) if they are at the top.

If desired, the title can still be placed manually. There is a slight kludge; the algorithm checks if the y-position of the title is 1.0 (the default), and moves if it is. If the user places the title in the default location (i.e. `ax.title.set_position(0.5, 1.0)`), the title will still be moved above the xaxis. If the user wants to avoid this, they can specify a number that is close (i.e. `ax.title.set_position(0.5, 1.01)`) and the title will not be moved via this algorithm.

## New convenience methods for GridSpec

There are new convenience methods for <span class="title-ref">.gridspec.GridSpec</span> and <span class="title-ref">.gridspec.GridSpecFromSubplotSpec</span>. Instead of the former we can now call <span class="title-ref">.Figure.add\_gridspec</span> and for the latter <span class="title-ref">.SubplotSpec.subgridspec</span>.

`` `python     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      fig = plt.figure()     gs0 = fig.add_gridspec(3, 1)     ax1 = fig.add_subplot(gs0[0])     ax2 = fig.add_subplot(gs0[1])     gssub = gs0[2].subgridspec(1, 3)     for i in range(3):         fig.add_subplot(gssub[0, i])   Figure has an `~.figure.Figure.add_artist` method ``\` -------------------------------------------------

A method <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure.add\_artist</span> has been added to the <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure</span> class, which allows artists to be added directly to a figure. E.g. :

    circ = plt.Circle((.7, .5), .05)
    fig.add_artist(circ)

In case the added artist has no transform set previously, it will be set to the figure transform (`fig.transFigure`). This new method may be useful for adding artists to figures without axes or to easily position static elements in figure coordinates.

## `:math:` directive renamed to `:mathmpl:`

The `:math:` rst role provided by <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl</span> has been renamed to `:mathmpl:` to avoid conflicting with the `:math:` role that Sphinx 1.8 provides by default. (`:mathmpl:` uses Matplotlib to render math expressions to images embedded in html, whereas Sphinx uses MathJax.)

When using Sphinx\<1.8, both names (`:math:` and `:mathmpl:`) remain available for backwards-compatibility.

<div class="contents" data-depth="4">

</div>

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="4">

</div>

## New Features

### <span class="title-ref">\~.dates.ConciseDateFormatter</span>

The automatic date formatter used by default can be quite verbose. A new formatter can be accessed that tries to make the tick labels appropriately concise.

<div class="plot">

import datetime import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.dates as mdates import numpy as np

\# make a timeseries... base = datetime.datetime(2005, 2, 1) dates = np.array(\[base + datetime.timedelta(hours= 2 \* i) for i in range(732)\]) N = len(dates) np.random.seed(19680801) y = np.cumsum(np.random.randn(N))

  - lims = \[(np.datetime64('2005-02'), np.datetime64('2005-04')),  
    (np.datetime64('2005-02-03'), np.datetime64('2005-02-15')), (np.datetime64('2005-02-03 11:00'), np.datetime64('2005-02-04 13:20'))\]

fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, constrained\_layout=True) for nn, ax in enumerate(axs): \# activate the formatter here. locator = mdates.AutoDateLocator() formatter = mdates.ConciseDateFormatter(locator) ax.xaxis.set\_major\_locator(locator) ax.xaxis.set\_major\_formatter(formatter)

> ax.plot(dates, y) ax.set\_xlim(lims\[nn\])

axs\[0\].set\_title('Concise Date Formatter')

plt.show()

</div>

### Secondary x/y Axis support

A new method provides the ability to add a second axis to an existing axes via <span class="title-ref">.Axes.secondary\_xaxis</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.secondary\_yaxis</span>. See \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/secondary\_axis\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/secondary\_axis.md) for examples.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 3)) ax.plot(range(360)) ax.secondary\_xaxis('top', functions=(np.deg2rad, np.rad2deg))

</div>

### <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.FuncScale</span> for arbitrary axes scales

A new <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.FuncScale</span> class was added (and <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.FuncTransform</span>) to allow the user to have arbitrary scale transformations without having to write a new subclass of <span class="title-ref">\~.scale.ScaleBase</span>. This can be accessed by:

    ax.set_yscale('function', functions=(forward, inverse))

where `forward` and `inverse` are callables that return the scale transform and its inverse. See the last example in \[/gallery/scales/scales\](/gallery/scales/scales.md).

### Legend for scatter

A new method for creating legends for scatter plots has been introduced. Previously, in order to obtain a legend for a <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.scatter</span> plot, one could either plot several scatters, each with an individual label, or create proxy artists to show in the legend manually. Now, <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.PathCollection</span> provides a method <span class="title-ref">\~.collections.PathCollection.legend\_elements</span> to obtain the handles and labels for a scatter plot in an automated way. This makes creating a legend for a scatter plot as easy as

<div class="plot">

scatter = plt.scatter(\[1,2,3\], \[4,5,6\], c=\[7,2,3\]) plt.legend(\*scatter.legend\_elements())

</div>

An example can be found in \[automatedlegendcreation\](\#automatedlegendcreation).

### Matplotlib no longer requires framework app build on MacOSX backend

Previous versions of matplotlib required a Framework build of python to work. The app type was updated to no longer require this, so the MacOSX backend should work with non-framework python.

This also adds support for the MacOSX backend for PyPy3.

## Figure, FigureCanvas, and Backends

### Figure.frameon is now a direct proxy for the Figure patch visibility state

Accessing `Figure.frameon` (including via `get_frameon` and `set_frameon` now directly forwards to the visibility of the underlying Rectangle artist (`Figure.patch.get_frameon`, `Figure.patch.set_frameon`).

### *pil\_kwargs* argument added to savefig

Matplotlib uses Pillow to handle saving to the JPEG and TIFF formats. The <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig()</span> function gained a *pil\_kwargs* keyword argument, which can be used to forward arguments to Pillow's <span class="title-ref">PIL.Image.Image.save</span>.

The *pil\_kwargs* argument can also be used when saving to PNG. In that case, Matplotlib also uses Pillow's <span class="title-ref">PIL.Image.Image.save</span> instead of going through its own builtin PNG support.

### Add `inaxes` method to <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase</span>

The <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasBase</span> class has now an <span class="title-ref">\~.FigureCanvasBase.inaxes</span> method to check whether a point is in an axes and returns the topmost axes, else None.

### cairo backend defaults to pycairo instead of cairocffi

This leads to faster import/runtime performance in some cases. The backend will fall back to cairocffi in case pycairo isn't available.

## Axes and Artists

### axes\_grid1 and axisartist Axes no longer draw spines twice

Previously, spines of <span class="title-ref">.axes\_grid1</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axisartist</span> Axes would be drawn twice, leading to a "bold" appearance. This is no longer the case.

### Return type of ArtistInspector.get\_aliases changed

<span class="title-ref">.ArtistInspector.get\_aliases</span> previously returned the set of aliases as `{fullname: {alias1: None, alias2: None, ...}}`. The dict-to-None mapping was used to simulate a set in earlier versions of Python. It has now been replaced by a set, i.e. `{fullname: {alias1, alias2, ...}}`.

This value is also stored in `ArtistInspector.aliasd`, which has likewise changed.

### <span class="title-ref">.ConnectionPatch</span> accepts arbitrary transforms

Alternatively to strings like `"data"` or `"axes fraction"`, <span class="title-ref">.ConnectionPatch</span> now accepts any <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.transforms.Transform</span> as input for the *coordsA* and *coordsB* arguments. This allows to draw lines between points defined in different user defined coordinate systems. Also see \[using\_connectionpatch\](\#using\_connectionpatch).

### mplot3d Line3D now allows {set,get}\_data\_3d

Lines created with the 3d projection in mplot3d can now access the data using <span class="title-ref">\~.mplot3d.art3d.Line3D.get\_data\_3d()</span> which returns a tuple of array\_likes containing the (x, y, z) data. The equivalent <span class="title-ref">\~.mplot3d.art3d.Line3D.set\_data\_3d</span> can be used to modify the data of an existing Line3D.

### `Axes3D.voxels` now shades the resulting voxels

The <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.voxels</span> method now takes a *shade* parameter that defaults to <span class="title-ref">True</span>. This shades faces based on their orientation, behaving just like the matching parameters to <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_trisurf</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.bar3d</span>. The plot below shows how this affects the output.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

\# prepare some coordinates x, y, z = np.indices((8, 8, 8))

\# draw cuboids in the top left and bottom right corners, and a link between them cube1 = (x \< 3) & (y \< 3) & (z \< 3) cube2 = (x \>= 5) & (y \>= 5) & (z \>= 5) link = abs(x - y) + abs(y - z) + abs(z - x) \<= 2

\# combine the objects into a single boolean array voxels = cube1 | cube2 | link

\# set the colors of each object colors = np.empty(voxels.shape, dtype=object) colors\[link\] = 'red' colors\[cube1\] = 'blue' colors\[cube2\] = 'green'

\# and plot everything fig = plt.figure(figsize=plt.figaspect(0.5)) ax, ax\_shaded = fig.subplots(1, 2, subplot\_kw=dict(projection='3d')) ax.voxels(voxels, facecolors=colors, edgecolor='k', shade=False) ax.set\_title("Unshaded") ax\_shaded.voxels(voxels, facecolors=colors, edgecolor='k', shade=True) ax\_shaded.set\_title("Shaded (default)")

plt.show()

</div>

## Axis and Ticks

### Added <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_inverted</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_inverted</span>

The <span class="title-ref">.Axis.get\_inverted</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_inverted</span> methods query and set whether the axis uses "inverted" orientation (i.e. increasing to the left for the x-axis and to the bottom for the y-axis).

They perform tasks similar to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.xaxis\_inverted</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.yaxis\_inverted</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.invert\_xaxis</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.Axes.invert\_yaxis</span>, with the specific difference that <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_inverted</span> makes it easier to set the inversion of an axis regardless of whether it had previously been inverted before.

### Adjust default minor tick spacing

Default minor tick spacing was changed from 0.625 to 0.5 for major ticks spaced 2.5 units apart.

### <span class="title-ref">.EngFormatter</span> now accepts *usetex*, *useMathText* as keyword only arguments

A public API has been added to <span class="title-ref">.EngFormatter</span> to control how the numbers in the ticklabels will be rendered. By default, *useMathText* evaluates to `axes.formatter.use_mathtext` and *usetex* evaluates to `text.usetex`.

If either is <span class="title-ref">True</span> then the numbers will be encapsulated by `$` signs. When using `TeX` this implies that the numbers will be shown in TeX's math font. When using mathtext, the `$` signs around numbers will ensure Unicode rendering (as implied by mathtext). This will make sure that the minus signs in the ticks are rendered as the Unicode minus (U+2212) when using mathtext (without relying on the <span class="title-ref">\~.Formatter.fix\_minus</span> method).

## Animation and Interactivity

### Support for forward/backward mouse buttons

Figure managers now support a `button_press` event for mouse buttons, similar to the `key_press` events. This allows binding actions to mouse buttons (see <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton</span>) The first application of this mechanism is support of forward/backward mouse buttons in figures created with the Qt5 backend.

### *progress\_callback* argument to <span class="title-ref">\~.Animation.save()</span>

The method <span class="title-ref">.Animation.save</span> gained an optional *progress\_callback* argument to notify the saving progress.

### Add `cache_frame_data` keyword-only argument into <span class="title-ref">.animation.FuncAnimation</span>

<span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.animation.FuncAnimation</span> has been caching frame data by default; however, this caching is not ideal in certain cases e.g. When <span class="title-ref">.FuncAnimation</span> needs to be only drawn(not saved) interactively and memory required by frame data is quite large. By adding *cache\_frame\_data* keyword-only argument, users can now disable this caching; thereby, this new argument provides a fix for issue `8528`.

### Endless Looping GIFs with PillowWriter

We acknowledge that most people want to watch a GIF more than once. Saving an animation as a GIF with PillowWriter now produces an endless looping GIF.

### Adjusted <span class="title-ref">.matplotlib.widgets.Slider</span> to have vertical orientation

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.widgets.Slider</span> widget now takes an optional argument *orientation* which indicates the direction (`'horizontal'` or `'vertical'`) that the slider should take.

### Improved formatting of image values under cursor when a colorbar is present

When a colorbar is present, its formatter is now used to format the image values under the mouse cursor in the status bar. For example, for an image displaying the values 10,000 and 10,001, the statusbar will now (using default settings) display the values as `10000` and `10001`), whereas both values were previously displayed as `1e+04`.

### MouseEvent button attribute is now an IntEnum

The `button` attribute of <span class="title-ref">\~.MouseEvent</span> instances can take the values None, 1 (left button), 2 (middle button), 3 (right button), "up" (scroll), and "down" (scroll). For better legibility, the 1, 2, and 3 values are now represented using the <span class="title-ref">enum.IntEnum</span> class <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.backend\_bases.MouseButton</span>, with the values <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton.LEFT</span> (`== 1`), <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton.MIDDLE</span> (`== 2`), and <span class="title-ref">.MouseButton.RIGHT</span> (`== 3`).

## Configuration, Install, and Development

### The MATPLOTLIBRC environment variable can now point to any "file" path

This includes device files; in particular, on Unix systems, one can set `MATPLOTLIBRC` to `/dev/null` to ignore the user's matplotlibrc file and fall back to Matplotlib's defaults.

As a reminder, if `MATPLOTLIBRC` points to a directory, Matplotlib will try to load the matplotlibrc file from `$MATPLOTLIBRC/matplotlibrc`.

### Allow LaTeX code `pgf.preamble` and `text.latex.preamble` in MATPLOTLIBRC file

Previously, the rc file keys `pgf.preamble` and `text.latex.preamble` were parsed using commas as separators. This would break valid LaTeX code, such as:

    \usepackage[protrusion=true, expansion=false]{microtype}

The parsing has been modified to pass the complete line to the LaTeX system, keeping all commas. Passing a list of strings from within a Python script still works as it used to.

### New logging API

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.set\_loglevel</span> / <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.set\_loglevel</span> can be called to display more (or less) detailed logging output.

## Unit converters recognize subclasses

Unit converters now also handle instances of subclasses of the class they have been registered for.

## <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.imsave</span> accepts metadata and PIL options

<span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.imsave</span> has gained support for the `metadata` and `pil_kwargs` parameters. These parameters behave similarly as for the <span class="title-ref">.Figure.savefig()</span> method.

## <span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span>

<span class="title-ref">.cbook.normalize\_kwargs</span> now presents a convenient interface to normalize artist properties (e.g., from "lw" to "linewidth"):

\>\>\> cbook.normalize\_kwargs({"lw": 1}, Line2D) {"linewidth": 1}

The first argument is the mapping to be normalized, and the second argument can be an artist class or an artist instance (it can also be a mapping in a specific format; see the function's docstring for details).

## <span class="title-ref">.FontProperties</span> accepts <span class="title-ref">os.PathLike</span>

The *fname* argument to <span class="title-ref">.FontProperties</span> can now be an <span class="title-ref">os.PathLike</span>, e.g.

\>\>\> FontProperties(fname=pathlib.Path("/path/to/font.ttf"))

## Gouraud-shading alpha channel in PDF backend

The pdf backend now supports an alpha channel in Gouraud-shaded triangle meshes.

## Kerning adjustments now use correct values

Due to an error in how kerning adjustments were applied, previous versions of Matplotlib would under-correct kerning. This version will now correctly apply kerning (for fonts supported by FreeType). To restore the old behavior (e.g., for test images), you may set `text.kerning_factor` to 6 (instead of 0). Other values have undefined behavior.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

\# Use old kerning values: plt.rcParams\['text.kerning\_factor'\] = 6 fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.text(0.0, 0.05, 'BRAVOnAWKWARDnVATnW.Test', fontsize=56) ax.set\_title('Before (text.kerning\_factor = 6)')

</div>

Note how the spacing between characters is uniform between their bounding boxes (above). With corrected kerning (below), slanted characters (e.g., AV or VA) will be spaced closer together, as well as various other character pairs, depending on font support (e.g., T and e, or the period after the W).

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

\# Use new kerning values: plt.rcParams\['text.kerning\_factor'\] = 0 fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.text(0.0, 0.05, 'BRAVOnAWKWARDnVATnW.Test', fontsize=56) ax.set\_title('After (text.kerning\_factor = 0)')

</div>

## bar3d lightsource shading

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes3D.bar3d</span> now supports lighting from different angles when the *shade* parameter is `True`, which can be configured using the `lightsource` parameter.

## Shifting errorbars

Previously, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.errorbar()</span> accepted a keyword argument *errorevery* such that the command `plt.errorbar(x, y, yerr, errorevery=6)` would add error bars to datapoints `x[::6], y[::6]`.

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.errorbar()</span> now also accepts a tuple for *errorevery* such that `plt.errorbar(x, y, yerr, errorevery=(start, N))` adds error bars to points `x[start::N], y[start::N]`.

## Improvements in Logit scale ticker and formatter

Introduced in version 1.5, the logit scale didn't have an appropriate ticker and formatter. Previously, the location of ticks was not zoom dependent, too many labels were displayed causing overlapping which broke readability, and label formatting did not adapt to precision.

Starting from this version, the logit locator has nearly the same behavior as the locator for the log scale or the linear scale, depending on used zoom. The number of ticks is controlled. Some minor labels are displayed adaptively as sublabels in log scale. Formatting is adapted for probabilities and the precision adapts to the scale.

## rcParams for axes title location and color

Two new rcParams have been added: `axes.titlelocation` denotes the default axes title alignment, and `axes.titlecolor` the default axes title color.

Valid values for `axes.titlelocation` are: left, center, and right. Valid values for `axes.titlecolor` are: auto or a color. Setting it to auto will fall back to previous behaviour, which is using the color in `text.color`.

## 3-digit and 4-digit hex colors

Colors can now be specified using 3-digit or 4-digit hex colors, shorthand for the colors obtained by duplicating each character, e.g. `#123` is equivalent to `#112233` and `#123a` is equivalent to `#112233aa`.

## Added support for RGB(A) images in pcolorfast

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.pcolorfast</span> now accepts 3D images (RGB or RGBA) arrays.

## Figure and Axes creation / management

### Provisional API for composing semantic axes layouts from text or nested lists

The <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> class has a provisional method to generate complex grids of named <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes</span> based on nested list input or ASCII art:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

  - axd = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True).subplot\_mosaic(
    
      - \[\['.', 'histx'\],  
        \['histy', 'scat'\]\]

) for k, ax in axd.items(): ax.text(0.5, 0.5, k, ha='center', va='center', fontsize=36, color='darkgrey')

</div>

or as a string (with single-character Axes labels):

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

  - axd = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True).subplot\_mosaic(  
    """ TTE L.E """)

  - for k, ax in axd.items():
    
      - ax.text(0.5, 0.5, k,  
        ha='center', va='center', fontsize=36, color='darkgrey')

</div>

See \[mosaic\](\#mosaic) for more details and examples.

### `GridSpec.subplots()`

The <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> class gained a <span class="title-ref">\~.GridSpecBase.subplots</span> method, so that one can write :

    fig.add_gridspec(2, 2, height_ratios=[3, 1]).subplots()

as an alternative to :

    fig.subplots(2, 2, gridspec_kw={"height_ratios": [3, 1]})

### New `Axes.sharex`, `Axes.sharey` methods

These new methods allow sharing axes *immediately* after creating them. Note that behavior is indeterminate if axes are not shared immediately after creation.

For example, they can be used to selectively link some axes created all together using \`\~.Figure.subplot\_mosaic\`:

    fig = plt.figure(constrained_layout=True)
    axd = fig.subplot_mosaic([['.', 'histx'], ['histy', 'scat']],
                             gridspec_kw={'width_ratios': [1, 7],
                                          'height_ratios': [2, 7]})
    
    axd['histx'].sharex(axd['scat'])
    axd['histy'].sharey(axd['scat'])

<div class="plot">

np.random.seed(0) x = np.random.random(100) \* 100 + 20 y = np.random.random(100) \* 50 + 25 c = np.random.random(100) - 0.5

fig = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True) axd = fig.subplot\_mosaic(\[\['.', 'histx'\], \['histy', 'scat'\]\], gridspec\_kw={'width\_ratios': \[1, 7\], 'height\_ratios': \[2, 7\]})

axd\['histy'\].invert\_xaxis() axd\['histx'\].sharex(axd\['scat'\]) axd\['histy'\].sharey(axd\['scat'\])

im = axd\['scat'\].scatter(x, y, c=c, cmap='RdBu', picker=True) fig.colorbar(im, orientation='horizontal', ax=axd\['scat'\], shrink=0.8)

axd\['histx'\].hist(x) axd\['histy'\].hist(y, orientation='horizontal')

</div>

### tight\_layout now supports suptitle

Previous versions did not consider <span class="title-ref">.Figure.suptitle</span>, so it may overlap with other artists after calling \`\~.Figure.tight\_layout\`:

<div class="plot">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3) for i, ax in enumerate(axs): ax.plot(\[1, 2, 3\]) ax.set\_title(f'Axes {i}')

t = fig.suptitle('suptitle') t.set\_in\_layout(False) fig.tight\_layout()

</div>

From now on, the `suptitle` will be considered:

<div class="plot">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3) for i, ax in enumerate(axs): ax.plot(\[1, 2, 3\]) ax.set\_title(f'Axes {i}')

fig.suptitle('suptitle') fig.tight\_layout()

</div>

### Setting axes box aspect

It is now possible to set the aspect of an axes box directly via <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.set\_box\_aspect</span>. The box aspect is the ratio between axes height and axes width in physical units, independent of the data limits. This is useful to, e.g., produce a square plot, independent of the data it contains, or to have a non-image plot with the same axes dimensions next to an image plot with fixed (data-)aspect.

For use cases check out the \[Axes box aspect \</gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/axes\_box\_aspect\>\](Axes box aspect \</gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/axes\_box\_aspect\>.md) example.

## Colors and colormaps

### Turbo colormap

Turbo is an improved rainbow colormap for visualization, created by the Google AI team for computer vision and machine learning. Its purpose is to display depth and disparity data. Please see the [Google AI Blog](https://ai.googleblog.com/2019/08/turbo-improved-rainbow-colormap-for.html) for further details.

<div class="plot">

gradient = np.linspace(0, 1, 256) gradient = np.vstack((gradient, gradient)) cmaps = \['turbo', 'jet', 'gist\_rainbow\_r', 'hsv\_r'\]

fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(cmaps), constrained\_layout=True) for name, ax in zip(cmaps, axs): ax.imshow(gradient, aspect='auto', cmap=plt.get\_cmap(name)) ax.set\_title(name) ax.set\_axis\_off()

</div>

### `colors.BoundaryNorm` supports *extend* keyword argument

<span class="title-ref">\~.colors.BoundaryNorm</span> now has an *extend* keyword argument, analogous to *extend* in <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contourf</span>. When set to 'both', 'min', or 'max', it maps the corresponding out-of-range values to <span class="title-ref">\~.colors.Colormap</span> lookup-table indices near the appropriate ends of their range so that the colors for out-of range values are adjacent to, but distinct from, their in-range neighbors. The colorbar inherits the *extend* argument from the norm, so with `extend='both'`, for example, the colorbar will have triangular extensions for out-of-range values with colors that differ from adjacent in-range colors.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.colors import BoundaryNorm import numpy as np

\# Make the data dx, dy = 0.05, 0.05 y, x = np.mgrid\[slice(1, 5 + dy, dy), slice(1, 5 + dx, dx)\] z = np.sin(x) \*\* 10 + np.cos(10 + y \* x) \* np.cos(x) z = z\[:-1, :-1\]

\# Z roughly varies between -1 and +1. \# Color boundary levels range from -0.8 to 0.8, so there are out-of-bounds \# areas. levels = \[-0.8, -0.5, -0.2, 0.2, 0.5, 0.8\] cmap = plt.get\_cmap('PiYG')

fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, constrained\_layout=True, sharex=True)

\# Before this change: norm = BoundaryNorm(levels, ncolors=cmap.N) im = axs\[0\].pcolormesh(x, y, z, cmap=cmap, norm=norm) fig.colorbar(im, ax=axs\[0\], extend='both') axs\[0\].axis(\[x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()\]) axs\[0\].set\_title("Colorbar with extend='both'")

\# With the new keyword: norm = BoundaryNorm(levels, ncolors=cmap.N, extend='both') im = axs\[1\].pcolormesh(x, y, z, cmap=cmap, norm=norm) fig.colorbar(im, ax=axs\[1\]) \# note that the colorbar is updated accordingly axs\[1\].axis(\[x.min(), x.max(), y.min(), y.max()\]) axs\[1\].set\_title("BoundaryNorm with extend='both'")

plt.show()

</div>

### Text color for legend labels

The text color of legend labels can now be set by passing a parameter `labelcolor` to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.legend</span>. The `labelcolor` keyword can be:

  - A single color (either a string or RGBA tuple), which adjusts the text color of all the labels.
  - A list or tuple, allowing the text color of each label to be set individually.
  - `linecolor`, which sets the text color of each label to match the corresponding line color.
  - `markerfacecolor`, which sets the text color of each label to match the corresponding marker face color.
  - `markeredgecolor`, which sets the text color of each label to match the corresponding marker edge color.

<div class="plot">

options = \['C3', 'linecolor', 'markerfacecolor', 'markeredgecolor'\]

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, constrained\_layout=True) for ax, color in zip(axs.flat, options): ax.plot(\[1, 2, 3\], marker='o', color='C0', markerfacecolor='C1', markeredgecolor='C2', linewidth=3, markersize=10, markeredgewidth=3, label='a line')

> ax.legend(labelcolor=color) ax.set\_title(f'labelcolor={color\!r}')
> 
> ax.margins(0.1)

</div>

### Pcolor and Pcolormesh now accept `shading='nearest'` and `'auto'`

Previously <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.pcolor</span> and <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.pcolormesh</span> handled the situation where *x* and *y* have the same (respective) size as *C* by dropping the last row and column of *C*, and *x* and *y* are regarded as the edges of the remaining rows and columns in *C*. However, many users want *x* and *y* centered on the rows and columns of *C*.

To accommodate this, `shading='nearest'` and `shading='auto'` are new allowed strings for the *shading* keyword argument. `'nearest'` will center the color on *x* and *y* if *x* and *y* have the same dimensions as *C* (otherwise an error will be thrown). `shading='auto'` will choose 'flat' or 'nearest' based on the size of *X*, *Y*, *C*.

If `shading='flat'` then *X*, and *Y* should have dimensions one larger than *C*. If *X* and *Y* have the same dimensions as *C*, then the previous behavior is used and the last row and column of *C* are dropped, and a DeprecationWarning is emitted.

Users can also specify this by the new `pcolor.shading` in their `.matplotlibrc` or via <span class="title-ref">.rcParams</span>.

See \[pcolormesh \</gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/pcolormesh\_grids\>\](pcolormesh \</gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/pcolormesh\_grids\>.md) for examples.

## Titles, ticks, and labels

### Align labels to Axes edges

<span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.set\_xlabel</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.set\_ylabel</span> and `ColorbarBase.set_label` support a parameter `loc` for simplified positioning. For the xlabel, the supported values are 'left', 'center', or 'right'. For the ylabel, the supported values are 'bottom', 'center', or 'top'.

The default is controlled via `xaxis.labellocation` and `yaxis.labellocation`; the Colorbar label takes the rcParam based on its orientation.

<div class="plot">

options = \['left', 'center', 'right'\] fig, axs = plt.subplots(len(options), 1, constrained\_layout=True) for ax, loc in zip(axs, options): ax.plot(\[1, 2, 3\]) ax.set\_xlabel(f'xlabel loc={loc\!r}', loc=loc)

options = \['bottom', 'center', 'top'\] fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, len(options), constrained\_layout=True) for ax, loc in zip(axs, options): ax.plot(\[1, 2, 3\]) ax.set\_ylabel(f'ylabel loc={loc\!r}', loc=loc)

</div>

### Allow tick formatters to be set with str or function inputs

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.set\_major\_formatter</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.set\_minor\_formatter</span> now accept <span class="title-ref">str</span> or function inputs in addition to <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.Formatter</span> instances. For a <span class="title-ref">str</span> a <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.StrMethodFormatter</span> is automatically generated and used. For a function a <span class="title-ref">\~.ticker.FuncFormatter</span> is automatically generated and used. In other words, :

    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter('{x} km')
    ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(lambda x, pos: str(x-5))

are shortcuts for:

    import matplotlib.ticker as mticker
    
    ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(mticker.StrMethodFormatter('{x} km'))
    ax.xaxis.set_minor_formatter(
        mticker.FuncFormatter(lambda x, pos: str(x-5))

<div class="plot">

from matplotlib import ticker

titles = \["'{x} km'", "lambda x, pos: str(x-5)"\] formatters = \['{x} km', lambda x, pos: str(x-5)\]

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(8, 2), constrained\_layout=True)

  - for ax, title, formatter in zip(axs, titles, formatters):  
    \# only show the bottom spine ax.yaxis.set\_major\_locator(ticker.NullLocator()) for spine in \['top', 'left', 'right'\]: ax.spines\[spine\].set\_visible(False)
    
    \# define tick positions ax.xaxis.set\_major\_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(1.00)) ax.xaxis.set\_minor\_locator(ticker.MultipleLocator(0.25))
    
    ax.tick\_params(which='major', width=1.00, length=5) ax.tick\_params(which='minor', width=0.75, length=2.5, labelsize=10) ax.set\_xlim(0, 5) ax.set\_ylim(0, 1) ax.text(0.0, 0.2, f'ax.xaxis.set\_major\_formatter({title})', transform=ax.transAxes, fontsize=14, fontname='Monospace', color='tab:blue')
    
    ax.xaxis.set\_major\_formatter(formatter)

</div>

### `Axes.set_title` gains a *y* keyword argument to control auto positioning

<span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.set\_title</span> tries to auto-position the title to avoid any decorators on the top x-axis. This is not always desirable so now *y* is an explicit keyword argument of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.set\_title</span>. It defaults to *None* which means to use auto-positioning. If a value is supplied (i.e. the pre-3.0 default was `y=1.0`) then auto-positioning is turned off. This can also be set with the new rcParameter `axes.titley`.

<div class="plot">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, constrained\_layout=True, figsize=(5, 2)) axs\[0\].set\_title('y=0.7n$\\[sum](){j\_n} x\_j$', y=0.7) axs\[1\].set\_title('y=Nonen$\\[sum](){j\_n} x\_j$') plt.show()

</div>

### Offset text is now set to the top when using `axis.tick_top()`

Solves the issue that the power indicator (e.g., 1e4) stayed on the bottom, even if the ticks were on the top.

### Set zorder of contour labels

<span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.clabel</span> now accepts a *zorder* keyword argument making it easier to set the *zorder* of contour labels. If not specified, the default *zorder* of clabels used to always be 3 (i.e. the default *zorder* of <span class="title-ref">\~.text.Text</span>) irrespective of the *zorder* passed to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contour</span>/<span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contourf</span>. The new default *zorder* for clabels has been changed to (`2 + zorder` passed to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contour</span> / <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contourf</span>).

## Other changes

### New `Axes.axline` method

A new <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.axline</span> method has been added to draw infinitely long lines that pass through two points.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="True">

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.axline((.1, .1), slope=5, color='C0', label='by slope') ax.axline((.1, .2), (.8, .7), color='C3', label='by points')

ax.legend()

</div>

### `imshow` now coerces 3D arrays with depth 1 to 2D

Starting from this version arrays of size MxNx1 will be coerced into MxN for displaying. This means commands like `plt.imshow(np.random.rand(3, 3, 1))` will no longer return an error message that the image shape is invalid.

### Better control of `Axes.pie` normalization

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span> would normalize its input *x* if `sum(x) > 1`, but would do nothing if the sum were less than 1. This can be confusing, so an explicit keyword argument *normalize* has been added. By default, the old behavior is preserved.

By passing *normalize*, one can explicitly control whether any rescaling takes place or whether partial pies should be created. If normalization is disabled, and `sum(x) > 1`, then an error is raised.

<div class="plot">

  - def label(x):  
    return \[str(v) for v in x\]

x = np.array(\[0.25, 0.3, 0.3\]) fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 2, constrained\_layout=True)

ax\[0, 0\].pie(x, autopct='%1.1f%%', labels=label(x), normalize=False) ax\[0, 0\].set\_title('normalize=False') ax\[0, 1\].pie(x, autopct='%1.2f%%', labels=label(x), normalize=True) ax\[0, 1\].set\_title('normalize=True')

\# This is supposed to show the 'old' behavior of not passing *normalize* \# explicitly, but for the purposes of keeping the documentation build \# warning-free, and future proof for when the deprecation is made \# permanent, we pass *normalize* here explicitly anyway. ax\[1, 0\].pie(x, autopct='%1.2f%%', labels=label(x), normalize=False) ax\[1, 0\].set\_title('normalize unspecifiednsum(x) \< 1') ax\[1, 1\].pie(x \* 10, autopct='%1.2f%%', labels=label(x \* 10), normalize=True) ax\[1, 1\].set\_title('normalize unspecifiednsum(x) \> 1')

</div>

### Dates use a modern epoch

Matplotlib converts dates to days since an epoch using <span class="title-ref">.dates.date2num</span> (via <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.units</span>). Previously, an epoch of `0000-12-31T00:00:00` was used so that `0001-01-01` was converted to 1.0. An epoch so distant in the past meant that a modern date was not able to preserve microseconds because 2000 years times the 2^(-52) resolution of a 64-bit float gives 14 microseconds.

Here we change the default epoch to the more reasonable UNIX default of `1970-01-01T00:00:00` which for a modern date has 0.35 microsecond resolution. (Finer resolution is not possible because we rely on <span class="title-ref">datetime.datetime</span> for the date locators). Access to the epoch is provided by <span class="title-ref">\~.dates.get\_epoch</span>, and there is a new `date.epoch` rcParam. The user may also call <span class="title-ref">\~.dates.set\_epoch</span>, but it must be set *before* any date conversion or plotting is used.

If you have data stored as ordinal floats in the old epoch, you can convert them to the new ordinal using the following formula:

    new_ordinal = old_ordinal + mdates.date2num(np.datetime64('0000-12-31'))

### Lines now accept `MarkerStyle` instances as input

Similar to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.lines.Line2D</span> now accept <span class="title-ref">\~.markers.MarkerStyle</span> instances as input for the *marker* parameter:

    plt.plot(..., marker=matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle("D"))

## Fonts

### Simple syntax to select fonts by absolute path

Fonts can now be selected by passing an absolute <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path</span> to the *font* keyword argument of <span class="title-ref">.Text</span>.

### Improved font weight detection

Matplotlib is now better able to determine the weight of fonts from their metadata, allowing to differentiate between fonts within the same family more accurately.

## rcParams improvements

### `matplotlib.rc_context` can be used as a decorator

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.rc\_context</span> can now be used as a decorator (technically, it is now implemented as a <span class="title-ref">contextlib.contextmanager</span>), e.g., :

    @rc_context({"lines.linewidth": 2})
    def some_function(...):
        ...

### rcParams for controlling default "raise window" behavior

The new config option `figure.raise_window` allows disabling of the raising of the plot window when calling <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.show</span> or <span class="title-ref">\~.pyplot.pause</span>. The `MacOSX` backend is currently not supported.

### Add generalized `mathtext.fallback` to rcParams

New `mathtext.fallback` rcParam. Takes "cm", "stix", "stixsans" or "none" to turn fallback off. The rcParam *mathtext.fallback\_to\_cm* is deprecated, but if used, will override new fallback.

### Add `contour.linewidth` to rcParams

The new config option `contour.linewidth` allows to control the default line width of contours as a float. When set to `None`, the line widths fall back to `lines.linewidth`. The config value is overridden as usual by the *linewidths* argument passed to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contour</span> when it is not set to `None`.

## 3D Axes improvements

### `Axes3D` no longer distorts the 3D plot to match the 2D aspect ratio

Plots made with <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D</span> were previously stretched to fit a square bounding box. As this stretching was done after the projection from 3D to 2D, it resulted in distorted images if non-square bounding boxes were used. As of 3.3, this no longer occurs.

Currently, modes of setting the aspect (via <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.set\_aspect</span>) in data space are not supported for Axes3D but may be in the future. If you want to simulate having equal aspect in data space, set the ratio of your data limits to match the value of <span class="title-ref">\~.get\_box\_aspect</span>. To control these ratios use the <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.set\_box\_aspect</span> method which accepts the ratios as a 3-tuple of X:Y:Z. The default aspect ratio is 4:4:3.

### 3D axes now support minor ticks

<div class="plot" data-include-source="True">

ax = plt.figure().add\_subplot(projection='3d')

ax.scatter(\[0, 1, 2\], \[1, 3, 5\], \[30, 50, 70\])

ax.set\_xticks(\[0.25, 0.75, 1.25, 1.75\], minor=True) ax.set\_xticklabels(\['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'\], minor=True)

ax.set\_yticks(\[1.5, 2.5, 3.5, 4.5\], minor=True) ax.set\_yticklabels(\['A', 'B', 'C', 'D'\], minor=True)

ax.set\_zticks(\[35, 45, 55, 65\], minor=True) ax.set\_zticklabels(\[r'$alpha$', r'$beta$', r'$delta$', r'$gamma$'\], minor=True)

ax.tick\_params(which='major', color='C0', labelcolor='C0', width=5) ax.tick\_params(which='minor', color='C1', labelcolor='C1', width=3)

</div>

### Home/Forward/Backward buttons now work with 3D axes

## Interactive tool improvements

### More consistent toolbar behavior across backends

Toolbar features are now more consistent across backends. The history buttons will auto-disable when there is no further action in a direction. The pan and zoom buttons will be marked active when they are in use.

In NbAgg and WebAgg, the toolbar buttons are now grouped similarly to other backends. The WebAgg toolbar now uses the same icons as other backends.

### Toolbar icons are now styled for dark themes

On dark themes, toolbar icons will now be inverted. When using the GTK3Agg backend, toolbar icons are now symbolic, and both foreground and background colors will follow the theme. Tooltips should also behave correctly.

### Cursor text now uses a number of significant digits matching pointing precision

Previously, the x/y position displayed by the cursor text would usually include far more significant digits than the mouse pointing precision (typically one pixel). This is now fixed for linear scales.

### GTK / Qt zoom rectangle now black and white

This makes it visible even over a dark background.

### Event handler simplifications

The <span class="title-ref">.backend\_bases.key\_press\_handler</span> and <span class="title-ref">.backend\_bases.button\_press\_handler</span> event handlers can now be directly connected to a canvas with `canvas.mpl_connect("key_press_event", key_press_handler)` and `canvas.mpl_connect("button_press_event", button_press_handler)`, rather than having to write wrapper functions that fill in the (now optional) *canvas* and *toolbar* parameters.

## Functions to compute a Path's size

Various functions were added to <span class="title-ref">\~.bezier.BezierSegment</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.path.Path</span> to allow computation of the shape/size of a <span class="title-ref">\~.path.Path</span> and its composite Bezier curves.

In addition to the fixes below, <span class="title-ref">\~.bezier.BezierSegment</span> has gained more documentation and usability improvements, including properties that contain its dimension, degree, control\_points, and more.

### Better interface for Path segment iteration

<span class="title-ref">\~.path.Path.iter\_bezier</span> iterates through the <span class="title-ref">\~.bezier.BezierSegment</span>'s that make up the Path. This is much more useful typically than the existing <span class="title-ref">\~.path.Path.iter\_segments</span> function, which returns the absolute minimum amount of information possible to reconstruct the Path.

### Fixed bug that computed a Path's Bbox incorrectly

Historically, <span class="title-ref">\~.path.Path.get\_extents</span> has always simply returned the Bbox of a curve's control points, instead of the Bbox of the curve itself. While this is a correct upper bound for the path's extents, it can differ dramatically from the Path's actual extents for non-linear Bezier curves.

## Backend-specific improvements

### `savefig()` gained a *backend* keyword argument

The *backend* keyword argument to `savefig` can now be used to pick the rendering backend without having to globally set the backend; e.g., one can save PDFs using the pgf backend with `savefig("file.pdf", backend="pgf")`.

### The SVG backend can now render hatches with transparency

The SVG backend now respects the hatch stroke alpha. Useful applications are, among others, semi-transparent hatches as a subtle way to differentiate columns in bar plots.

### SVG supports URLs on more artists

URLs on more artists (i.e., from <span class="title-ref">.Artist.set\_url</span>) will now be saved in SVG files, namely, `Tick`s and `Line2D`s are now supported.

### Images in SVG will no longer be blurred in some viewers

A style is now supplied to images without interpolation (`imshow(..., interpolation='none'`) so that SVG image viewers will no longer perform interpolation when rendering themselves.

### Saving SVG now supports adding metadata

When saving SVG files, metadata can now be passed which will be saved in the file using [Dublin Core](https://www.dublincore.org/specifications/dublin-core/) and [RDF](https://www.w3.org/1999/.status/PR-rdf-syntax-19990105/status). A list of valid metadata can be found in the documentation for <span class="title-ref">.FigureCanvasSVG.print\_svg</span>.

### Saving PDF metadata via PGF now consistent with PDF backend

When saving PDF files using the PGF backend, passed metadata will be interpreted in the same way as with the PDF backend. Previously, this metadata was only accepted by the PGF backend when saving a multi-page PDF with <span class="title-ref">.backend\_pgf.PdfPages</span>, but is now allowed when saving a single figure, as well.

### NbAgg and WebAgg no longer use jQuery & jQuery UI

Instead, they are implemented using vanilla JavaScript. Please report any issues with browsers.

## Figure and Axes creation / management

### New subfigure functionality

New <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_subfigure</span> and <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.subfigures</span> functionalities allow creating virtual figures within figures. Similar nesting was previously done with nested gridspecs (see \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/gridspec\_nested\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/gridspec\_nested.md)). However, this did not allow localized figure artists (e.g., a colorbar or suptitle) that only pertained to each subgridspec.

The new methods <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_subfigure</span> and <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.subfigures</span> are meant to rhyme with <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_subplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.subplots</span> and have most of the same arguments.

See \[/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/subfigures\](/gallery/subplots\_axes\_and\_figures/subfigures.md) for further details.

\> **Note** \> The subfigure functionality is experimental API as of v3.4.

<div class="plot">

  - def example\_plot(ax, fontsize=12, hide\_labels=False):  
    pc = ax.pcolormesh(np.random.randn(30, 30)) if not hide\_labels: ax.set\_xlabel('x-label', fontsize=fontsize) ax.set\_ylabel('y-label', fontsize=fontsize) ax.set\_title('Title', fontsize=fontsize) return pc

np.random.seed(19680808) fig = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True, figsize=(10, 4)) subfigs = fig.subfigures(1, 2, wspace=0.07)

axsLeft = subfigs\[0\].subplots(1, 2, sharey=True) subfigs\[0\].set\_facecolor('\#eee') for ax in axsLeft: pc = example\_plot(ax) subfigs\[0\].suptitle('Left plots', fontsize='x-large') subfigs\[0\].colorbar(pc, shrink=0.6, ax=axsLeft, location='bottom')

axsRight = subfigs\[1\].subplots(3, 1, sharex=True) for nn, ax in enumerate(axsRight): pc = example\_plot(ax, hide\_labels=True) if nn == 2: ax.set\_xlabel('xlabel') if nn == 1: ax.set\_ylabel('ylabel') subfigs\[1\].colorbar(pc, shrink=0.6, ax=axsRight) subfigs\[1\].suptitle('Right plots', fontsize='x-large')

fig.suptitle('Figure suptitle', fontsize='xx-large')

plt.show()

</div>

### Single-line string notation for `subplot_mosaic`

<span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> now accept a single-line string, using semicolons to delimit rows. Namely, :

    plt.subplot_mosaic(
        """
        AB
        CC
        """)

may be written as the shorter:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

plt.subplot\_mosaic("AB;CC")

</div>

### Changes to behavior of Axes creation methods (`gca`, `add_axes`, `add_subplot`)

The behavior of the functions to create new Axes (<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.axes</span>, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span>, <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_axes</span>, <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_subplot</span>) has changed. In the past, these functions would detect if you were attempting to create Axes with the same keyword arguments as already-existing Axes in the current Figure, and if so, they would return the existing Axes. Now, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.axes</span>, <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_axes</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.add\_subplot</span> will always create new Axes. <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> will continue to reuse an existing Axes with a matching subplot spec and equal *kwargs*.

Correspondingly, the behavior of the functions to get the current Axes (<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.gca</span>, <span class="title-ref">.figure.Figure.gca</span>) has changed. In the past, these functions accepted keyword arguments. If the keyword arguments matched an already-existing Axes, then that Axes would be returned, otherwise new Axes would be created with those keyword arguments. Now, the keyword arguments are only considered if there are no Axes at all in the current figure. In a future release, these functions will not accept keyword arguments at all.

### `add_subplot`/`add_axes` gained an *axes\_class* parameter

In particular, `mpl_toolkits` Axes subclasses can now be idiomatically used using, e.g., `fig.add_subplot(axes_class=mpl_toolkits.axislines.Axes)`

### Subplot and subplot2grid can now work with constrained layout

`constrained_layout` depends on a single <span class="title-ref">.GridSpec</span> for each logical layout on a figure. Previously, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot2grid</span> added a new `GridSpec` each time they were called and were therefore incompatible with `constrained_layout`.

Now `subplot` attempts to reuse the `GridSpec` if the number of rows and columns is the same as the top level GridSpec already in the figure, i.e., `plt.subplot(2, 1, 2)` will use the same GridSpec as `plt.subplot(2, 1, 1)` and the `constrained_layout=True` option to <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure</span> will work.

In contrast, mixing *nrows* and *ncols* will *not* work with `constrained_layout`: `plt.subplot(2, 2, 1)` followed by `plt.subplots(2, 1, 2)` will still produce two GridSpecs, and `constrained_layout=True` will give bad results. In order to get the desired effect, the second call can specify the cells the second Axes is meant to cover: `plt.subplots(2, 2, (2, 4))`, or the more Pythonic `plt.subplot2grid((2, 2), (0, 1), rowspan=2)` can be used.

## Plotting methods

### `axline` supports *transform* parameter

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axline</span> now supports the *transform* parameter, which applies to the points *xy1*, *xy2*. The *slope* (if given) is always in data coordinates.

For example, this can be used with `ax.transAxes` for drawing lines with a fixed slope. In the following plot, the line appears through the same point on both Axes, even though they show different data limits.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

  - for i, ax in enumerate(axs):  
    ax.axline((0.25, 0), slope=2, transform=ax.transAxes) ax.set(xlim=(i, i+5), ylim=(i, i+5))

</div>

### New automatic labeling for bar charts

A new <span class="title-ref">.Axes.bar\_label</span> method has been added for auto-labeling bar charts.

![Example of the new automatic labeling.](/gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/images/sphx_glr_bar_label_demo_001.png)

### A list of hatches can be specified to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.barh</span>

Similar to some other rectangle properties, it is now possible to hand a list of hatch styles to <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.barh</span> in order to create bars with different hatch styles, e.g.

<div class="plot">

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.bar(\[1, 2\], \[2, 3\], hatch=\['+', 'o'\]) plt.show()

</div>

### Setting `BarContainer` orientation

<span class="title-ref">.BarContainer</span> now accepts a new string argument *orientation*. It can be either `'vertical'` or `'horizontal'`, default is `None`.

### Contour plots now default to using ScalarFormatter

Pass `fmt="%1.3f"` to the contouring call to restore the old default label format.

### `Axes.errorbar` cycles non-color properties correctly

Formerly, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span> incorrectly skipped the Axes property cycle if a color was explicitly specified, even if the property cycler was for other properties (such as line style). Now, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span> will advance the Axes property cycle as done for <span class="title-ref">.Axes.plot</span>, i.e., as long as all properties in the cycler are not explicitly passed.

For example, the following will cycle through the line styles:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

x = np.arange(0.1, 4, 0.5) y = np.exp(-x) offsets = \[0, 1\]

plt.rcParams\['axes.prop\_cycle'\] = plt.cycler('linestyle', \['-', '--'\])

fig, ax = plt.subplots() for offset in offsets: ax.errorbar(x, y + offset, xerr=0.1, yerr=0.3, fmt='tab:blue')

</div>

### `errorbar` *errorevery* parameter matches *markevery*

Similar to the *markevery* parameter to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span>, the *errorevery* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.errorbar</span> now accept slices and NumPy fancy indexes (which must match the size of *x*).

<div class="plot">

x = np.linspace(0, 1, 15) y = x \* (1-x) yerr = y/6

fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, constrained\_layout=True) ax\[0\].errorbar(x, y, yerr, capsize=2) ax\[0\].set\_title('errorevery unspecified')

  - ax\[1\].errorbar(x, y, yerr, capsize=2,  
    errorevery=\[False, True, True, False, True\] \* 3)

ax\[1\].set\_title('errorevery=\[False, True, True, False, True\] \* 3')

</div>

### `hexbin` supports data reference for *C* parameter

As with the *x* and *y* parameters, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.hexbin</span> now supports passing the *C* parameter using a data reference.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

  - data = {  
    'a': np.random.rand(1000), 'b': np.random.rand(1000), 'c': np.random.rand(1000),

}

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.hexbin('a', 'b', C='c', data=data, gridsize=10)

</div>

### Support callable for formatting of Sankey labels

The <span class="title-ref">format</span> parameter of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sankey.Sankey</span> can now accept callables.

This allows the use of an arbitrary function to label flows, for example allowing the mapping of numbers to emoji.

<div class="plot">

from matplotlib.sankey import Sankey import math

  - def display\_in\_cats(values, min\_cats, max\_cats):
    
      - def display\_in\_cat\_scale(value):  
        max\_value = max(values, key=abs) number\_cats\_to\_show = max(min\_cats, math.floor(abs(value) / max\_value \* max\_cats)) return str(number\_cats\_to\_show \* '🐱')
    
    return display\_in\_cat\_scale

flows = \[35, 15, 40, -20, -15, -5, -40, -10\] orientations = \[-1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, -1, -1\]

\# Cats are good, we want a strictly positive number of them min\_cats = 1 \# More than four cats might be too much for some people max\_cats = 4

cats\_format = display\_in\_cats(flows, min\_cats, max\_cats)

  - sankey = Sankey(flows=flows, orientations=orientations, format=cats\_format,  
    offset=.1, head\_angle=180, shoulder=0, scale=.010)

diagrams = sankey.finish()

diagrams\[0\].texts\[2\].set\_text('')

  - plt.title(f'Sankey flows measured in cats n'  
    f'🐱 = {max(flows, key=abs) / max\_cats}')

plt.show()

</div>

### `Axes.spines` access shortcuts

`Axes.spines` is now a dedicated container class <span class="title-ref">.Spines</span> for a set of <span class="title-ref">.Spine</span>s instead of an `OrderedDict`. On top of dict-like access, `Axes.spines` now also supports some `pandas.Series`-like features.

Accessing single elements by item or by attribute:

    ax.spines['top'].set_visible(False)
    ax.spines.top.set_visible(False)

Accessing a subset of items:

    ax.spines[['top', 'right']].set_visible(False)

Accessing all items simultaneously:

    ax.spines[:].set_visible(False)

### New `stairs` method and `StepPatch` artist

<span class="title-ref">.pyplot.stairs</span> and the underlying artist <span class="title-ref">\~.matplotlib.patches.StepPatch</span> provide a cleaner interface for plotting stepwise constant functions for the common case that you know the step edges. This supersedes many use cases of <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.step</span>, for instance when plotting the output of <span class="title-ref">numpy.histogram</span>.

For both the artist and the function, the x-like edges input is one element longer than the y-like values input

<div class="plot">

np.random.seed(0) h, edges = np.histogram(np.random.normal(5, 2, 5000), bins=np.linspace(0,10,20))

fig, ax = plt.subplots(constrained\_layout=True)

ax.stairs(h, edges)

plt.show()

</div>

See \[/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/stairs\_demo\](/gallery/lines\_bars\_and\_markers/stairs\_demo.md) for examples.

### Added *orientation* parameter for stem plots

By default, stem lines are vertical. They can be changed to horizontal using the *orientation* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.Axes.stem</span> or \`.pyplot.stem\`:

<div class="plot">

locs = np.linspace(0.1, 2 \* np.pi, 25) heads = np.cos(locs)

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.stem(locs, heads, orientation='horizontal')

</div>

### Angles on Bracket arrow styles

Angles specified on the *Bracket* arrow styles (`]-[`, `]-`, `-[`, or `|-|` passed to *arrowstyle* parameter of <span class="title-ref">.FancyArrowPatch</span>) are now applied. Previously, the *angleA* and *angleB* options were allowed, but did nothing.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.set(xlim=(0, 1), ylim=(-1, 4))

  - for i, stylename in enumerate(('\]-\[', '')):
    
      - for j, angle in enumerate(\[-30, 60\]):  
        arrowstyle = f'{stylename},angleA={angle},angleB={-angle}' patch = mpatches.FancyArrowPatch((0.1, 2\*i + j), (0.9, 2\*i + j), arrowstyle=arrowstyle, mutation\_scale=25) ax.text(0.5, 2\*i + j, arrowstyle, verticalalignment='bottom', horizontalalignment='center') ax.add\_patch(patch)

</div>

### `TickedStroke` patheffect

The new <span class="title-ref">.TickedStroke</span> patheffect can be used to produce lines with a ticked style. This can be used to, e.g., distinguish the valid and invalid sides of the constraint boundaries in the solution space of optimizations.

![](/gallery/misc/images/sphx_glr_tickedstroke_demo_002.png)

## Colors and colormaps

### Collection color specification and mapping

Reworking the handling of color mapping and the keyword arguments for *facecolor* and *edgecolor* has resulted in three behavior changes:

1.  Color mapping can be turned off by calling `Collection.set_array(None)`. Previously, this would have no effect.
2.  When a mappable array is set, with `facecolor='none'` and `edgecolor='face'`, both the faces and the edges are left uncolored. Previously the edges would be color-mapped.
3.  When a mappable array is set, with `facecolor='none'` and `edgecolor='red'`, the edges are red. This addresses Issue \#1302. Previously the edges would be color-mapped.

### Transparency (alpha) can be set as an array in collections

Previously, the alpha value controlling transparency in collections could be specified only as a scalar applied to all elements in the collection. For example, all the markers in a <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.scatter</span> plot, or all the quadrilaterals in a <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> plot, would have the same alpha value.

Now it is possible to supply alpha as an array with one value for each element (marker, quadrilateral, etc.) in a collection.

<div class="plot">

x = np.arange(5, dtype=float) y = np.arange(5, dtype=float) \# z and zalpha for demo pcolormesh z = x\[1:, np.newaxis\] + y\[np.newaxis, 1:\] zalpha = np.ones\_like(z) zalpha\[::2, ::2\] = 0.3 \# alternate patches are partly transparent \# s and salpha for demo scatter s = x salpha = np.linspace(0.1, 0.9, len(x)) \# just a ramp

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, constrained\_layout=True) axs\[0, 0\].pcolormesh(x, y, z, alpha=zalpha) axs\[0, 0\].set\_title("pcolormesh") axs\[0, 1\].scatter(x, y, c=s, alpha=salpha) axs\[0, 1\].set\_title("color-mapped") axs\[1, 0\].scatter(x, y, c='k', alpha=salpha) axs\[1, 0\].set\_title("c='k'") axs\[1, 1\].scatter(x, y, c=\['r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm'\], alpha=salpha) axs\[1, 1\].set\_title("c=\['r', 'g', 'b', 'c', 'm'\]")

</div>

### pcolormesh has improved transparency handling by enabling snapping

Due to how the snapping keyword argument was getting passed to the Agg backend, previous versions of Matplotlib would appear to show lines between the grid edges of a mesh with transparency. This version now applies snapping by default. To restore the old behavior (e.g., for test images), you may set `pcolormesh.snap` to <span class="title-ref">False</span>.

<div class="plot">

\# Use old pcolormesh snapping values plt.rcParams\['pcolormesh.snap'\] = False fig, ax = plt.subplots() xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10)) z = (xx + 1) \* (yy + 1) mesh = ax.pcolormesh(xx, yy, z, shading='auto', alpha=0.5) fig.colorbar(mesh, orientation='vertical') ax.set\_title('Before (pcolormesh.snap = False)')

</div>

Note that there are lines between the grid boundaries of the main plot which are not the same transparency. The colorbar also shows these lines when a transparency is added to the colormap because internally it uses pcolormesh to draw the colorbar. With snapping on by default (below), the lines at the grid boundaries disappear.

<div class="plot">

fig, ax = plt.subplots() xx, yy = np.meshgrid(np.arange(10), np.arange(10)) z = (xx + 1) \* (yy + 1) mesh = ax.pcolormesh(xx, yy, z, shading='auto', alpha=0.5) fig.colorbar(mesh, orientation='vertical') ax.set\_title('After (default: pcolormesh.snap = True)')

### IPython representations for Colormap objects

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colors.Colormap</span> object now has image representations for IPython / Jupyter backends. Cells returning a colormap on the last line will display an image of the colormap.

`Colormap.set_extremes` and `Colormap.with_extremes` `` ` --------------------------------------------------------  Because the `.Colormap.set_bad`, `.Colormap.set_under` and `.Colormap.set_over` methods modify the colormap in place, the user must be careful to first make a copy of the colormap if setting the extreme colors e.g. for a builtin colormap.  The new ``Colormap.with\_extremes(bad=..., under=..., over=...)``can be used to first copy the colormap and set the extreme colors on that copy.  The new `.Colormap.set_extremes` method is provided for API symmetry with `.Colormap.with_extremes`, but note that it suffers from the same issue as the earlier individual setters.  Get under/over/bad colors of Colormap objects ---------------------------------------------  `matplotlib.colors.Colormap` now has methods `~.colors.Colormap.get_under`, `~.colors.Colormap.get_over`, `~.colors.Colormap.get_bad` for the colors used for out-of-range and masked values.  New``cm.unregister\_cmap`function -----------------------------------`matplotlib.cm.unregister\_cmap`allows users to remove a colormap that they have previously registered.  New`CenteredNorm``for symmetrical data around a center ---------------------------------------------------------  In cases where data is symmetrical around a center, for example, positive and negative anomalies around a center zero, `~.matplotlib.colors.CenteredNorm` is a new norm that automatically creates a symmetrical mapping around the center. This norm is well suited to be combined with a divergent colormap which uses an unsaturated color in its center.  .. plot::      from matplotlib.colors import CenteredNorm      np.random.seed(20201004)     data = np.random.normal(size=(3, 4), loc=1)      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     pc = ax.pcolormesh(data, cmap=plt.get_cmap('RdGy'), norm=CenteredNorm())     fig.colorbar(pc)     ax.set_title('data centered around zero')      # add text annotation     for irow, data_row in enumerate(data):         for icol, val in enumerate(data_row):             ax.text(icol + 0.5, irow + 0.5, f'{val:.2f}', color='C0',                     size=16, va='center', ha='center')     plt.show()  If the center of symmetry is different from 0, it can be set with the *vcenter* argument. To manually set the range of `~.matplotlib.colors.CenteredNorm`, use the *halfrange* argument.  See [colormapnorms](#colormapnorms) for an example and more details about data normalization.  New``FuncNorm``for arbitrary normalizations ---------------------------------------------  The `.FuncNorm` allows for arbitrary normalization using functions for the forward and inverse.  .. plot::      from matplotlib.colors import FuncNorm      def forward(x):         return x**2     def inverse(x):         return np.sqrt(x)      norm = FuncNorm((forward, inverse), vmin=0, vmax=3)      np.random.seed(20201004)     data = np.random.normal(size=(3, 4), loc=1)      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     pc = ax.pcolormesh(data, norm=norm)     fig.colorbar(pc)     ax.set_title('squared normalization')      # add text annotation     for irow, data_row in enumerate(data):         for icol, val in enumerate(data_row):             ax.text(icol + 0.5, irow + 0.5, f'{val:.2f}', color='C0',                     size=16, va='center', ha='center')     plt.show()  See [colormapnorms](#colormapnorms) for an example and more details about data normalization.  GridSpec-based colorbars can now be positioned above or to the left of the main axes ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  ... by passing``location="top"`or`location="left"`to the`colorbar()``call.   Titles, ticks, and labels =========================  supxlabel and supylabel -----------------------  It is possible to add x- and y-labels to a whole figure, analogous to `.Figure.suptitle` using the new `.Figure.supxlabel` and `.Figure.supylabel` methods.  .. plot::      np.random.seed(19680801)     fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 2, figsize=(5, 5), constrained_layout=True,                             sharex=True, sharey=True)      for nn, ax in enumerate(axs.flat):         ax.set_title(f'Channel {nn}')         ax.plot(np.cumsum(np.random.randn(50)))      fig.supxlabel('Time [s]')     fig.supylabel('Data [V]')  Shared-axes``subplots`tick label visibility is now correct for top or left labels ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  When calling`subplots(..., sharex=True, sharey=True)`, Matplotlib automatically hides x tick labels for Axes not in the first column and y tick labels for Axes not in the last row. This behavior is incorrect if rcParams specify that Axes should be labeled on the top (`rcParams\["xtick.labeltop"\] = True`) or on the right (`rcParams\["ytick.labelright"\] = True``).  Cases such as the following are now handled correctly (adjusting visibility as needed on the first row and last column of Axes):  .. plot::     :include-source:      plt.rcParams["xtick.labelbottom"] = False     plt.rcParams["xtick.labeltop"] = True     plt.rcParams["ytick.labelleft"] = False     plt.rcParams["ytick.labelright"] = True      fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True)  An iterable object with labels can be passed to `.Axes.plot` ------------------------------------------------------------  When plotting multiple datasets by passing 2D data as *y* value to `~.Axes.plot`, labels for the datasets can be passed as a list, the length matching the number of columns in *y*.  .. plot::     :include-source:      x = [1, 2, 3]      y = [[1, 2],          [2, 5],          [4, 9]]      plt.plot(x, y, label=['low', 'high'])     plt.legend()   Fonts and Text ==============  Text transform can rotate text direction ----------------------------------------  The new `.Text` parameter``transform\_rotates\_text`now sets whether rotations of the transform affect the text direction.  .. figure:: /gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/images/sphx_glr_text_rotation_relative_to_line_001.png    :target: ../../gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/text_rotation_relative_to_line.html     Example of the new *transform_rotates_text* parameter`matplotlib.mathtext``now supports *overset* and *underset* LaTeX symbols ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  `.mathtext` now supports *overset* and *underset*, called as``overset{annotation}{body}`or`underset{annotation}{body}`, where *annotation* is the text "above" or "below" the *body*.  .. plot::      math_expr = r"$ x \overset{f}{\rightarrow} y \underset{f}{\leftarrow} z $"     plt.text(0.4, 0.5, math_expr, usetex=False)  *math_fontfamily* parameter to change`Text``font family ----------------------------------------------------------  The new *math_fontfamily* parameter may be used to change the family of fonts for each individual text element in a plot. If no parameter is set, the global value :rc:`mathtext.fontset` will be used.  .. figure:: /gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/images/sphx_glr_mathtext_fontfamily_example_001.png    :target: ../../gallery/text_labels_and_annotations/mathtext_fontfamily_example.html``TextArea`/`AnchoredText``support *horizontalalignment* -----------------------------------------------------------  The horizontal alignment of text in a `.TextArea` or `.AnchoredText` may now be specified, which is mostly effective for multiline text:  .. plot::      from matplotlib.offsetbox import AnchoredText      fig, ax = plt.subplots()      text0 = AnchoredText("test\ntest long text", loc="center left",                          pad=0.2, prop={"ha": "left"})     ax.add_artist(text0)      text1 = AnchoredText("test\ntest long text", loc="center",                          pad=0.2, prop={"ha": "center"})     ax.add_artist(text1)      text2 = AnchoredText("test\ntest long text", loc="center right",                          pad=0.2, prop={"ha": "right"})     ax.add_artist(text2)  PDF supports URLs on``Text``artists -------------------------------------  URLs on `.text.Text` artists (i.e., from `.Artist.set_url`) will now be saved in PDF files.   rcParams improvements =====================  New rcParams for dates: set converter and whether to use interval_multiples ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  The new :rc:`date.converter` allows toggling between `matplotlib.dates.DateConverter` and `matplotlib.dates.ConciseDateConverter` using the strings 'auto' and 'concise' respectively.  The new :rc:`date.interval_multiples` allows toggling between the dates locator trying to pick ticks at set intervals (i.e., day 1 and 15 of the month), versus evenly spaced ticks that start wherever the timeseries starts:  .. plot::     :include-source:      dates = np.arange('2001-01-10', '2001-05-23', dtype='datetime64[D]')     y = np.sin(dates.astype(float) / 10)     fig, axs = plt.subplots(nrows=2, constrained_layout=True)      plt.rcParams['date.converter'] = 'concise'     plt.rcParams['date.interval_multiples'] = True     axs[0].plot(dates, y)      plt.rcParams['date.converter'] = 'auto'     plt.rcParams['date.interval_multiples'] = False     axs[1].plot(dates, y)  Date formatters now respect *usetex* rcParam --------------------------------------------  The `.AutoDateFormatter` and `.ConciseDateFormatter` now respect :rc:`text.usetex`, and will thus use fonts consistent with TeX rendering of the default (non-date) formatter. TeX rendering may also be enabled/disabled by passing the *usetex* parameter when creating the formatter instance.  In the following plot, both the x-axis (dates) and y-axis (numbers) now use the same (TeX) font:  .. plot::      from datetime import datetime, timedelta     from matplotlib.dates import ConciseDateFormatter      plt.rc('text', usetex=True)      t0 = datetime(1968, 8, 1)     ts = [t0 + i * timedelta(days=1) for i in range(10)]      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.plot(ts, range(10))     ax.xaxis.set_major_formatter(ConciseDateFormatter(ax.xaxis.get_major_locator()))     ax.set_xlabel('Date')     ax.set_ylabel('Value')  Setting *image.cmap* to a``Colormap``--------------------------------------  It is now possible to set :rc:`image.cmap` to a `.Colormap` instance, such as a colormap created with the new `~.Colormap.set_extremes` above. (This can only be done from Python code, not from the :file:`matplotlibrc` file.)  Tick and tick label colors can be set independently using rcParams ------------------------------------------------------------------  Previously, :rc:`xtick.color` defined both the tick color and the label color. The label color can now be set independently using :rc:`xtick.labelcolor`. It defaults to``'inherit'``which will take the value from :rc:`xtick.color`. The same holds for``ytick.\[label\]color`. For instance, to set the ticks to light grey and the tick labels to black, one can use the following code in a script::      import matplotlib as mpl      mpl.rcParams['xtick.labelcolor'] = 'lightgrey'     mpl.rcParams['xtick.color'] = 'black'     mpl.rcParams['ytick.labelcolor'] = 'lightgrey'     mpl.rcParams['ytick.color'] = 'black'  Or by adding the following lines to the [matplotlibrc <customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files>](#matplotlibrc <customizing-with-matplotlibrc-files>) file, or a Matplotlib style file:`\`none xtick.labelcolor : lightgrey xtick.color : black ytick.labelcolor : lightgrey ytick.color : black

3D Axes improvements `` ` ====================  Errorbar method in 3D Axes --------------------------  The errorbar function `.Axes.errorbar` is ported into the 3D Axes framework in its entirety, supporting features such as custom styling for error lines and cap marks, control over errorbar spacing, upper and lower limit marks.  .. figure:: /gallery/mplot3d/images/sphx_glr_errorbar3d_001.png    :target: ../../gallery/mplot3d/errorbar3d.html  Stem plots in 3D Axes ---------------------  Stem plots are now supported on 3D Axes. Much like 2D stems, `~.axes3d.Axes3D.stem` supports plotting the stems in various orientations:  .. plot::      theta = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi)     x = np.cos(theta - np.pi/2)     y = np.sin(theta - np.pi/2)     z = theta     directions = ['z', 'x', 'y']     names = [r'$\theta$', r'$\cos\theta$', r'$\sin\theta$']      fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(8, 4),                             constrained_layout=True,                             subplot_kw={'projection': '3d'})     for ax, zdir, name in zip(axs, directions, names):         ax.stem(x, y, z, orientation=zdir)         ax.set_title(name)     fig.suptitle(r'A parametric circle: $(x, y) = (\cos\theta, \sin\theta)$')  See also the [/gallery/mplot3d/stem3d_demo](/gallery/mplot3d/stem3d_demo.md) demo.  3D Collection properties are now modifiable -------------------------------------------  Previously, properties of a 3D Collection that were used for 3D effects (e.g., colors were modified to produce depth shading) could not be changed after it was created.  Now it is possible to modify all properties of 3D Collections at any time.  Panning in 3D Axes ------------------  Click and drag with the middle mouse button to pan 3D Axes.   Interactive tool improvements =============================  New ``RangeSlider``widget --------------------------  `.widgets.RangeSlider` allows for creating a slider that defines a range rather than a single value.  .. plot::      fig, ax = plt.subplots(2, 1, figsize=(5, 1))     fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.2, right=0.8)      from matplotlib.widgets import Slider, RangeSlider     Slider(ax[0], 'Slider', 0, 1)     RangeSlider(ax[1], 'RangeSlider', 0, 1)  Sliders can now snap to arbitrary values ----------------------------------------  The `~matplotlib.widgets.Slider` UI widget now accepts arrays for *valstep*. This generalizes the previous behavior by allowing the slider to snap to arbitrary values.  Pausing and Resuming Animations -------------------------------  The `.animation.Animation.pause` and `.animation.Animation.resume` methods allow you to pause and resume animations. These methods can be used as callbacks for event listeners on UI elements so that your plots can have some playback control UI.   Sphinx extensions =================``plot\_directive`*caption* option -----------------------------------  Captions were previously supported when using the`plot\_directive`directive with an external source file by specifying content::      .. plot:: path/to/plot.py          This is the caption for the plot.  The`:caption:``option allows specifying the caption for both external::      .. plot:: path/to/plot.py         :caption: This is the caption for the plot.  and inline plots::      .. plot::         :caption: This is a caption for the plot.          plt.plot([1, 2, 3])   Backend-specific improvements =============================  Consecutive rasterized draws now merged ---------------------------------------  Elements of a vector output can be individually set to rasterized, using the *rasterized* keyword argument, or `~.artist.Artist.set_rasterized()`. This can be useful to reduce file sizes. For figures with multiple raster elements they are now automatically merged into a smaller number of bitmaps where this will not effect the visual output. For cases with many elements this can result in significantly smaller file sizes.  To ensure this happens do not place vector elements between raster ones.  To inhibit this merging set``Figure.suppressComposite`to True.  Support raw/rgba frame format in`FFMpegFileWriter``-----------------------------------------------------  When using `.FFMpegFileWriter`, the  *frame_format* may now be set to``"raw"`or`"rgba"`, which may be slightly faster than an image format, as no encoding/decoding need take place between Matplotlib and FFmpeg.  nbAgg/WebAgg support middle-click and double-click --------------------------------------------------  Double click events are now supported by the nbAgg and WebAgg backends. Formerly, WebAgg would report middle-click events as right clicks, but now reports the correct button type.  nbAgg support binary communication ----------------------------------  If the web browser and notebook support binary websockets, nbAgg will now use them for slightly improved transfer of figure display.  Indexed color for PNG images in PDF files when possible -------------------------------------------------------  When PNG images have 256 colors or fewer, they are converted to indexed color before saving them in a PDF. This can result in a significant reduction in file size in some cases. This is particularly true for raster data that uses a colormap but no interpolation, such as Healpy mollview plots. Currently, this is only done for RGB images.  Improved font subsettings in PDF/PS -----------------------------------  Font subsetting in PDF and PostScript has been re-written from the embedded`ttconv\`\` C code to Python. Some composite characters and outlines may have changed slightly. This fixes ttc subsetting in PDF, and adds support for subsetting of type 3 OTF fonts, resulting in smaller files (much smaller when using CJK fonts), and avoids running into issues with type 42 embedding and certain PDF readers such as Acrobat Reader.

### Kerning added to strings in PDFs

As with text produced in the Agg backend (see \[the previous what's new entry \<whats-new-3-2-0-kerning\>\](\#the-previous-what's-new entry-\<whats-new-3-2-0-kerning\>) for examples), PDFs now include kerning in text strings.

### Fully-fractional HiDPI in QtAgg

Fully-fractional HiDPI (that is, HiDPI ratios that are not whole integers) was added in Qt 5.14, and is now supported by the QtAgg backend when using this version of Qt or newer.

### wxAgg supports fullscreen toggle

The wxAgg backend supports toggling fullscreen using the `f` shortcut, or the manager function <span class="title-ref">.FigureManagerBase.full\_screen\_toggle</span>.

## Figure and Axes creation / management

### `subplot_mosaic` supports simple Axes sharing

<span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span>, <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> support *simple* Axes sharing (i.e., only <span class="title-ref">True</span>/<span class="title-ref">False</span> may be passed to *sharex*/*sharey*). When <span class="title-ref">True</span>, tick label visibility and Axis units will be shared.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

  - mosaic = \[
    
      - \['A', \[\['B', 'C'\],  
        \['D', 'E'\]\]\],
    
    \['F', 'G'\],

\] fig = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True) ax\_dict = fig.subplot\_mosaic(mosaic, sharex=True, sharey=True) \# All Axes use these scales after this call. ax\_dict\['A'\].set(xscale='log', yscale='logit')

</div>

### Figure now has `draw_without_rendering` method

Some aspects of a figure are only determined at draw-time, such as the exact position of text artists or deferred computation like automatic data limits. If you need these values, you can use `figure.canvas.draw()` to force a full draw. However, this has side effects, sometimes requires an open file, and is doing more work than is needed.

The new <span class="title-ref">.Figure.draw\_without\_rendering</span> method runs all the updates that `draw()` does, but skips rendering the figure. It's thus more efficient if you need the updated values to configure further aspects of the figure.

### Figure `__init__` passes keyword arguments through to set

Similar to many other sub-classes of <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist</span>, the <span class="title-ref">\~.FigureBase</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.SubFigure</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure</span> classes will now pass any additional keyword arguments to <span class="title-ref">\~.Artist.set</span> to allow properties of the newly created object to be set at initialization time. For example:

    from matplotlib.figure import Figure
    fig = Figure(label='my figure')

## Plotting methods

### Add `Annulus` patch

<span class="title-ref">.Annulus</span> is a new class for drawing elliptical annuli.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.patches import Annulus

fig, ax = plt.subplots() cir = Annulus((0.5, 0.5), 0.2, 0.05, fc='g') \# circular annulus ell = Annulus((0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.3), 0.1, 45, \# elliptical fc='m', ec='b', alpha=0.5, hatch='xxx') ax.add\_patch(cir) ax.add\_patch(ell) ax.set\_aspect('equal')

</div>

### `set_data` method for `FancyArrow` patch

<span class="title-ref">.FancyArrow</span>, the patch returned by `ax.arrow`, now has a `set_data` method that allows modifying the arrow after creation, e.g., for animation.

### New arrow styles in `ArrowStyle` and `ConnectionPatch`

The new *arrow* parameter to <span class="title-ref">.ArrowStyle</span> substitutes the use of the *beginarrow* and *endarrow* parameters in the creation of arrows. It receives arrows strings like `'<-'`, `']-[`' and `']->`' instead of individual booleans.

Two new styles `']->'` and `'<-['` are also added via this mechanism. <span class="title-ref">.ConnectionPatch</span>, which accepts arrow styles though its *arrowstyle* parameter, also accepts these new styles.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 4))

ax.plot(\[0.75, 0.75\], \[0.25, 0.75\], 'ok') ax.set(xlim=(0, 1), ylim=(0, 1), title='New ArrowStyle options')

        arrowstyle='\<-\[', connectionstyle="arc3,rad=-0.05", shrinkA=5, shrinkB=5,

</div>

### Setting collection offset transform after initialization

The added <span class="title-ref">.collections.Collection.set\_offset\_transform</span> may be used to set the offset transform after initialization. This can be helpful when creating a <span class="title-ref">.collections.Collection</span> outside an Axes object, and later adding it with <span class="title-ref">.Axes.add\_collection()</span> and setting the offset transform to `Axes.transData`.

## Colors and colormaps

### Colormap registry (experimental)

Colormaps are now managed via <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.colormaps</span> (or <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.colormaps</span>), which is a <span class="title-ref">.ColormapRegistry</span>. While we are confident that the API is final, we formally mark it as experimental for 3.5 because we want to keep the option to still modify the API for 3.6 should the need arise.

Colormaps can be obtained using item access:

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    cmap = plt.colormaps['viridis']

To register new colormaps use:

    plt.colormaps.register(my_colormap)

We recommend to use the new API instead of the `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` and `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap` functions for new code. `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap` and `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap` will eventually be deprecated and removed. Within <span class="title-ref">.pyplot</span>, `plt.get_cmap()` and `plt.register_cmap()` will continue to be supported for backward compatibility.

### Image interpolation now possible at RGBA stage

Images in Matplotlib created via <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.imshow</span> are resampled to match the resolution of the current canvas. It is useful to apply an auto-aliasing filter when downsampling to reduce Moiré effects. By default, interpolation is done on the data, a norm applied, and then the colormapping performed.

However, it is often desirable for the anti-aliasing interpolation to happen in RGBA space, where the colors are interpolated rather than the data. This usually leads to colors outside the colormap, but visually blends adjacent colors, and is what browsers and other image processing software do.

A new keyword argument *interpolation\_stage* is provided for <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.imshow</span> to set the stage at which the anti-aliasing interpolation happens. The default is the current behaviour of "data", with the alternative being "rgba" for the newly-available behavior.

![Example of the interpolation stage options.](/gallery/images_contours_and_fields/images/sphx_glr_image_antialiasing_001.png)

For more details see the discussion of the new keyword argument in \[/gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/image\_antialiasing\](/gallery/images\_contours\_and\_fields/image\_antialiasing.md).

### `imshow` supports half-float arrays

The <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.imshow</span> method now supports half-float arrays, i.e., NumPy arrays with dtype `np.float16`.

### A callback registry has been added to Normalize objects

<span class="title-ref">.colors.Normalize</span> objects now have a callback registry, `callbacks`, that can be connected to by other objects to be notified when the norm is updated. The callback emits the key `changed` when the norm is modified. <span class="title-ref">.cm.ScalarMappable</span> is now a listener and will register a change when the norm's vmin, vmax or other attributes are changed.

## Titles, ticks, and labels

### Settings tick positions and labels simultaneously in `set_ticks`

<span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticks</span> (and the corresponding <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xticks</span> / <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_yticks</span>) has a new parameter *labels* allowing to set tick positions and labels simultaneously.

Previously, setting tick labels was done using <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticklabels</span> (or the corresponding <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xticklabels</span> / <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_yticklabels</span>); this usually only makes sense if tick positions were previously fixed with \`\~.Axis.set\_ticks\`:

    ax.set_xticks([1, 2, 3])
    ax.set_xticklabels(['a', 'b', 'c'])

The combined functionality is now available in \`\~.Axis.set\_ticks\`:

    ax.set_xticks([1, 2, 3], ['a', 'b', 'c'])

The use of <span class="title-ref">.Axis.set\_ticklabels</span> is discouraged, but it will stay available for backward compatibility.

Note: This addition makes the API of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axis.set\_ticks</span> also more similar to <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.xticks</span> / <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.yticks</span>, which already had the additional *labels* parameter.

## Fonts and Text

### Triple and quadruple dot mathtext accents

In addition to single and double dot accents, mathtext now supports triple and quadruple dot accents.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(3, 1)) fig.text(0.5, 0.5, r'$dot{a} ddot{b} dddot{c} ddddot{d}$', fontsize=40, horizontalalignment='center', verticalalignment='center')

</div>

### Font properties of legend title are configurable

Title's font properties can be set via the *title\_fontproperties* keyword argument, for example:

<div class="plot">

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(4, 3)) ax.plot(range(10), label='point') ax.legend(title='Points', title\_fontproperties={'family': 'serif', 'size': 20})

</div>

### `Text` and `TextBox` added *parse\_math* option

<span class="title-ref">.Text</span> and <span class="title-ref">.TextBox</span> objects now allow a *parse\_math* keyword-only argument which controls whether math should be parsed from the displayed string. If *True*, the string will be parsed as a math text object. If *False*, the string will be considered a literal and no parsing will occur.

### Text can be positioned inside TextBox widget

A new parameter called *textalignment* can be used to control for the position of the text inside the Axes of the <span class="title-ref">.TextBox</span> widget.

<div class="plot">

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt from matplotlib.widgets import TextBox

fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4, 3)) for i, alignment in enumerate(\['left', 'center', 'right'\]): box\_input = fig.add\_axes(\[0.1, 0.7 - i\*0.3, 0.8, 0.2\]) text\_box = TextBox(ax=box\_input, initial=f'{alignment} alignment', label='', textalignment=alignment)

</div>

### Simplifying the font setting for usetex mode

Now the `font.family` accepts some font names as value for a more user-friendly setup.

`` `python     plt.rcParams.update({         "text.usetex": True,         "font.family": "Helvetica"     })  Type 42 subsetting is now enabled for PDF/PS backends ``\` -----------------------------------------------------

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backends.backend\_pdf</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backends.backend\_ps</span> now use a unified Type 42 font subsetting interface, with the help of [fontTools](https://fonttools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

Set `pdf.fonttype` or `ps.fonttype` to `42` to trigger this workflow:

    # for PDF backend
    plt.rcParams['pdf.fonttype'] = 42
    
    # for PS backend
    plt.rcParams['ps.fonttype'] = 42
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    ax.text(0.4, 0.5, 'subsetted document is smaller in size!')
    
    fig.savefig("document.pdf")
    fig.savefig("document.ps")

## rcParams improvements

### Allow setting default legend labelcolor globally

A new `legend.labelcolor` sets the default *labelcolor* argument for <span class="title-ref">.Figure.legend</span>. The special values 'linecolor', 'markerfacecolor' (or 'mfc'), or 'markeredgecolor' (or 'mec') will cause the legend text to match the corresponding color of marker.

<div class="plot">

plt.rcParams\['legend.labelcolor'\] = 'linecolor'

\# Make some fake data. a = np.arange(0, 3, .02) c = np.exp(a) d = c\[::-1\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(a, c, 'g--', label='Model length') ax.plot(a, d, 'r:', label='Data length')

ax.legend()

plt.show()

</div>

## 3D Axes improvements

### Axes3D now allows manual control of draw order

The <span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D</span> class now has *computed\_zorder* parameter. When set to False, Artists are drawn using their `zorder` attribute.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.patches as mpatches from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import art3d

  - fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(6.4, 3),  
    subplot\_kw=dict(projection='3d'))

ax1.set\_title('computed\_zorder = True (default)') ax2.set\_title('computed\_zorder = False') ax2.computed\_zorder = False

corners = ((0, 0, 0), (0, 5, 0), (5, 5, 0), (5, 0, 0)) for ax in (ax1, ax2): tri = art3d.Poly3DCollection(\[corners\], facecolors='white', edgecolors='black', zorder=1) ax.add\_collection3d(tri) line, = ax.plot((2, 2), (2, 2), (0, 4), c='red', zorder=2, label='zorder=2') points = ax.scatter((3, 3), (1, 3), (1, 3), c='red', zorder=10, label='zorder=10')

> ax.set\_xlim((0, 5)) ax.set\_ylim((0, 5)) ax.set\_zlim((0, 2.5))

  - plane = mpatches.Patch(facecolor='white', edgecolor='black',  
    label='zorder=1')

fig.legend(handles=\[plane, line, points\], loc='lower center')

</div>

### Allow changing the vertical axis in 3d plots

<span class="title-ref">\~mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.axes3d.Axes3D.view\_init</span> now has the parameter *vertical\_axis* which allows switching which axis is aligned vertically.

<div class="plot">

Nphi, Nr = 18, 8 phi = np.linspace(0, np.pi, Nphi) r = np.arange(Nr) phi = np.tile(phi, Nr).flatten() r = np.repeat(r, Nphi).flatten()

x = r \* np.sin(phi) y = r \* np.cos(phi) z = Nr - r

  - fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(7, 3),  
    subplot\_kw=dict(projection='3d'), gridspec\_kw=dict(wspace=0.4, left=0.08, right=0.98, bottom=0, top=1))

  - for vert\_a, ax in zip(\['z', 'y', 'x'\], axs):  
    pc = ax.scatter(x, y, z, c=z) ax.view\_init(azim=30, elev=30, vertical\_axis=vert\_a) ax.set(xlabel='x', ylabel='y', zlabel='z', title=f'vertical\_axis={vert\_a\!r}')

</div>

### `plot_surface` supports masked arrays and NaNs

<span class="title-ref">.axes3d.Axes3D.plot\_surface</span> supports masked arrays and NaNs, and will now hide quads that contain masked or NaN points. The behaviour is similar to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contour</span> with `corner_mask=True`.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

  - fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(6, 6), subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'},  
    constrained\_layout=True)

x, y = np.mgrid\[1:10:1, 1:10:1\] z = x \*\* 3 + y \*\* 3 - 500 z = np.ma.masked\_array(z, z \< 0)

ax.plot\_surface(x, y, z, rstride=1, cstride=1, linewidth=0, cmap='inferno') ax.view\_init(35, -90)

</div>

### 3D plotting methods support *data* keyword argument

To match all 2D plotting methods, the 3D Axes now support the *data* keyword argument. This allows passing arguments indirectly from a DataFrame-like structure. :

    data = {  # A labelled data set, or e.g., Pandas DataFrame.
        'x': ...,
        'y': ...,
        'z': ...,
        'width': ...,
        'depth': ...,
        'top': ...,
    }
    
    fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot_kw={'projection': '3d')
    ax.bar3d('x', 'y', 'z', 'width', 'depth', 'top', data=data)

## Interactive tool improvements

### Colorbars now have pan and zoom functionality

Interactive plots with colorbars can now be zoomed and panned on the colorbar axis. This adjusts the *vmin* and *vmax* of the `ScalarMappable` associated with the colorbar. This is currently only enabled for continuous norms. Norms used with contourf and categoricals, such as `BoundaryNorm` and `NoNorm`, have the interactive capability disabled by default. `cb.ax.set_navigate()` can be used to set whether a colorbar axes is interactive or not.

### Updated the appearance of Slider widgets

The appearance of <span class="title-ref">\~.Slider</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.RangeSlider</span> widgets were updated and given new styling parameters for the added handles.

<div class="plot">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.widgets import Slider

plt.figure(figsize=(4, 2)) ax\_old = plt.axes(\[0.2, 0.65, 0.65, 0.1\]) ax\_new = plt.axes(\[0.2, 0.25, 0.65, 0.1\]) Slider(ax\_new, "New", 0, 1)

ax = ax\_old valmin = 0 valinit = 0.5 ax.set\_xlim(\[0, 1\]) ax\_old.axvspan(valmin, valinit, 0, 1) ax.axvline(valinit, 0, 1, color="r", lw=1) ax.set\_xticks(\[\]) ax.set\_yticks(\[\]) ax.text( -0.02, 0.5, "Old", transform=ax.transAxes, verticalalignment="center", horizontalalignment="right", )

  - ax.text(  
    1.02, 0.5, "0.5", transform=ax.transAxes, verticalalignment="center", horizontalalignment="left",

)

</div>

### Removing points on a PolygonSelector

After completing a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.PolygonSelector</span>, individual points can now be removed by right-clicking on them.

### Dragging selectors

The <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.SpanSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.EllipseSelector</span> have a new keyword argument, *drag\_from\_anywhere*, which when set to <span class="title-ref">True</span> allows you to click and drag from anywhere inside the selector to move it. Previously it was only possible to move it by either activating the move modifier button, or clicking on the central handle.

The size of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.widgets.SpanSelector</span> can now be changed using the edge handles.

### Clearing selectors

The selectors (<span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.EllipseSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.LassoSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.PolygonSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.RectangleSelector</span>, and <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.SpanSelector</span>) have a new method *clear*, which will clear the current selection and get the selector ready to make a new selection. This is equivalent to pressing the *escape* key.

### Setting artist properties of selectors

The artist properties of the <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.EllipseSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.LassoSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.PolygonSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.SpanSelector</span> selectors can be changed using the `set_props` and `set_handle_props` methods.

### Ignore events outside selection

The <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.EllipseSelector</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.RectangleSelector</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.widgets.SpanSelector</span> selectors have a new keyword argument, *ignore\_event\_outside*, which when set to <span class="title-ref">True</span> will ignore events outside of the current selection. The handles or the new dragging functionality can instead be used to change the selection.

### `CallbackRegistry` objects gain a method to temporarily block signals

The context manager <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.cbook.CallbackRegistry.blocked</span> can be used to block callback signals from being processed by the `CallbackRegistry`. The optional keyword, *signal*, can be used to block a specific signal from being processed and let all other signals pass.

`` `python     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.imshow([[0, 1], [2, 3]])      # Block all interactivity through the canvas callbacks     with fig.canvas.callbacks.blocked():         plt.show()      fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.imshow([[0, 1], [2, 3]])      # Only block key press events     with fig.canvas.callbacks.blocked(signal="key_press_event"):         plt.show()  Directional sizing cursors ``\` --------------------------

Canvases now support setting directional sizing cursors, i.e., horizontal and vertical double arrows. These are used in e.g., selector widgets. Try the \[/gallery/widgets/mouse\_cursor\](/gallery/widgets/mouse\_cursor.md) example to see the cursor in your desired backend.

## Sphinx extensions

### More configuration of `mathmpl` sphinx extension

The <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.sphinxext.mathmpl</span> sphinx extension supports two new configuration options that may be specified in your `conf.py`:

  - `mathmpl_fontsize` (float), which sets the font size of the math text in points;
  - `mathmpl_srcset` (list of str), which provides a list of sizes to support [responsive resolution images](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images) The list should contain additional x-descriptors (`'1.5x'`, `'2x'`, etc.) to generate (1x is the default and always included.)

## Backend-specific improvements

### GTK backend

A backend supporting [GTK4](https://www.gtk.org/) has been added. Both Agg and Cairo renderers are supported. The GTK4 backends may be selected as GTK4Agg or GTK4Cairo.

### Qt backends

Support for Qt6 (using either [PyQt6](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/static/Docs/PyQt6/) or [PySide6](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)) has been added, with either the Agg or Cairo renderers. Simultaneously, support for Qt4 has been dropped. Both Qt6 and Qt5 are supported by a combined backend (QtAgg or QtCairo), and the loaded version is determined by modules already imported, the `QT_API` environment variable, and available packages. See \[QT\_bindings\](\#qt\_bindings) for details. The versioned Qt5 backend names (Qt5Agg or Qt5Cairo) remain supported for backwards compatibility.

### HiDPI support in Cairo-based, GTK, and Tk backends

The GTK3 backends now support HiDPI fully, including mixed monitor cases (on Wayland only). The newly added GTK4 backends also support HiDPI.

The TkAgg backend now supports HiDPI **on Windows only**, including mixed monitor cases.

All Cairo-based backends correctly support HiDPI as well as their Agg counterparts did (i.e., if the toolkit supports HiDPI, then the \*Cairo backend will now support it, but not otherwise.)

### Qt figure options editor improvements

The figure options editor in the Qt backend now also supports editing the left and right titles (plus the existing centre title). Editing Axis limits is better supported when using a date converter. The `symlog` option is now available in Axis scaling options. All entries with the same label are now shown in the Curves tab.

### WX backends support mouse navigation buttons

The WX backends now support navigating through view states using the mouse forward/backward buttons, as in other backends.

### WebAgg uses asyncio instead of Tornado

The WebAgg backend defaults to using <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> over Tornado for timer support. This allows using the WebAgg backend in JupyterLite.

## Version information

We switched to the [release-branch-semver](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools_scm#version-number-construction) version scheme of setuptools-scm. This only affects the version information for development builds. Their version number now describes the targeted release, i.e. 3.5.0.dev820+g6768ef8c4c is 820 commits after the previous release and is scheduled to be officially released as 3.5.0 later.

In addition to the string `__version__`, there is now a namedtuple `__version_info__` as well, which is modelled after [sys.version\_info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info). Its primary use is safely comparing version information, e.g. `if __version_info__ >= (3, 4, 2)`.

## Figure and Axes creation / management

### `subplots`, `subplot_mosaic` accept *height\_ratios* and *width\_ratios* arguments

The relative width and height of columns and rows in <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.subplots</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span> can be controlled by passing *height\_ratios* and *width\_ratios* keyword arguments to the methods:

<div class="plot" alt="A figure with three subplots in three rows and one column. The height of the subplot in the first row is three times than the subplots in the 2nd and 3rd row." data-include-source="true">

fig = plt.figure() axs = fig.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True, height\_ratios=\[3, 1, 1\])

</div>

Previously, this required passing the ratios in *gridspec\_kw* arguments:

    fig = plt.figure()
    axs = fig.subplots(3, 1, sharex=True,
                       gridspec_kw=dict(height_ratios=[3, 1, 1]))

### Constrained layout is no longer considered experimental

The constrained layout engine and API is no longer considered experimental. Arbitrary changes to behaviour and API are no longer permitted without a deprecation period.

### New `layout_engine` module

Matplotlib ships with `tight_layout` and `constrained_layout` layout engines. A new <span class="title-ref">.layout\_engine</span> module is provided to allow downstream libraries to write their own layout engines and <span class="title-ref">\~.figure.Figure</span> objects can now take a <span class="title-ref">.LayoutEngine</span> subclass as an argument to the *layout* parameter.

### Compressed layout for fixed-aspect ratio Axes

Simple arrangements of Axes with fixed aspect ratios can now be packed together with `fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, layout='compressed')`.

With `layout='tight'` or `'constrained'`, Axes with a fixed aspect ratio can leave large gaps between each other:

<div class="plot" alt="A figure labelled &quot;fixed-aspect plots, layout=constrained&quot;. Figure has subplots displayed in 2 rows and 2 columns; Subplots have large gaps between each other.">

  - fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),  
    sharex=True, sharey=True, layout="constrained")

  - for ax in axs.flat:  
    ax.imshow(\[\[0, 1\], \[2, 3\]\])

fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='constrained'")

</div>

Using the `layout='compressed'` layout reduces the space between the Axes, and adds the extra space to the outer margins:

<div class="plot" alt="Four identical two by two heatmaps, each cell a different color: purple, blue, yellow, green going clockwise from upper left corner. The four heatmaps are laid out in a two by two grid with minimum white space between the heatmaps.">

  - fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, figsize=(5, 3),  
    sharex=True, sharey=True, layout='compressed')

  - for ax in axs.flat:  
    ax.imshow(\[\[0, 1\], \[2, 3\]\])

fig.suptitle("fixed-aspect plots, layout='compressed'")

</div>

See \[compressed\_layout\](\#compressed\_layout) for further details.

### Layout engines may now be removed

The layout engine on a Figure may now be removed by calling <span class="title-ref">.Figure.set\_layout\_engine</span> with `'none'`. This may be useful after computing layout in order to reduce computations, e.g., for subsequent animation loops.

A different layout engine may be set afterwards, so long as it is compatible with the previous layout engine.

### `Axes.inset_axes` flexibility

<span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes.inset\_axes</span> now accepts the *projection*, *polar* and *axes\_class* keyword arguments, so that subclasses of <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.axes.Axes</span> may be returned.

<div class="plot" alt="Plot of a straight line y=x, with a small inset axes in the lower right corner that shows a circle with radial grid lines and a line plotted in polar coordinates." data-include-source="true">

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.plot(\[0, 2\], \[1, 2\])

polar\_ax = ax.inset\_axes(\[0.75, 0.25, 0.2, 0.2\], projection='polar') polar\_ax.plot(\[0, 2\], \[1, 2\])

</div>

### WebP is now a supported output format

Figures may now be saved in WebP format by using the `.webp` file extension, or passing `format='webp'` to <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.savefig</span>. This relies on [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) support for WebP.

### Garbage collection is no longer run on figure close

Matplotlib has a large number of circular references (between Figure and Manager, between Axes and Figure, Axes and Artist, Figure and Canvas, etc.) so when the user drops their last reference to a Figure (and clears it from pyplot's state), the objects will not immediately be deleted.

To account for this we have long (since before 2004) had a <span class="title-ref">gc.collect</span> (of the lowest two generations only) in the closing code in order to promptly clean up after ourselves. However this is both not doing what we want (as most of our objects will actually survive) and due to clearing out the first generation opened us up to having unbounded memory usage.

In cases with a very tight loop between creating the figure and destroying it (e.g. `plt.figure(); plt.close()`) the first generation will never grow large enough for Python to consider running the collection on the higher generations. This will lead to unbounded memory usage as the long-lived objects are never re-considered to look for reference cycles and hence are never deleted.

We now no longer do any garbage collection when a figure is closed, and rely on Python automatically deciding to run garbage collection periodically. If you have strict memory requirements, you can call <span class="title-ref">gc.collect</span> yourself but this may have performance impacts in a tight computation loop.

## Plotting methods

### Striped lines (experimental)

The new *gapcolor* parameter to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.plot</span> enables the creation of striped lines.

<div class="plot" alt="Plot of x**3 where the line is an orange-blue striped line, achieved using the keywords linestyle=&#39;--&#39;, color=&#39;orange&#39;, gapcolor=&#39;blue&#39;" data-include-source="true">

x = np.linspace(1., 3., 10) y = x\*\*3

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(x, y, linestyle='--', color='orange', gapcolor='blue', linewidth=3, label='a striped line') ax.legend()

</div>

### Custom cap widths in box and whisker plots in `bxp` and `boxplot`

The new *capwidths* parameter to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bxp</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.boxplot</span> allows controlling the widths of the caps in box and whisker plots.

<div class="plot" alt="A box plot with capwidths 0.01 and 0.2" data-include-source="true">

x = np.linspace(-7, 7, 140) x = np.hstack(\[-25, x, 25\]) capwidths = \[0.01, 0.2\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.boxplot(\[x, x\], notch=True, capwidths=capwidths) ax.set\_title(f'{capwidths=}')

</div>

### Easier labelling of bars in bar plot

The *label* argument of <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.bar</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.barh</span> can now be passed a list of labels for the bars. The list must be the same length as *x* and labels the individual bars. Repeated labels are not de-duplicated and will cause repeated label entries, so this is best used when bars also differ in style (e.g., by passing a list to *color*, as below.)

<div class="plot" alt="Bar chart: blue bar height 10, orange bar height 20, green bar height 15 legend with blue box labeled a, orange box labeled b, and green box labeled c" data-include-source="true">

x = \["a", "b", "c"\] y = \[10, 20, 15\] color = \['C0', 'C1', 'C2'\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.bar(x, y, color=color, label=x) ax.legend()

</div>

### New style format string for colorbar ticks

The *format* argument of <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.colorbar</span> (and other colorbar methods) now accepts `{}`-style format strings.

`` `python     fig, ax = plt.subplots()     im = ax.imshow(z)     fig.colorbar(im, format='{x:.2e}')  # Instead of '%.2e'  Linestyles for negative contours may be set individually ``\` --------------------------------------------------------

The line style of negative contours may be set by passing the *negative\_linestyles* argument to <span class="title-ref">.Axes.contour</span>. Previously, this style could only be set globally via `contour.negative_linestyle`.

<div class="plot" alt="Two contour plots, each showing two positive and two negative contours. The positive contours are shown in solid black lines in both plots. In one plot the negative contours are shown in dashed lines, which is the current styling. In the other plot they&#39;re shown in dotted lines, which is one of the new options." data-include-source="true">

delta = 0.025 x = np.arange(-3.0, 3.0, delta) y = np.arange(-2.0, 2.0, delta) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) Z1 = np.exp(-X\**2 - Y2) Z2 = np.exp(-(X - 1)2 - (Y - 1)2) Z = (Z1 - Z2)* 2

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2)

CS = axs\[0\].contour(X, Y, Z, 6, colors='k') axs\[0\].clabel(CS, fontsize=9, inline=True) axs\[0\].set\_title('Default negative contours')

CS = axs\[1\].contour(X, Y, Z, 6, colors='k', negative\_linestyles='dotted') axs\[1\].clabel(CS, fontsize=9, inline=True) axs\[1\].set\_title('Dotted negative contours')

</div>

### Improved quad contour calculations via ContourPy

The contouring functions <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contour</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.contourf</span> have a new keyword argument *algorithm* to control which algorithm is used to calculate the contours. There is a choice of four algorithms to use, and the default is to use `algorithm='mpl2014'` which is the same algorithm that Matplotlib has been using since 2014.

Previously Matplotlib shipped its own C++ code for calculating the contours of quad grids. Now the external library [ContourPy](https://github.com/contourpy/contourpy) is used instead.

Other possible values of the *algorithm* keyword argument at this time are `'mpl2005'`, `'serial'` and `'threaded'`; see the [ContourPy documentation](https://contourpy.readthedocs.io) for further details.

\> **Note** \> Contour lines and polygons produced by `algorithm='mpl2014'` will be the same as those produced before this change to within floating-point tolerance. The exception is for duplicate points, i.e. contours containing adjacent (x, y) points that are identical; previously the duplicate points were removed, now they are kept. Contours affected by this will produce the same visual output, but there will be a greater number of points in the contours.

> The locations of contour labels obtained by using <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.clabel</span> may also be different.

### `errorbar` supports *markerfacecoloralt*

The *markerfacecoloralt* parameter is now passed to the line plotter from <span class="title-ref">.Axes.errorbar</span>. The documentation now accurately lists which properties are passed to <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span>, rather than claiming that all keyword arguments are passed on.

<div class="plot" alt="Graph with error bar showing ±0.2 error on the x-axis, and ±0.4 error on the y-axis. Error bar marker is a circle radius 20. Error bar face color is blue." data-include-source="true">

x = np.arange(0.1, 4, 0.5) y = np.exp(-x)

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.errorbar(x, y, xerr=0.2, yerr=0.4, linestyle=':', color='darkgrey', marker='o', markersize=20, fillstyle='left', markerfacecolor='tab:blue', markerfacecoloralt='tab:orange', markeredgecolor='tab:brown', markeredgewidth=2)

</div>

### `streamplot` can disable streamline breaks

It is now possible to specify that streamplots have continuous, unbroken streamlines. Previously streamlines would end to limit the number of lines within a single grid cell. See the difference between the plots below:

<div class="plot" alt="A figure with two streamplots. First streamplot has broken streamlines. Second streamplot has continuous streamlines.">

w = 3 Y, X = np.mgrid\[-w:w:100j, -w:w:100j\] U = -1 - X\**2 + Y V = 1 + X - Y2 speed = np.sqrt(U2 + V*\*2)

fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True)

ax0.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, broken\_streamlines=True) ax0.set\_title('broken\_streamlines=True')

ax1.streamplot(X, Y, U, V, broken\_streamlines=False) ax1.set\_title('broken\_streamlines=False')

</div>

### New axis scale `asinh` (experimental)

The new `asinh` axis scale offers an alternative to `symlog` that smoothly transitions between the quasi-linear and asymptotically logarithmic regions of the scale. This is based on an arcsinh transformation that allows plotting both positive and negative values that span many orders of magnitude.

<div class="plot" alt="Figure with 2 subplots. Subplot on the left uses symlog scale on the y axis. The transition at -2 is not smooth. Subplot on the right use asinh scale. The transition at -2 is smooth.">

fig, (ax0, ax1) = plt.subplots(1, 2, sharex=True) x = np.linspace(-3, 6, 100)

ax0.plot(x, x) ax0.set\_yscale('symlog') ax0.grid() ax0.set\_title('symlog')

ax1.plot(x, x) ax1.set\_yscale('asinh') ax1.grid() ax1.set\_title(r'$sinh^{-1}$')

  - for p in (-2, 2):
    
      - for ax in (ax0, ax1):
        
          - c = plt.Circle((p, p), radius=0.5, fill=False,  
            color='red', alpha=0.8, lw=3)
        
        ax.add\_patch(c)

</div>

### `stairs(..., fill=True)` hides patch edge by setting linewidth

`stairs(..., fill=True)` would previously hide Patch edges by setting `edgecolor="none"`. Consequently, calling `set_color()` on the Patch later would make the Patch appear larger.

Now, by using `linewidth=0`, this apparent size change is prevented. Likewise calling `stairs(..., fill=True, linewidth=3)` will behave more transparently.

### Fix the dash offset of the Patch class

Formerly, when setting the line style on a <span class="title-ref">.Patch</span> object using a dash tuple, the offset was ignored. Now the offset is applied to the Patch as expected and it can be used as it is used with <span class="title-ref">.Line2D</span> objects.

### Rectangle patch rotation point

The rotation point of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.patches.Rectangle</span> can now be set to 'xy', 'center' or a 2-tuple of numbers using the *rotation\_point* argument.

<div class="plot" alt="Blue square that isn&#39;t rotated. Green square rotated 45 degrees relative to center. Orange square rotated 45 degrees relative to lower right corner. Red square rotated 45 degrees relative to point in upper right quadrant.">

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

rect = plt.Rectangle((0, 0), 1, 1, facecolor='none', edgecolor='C0') ax.add\_patch(rect) ax.annotate('Unrotated', (1, 0), color='C0', horizontalalignment='right', verticalalignment='top', xytext=(0, -3), textcoords='offset points')

  - for rotation\_point, color in zip(\['xy', 'center', (0.75, 0.25)\],  
    \['C1', 'C2', 'C3'\]): ax.add\_patch( plt.Rectangle((0, 0), 1, 1, facecolor='none', edgecolor=color, angle=45, rotation\_point=rotation\_point))
    
    if rotation\_point == 'center': point = 0.5, 0.5 elif rotation\_point == 'xy': point = 0, 0 else: point = rotation\_point ax.plot(point\[:1\], point\[1:\], color=color, marker='o')
    
    label = f'{rotation\_point}' if label == 'xy': label += ' (default)' ax.annotate(label, point, color=color, xytext=(3, 3), textcoords='offset points')

ax.set\_aspect(1) ax.set\_title('rotation\_point options')

</div>

## Colors and colormaps

### Color sequence registry

The color sequence registry, <span class="title-ref">.ColorSequenceRegistry</span>, contains sequences (i.e., simple lists) of colors that are known to Matplotlib by name. This will not normally be used directly, but through the universal instance at <span class="title-ref">matplotlib.color\_sequences</span>.

### Colormap method for creating a different lookup table size

The new method <span class="title-ref">.Colormap.resampled</span> creates a new <span class="title-ref">.Colormap</span> instance with the specified lookup table size. This is a replacement for manipulating the lookup table size via `get_cmap`.

Use:

    get_cmap(name).resampled(N)

instead of:

    get_cmap(name, lut=N)

### Setting norms with strings

Norms can now be set (e.g. on images) using the string name of the corresponding scale, e.g. `imshow(array, norm="log")`. Note that in that case, it is permissible to also pass *vmin* and *vmax*, as a new Norm instance will be created under the hood.

## Titles, ticks, and labels

### `plt.xticks` and `plt.yticks` support *minor* keyword argument

It is now possible to set or get minor ticks using <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.xticks</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.yticks</span> by setting `minor=True`.

<div class="plot" alt="Plot showing a line from 1,2 to 3.5,-0.5. X axis showing the 1, 2 and 3 minor ticks on the x axis as One, Zwei, Trois." data-include-source="true">

plt.figure() plt.plot(\[1, 2, 3, 3.5\], \[2, 1, 0, -0.5\]) plt.xticks(\[1, 2, 3\], \["One", "Zwei", "Trois"\]) plt.xticks(\[np.sqrt(2), 2.5, np.pi\], \[r"$sqrt{2}$", r"$frac{5}{2}$", r"$pi$"\], minor=True)

</div>

## Legends

### Legend can control alignment of title and handles

<span class="title-ref">.Legend</span> now supports controlling the alignment of the title and handles via the keyword argument *alignment*. You can also use <span class="title-ref">.Legend.set\_alignment</span> to control the alignment on existing Legends.

<div class="plot" alt="Figure with 3 subplots. All the subplots are titled test. The three subplots have legends titled alignment=&#39;left&#39;, alignment=&#39;center&#39;, alignment=&#39;right&#39;. The legend texts are respectively aligned left, center and right." data-include-source="true">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1) for i, alignment in enumerate(\['left', 'center', 'right'\]): axs\[i\].plot(range(10), label='test') axs\[i\].legend(title=f'{alignment=}', alignment=alignment)

</div>

### *ncol* keyword argument to `legend` renamed to *ncols*

The *ncol* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.legend</span> for controlling the number of columns is renamed to *ncols* for consistency with the *ncols* and *nrows* keywords of <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.subplots</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.GridSpec</span>. *ncol* remains supported for backwards compatibility, but is discouraged.

## Markers

### `marker` can now be set to the string "none"

The string "none" means *no-marker*, consistent with other APIs which support the lowercase version. Using "none" is recommended over using "None", to avoid confusion with the None object.

### Customization of `MarkerStyle` join and cap style

New <span class="title-ref">.MarkerStyle</span> parameters allow control of join style and cap style, and for the user to supply a transformation to be applied to the marker (e.g. a rotation).

<div class="plot" alt="Three rows of markers, columns are blue, green, and purple. First row is y-shaped markers with different capstyles: butt, end is squared off at endpoint; projecting, end is squared off at short distance from endpoint; round, end is rounded. Second row is star-shaped markers with different join styles: miter, star points are sharp triangles; round, star points are rounded; bevel, star points are beveled. Last row shows stars rotated at different angles: small star rotated 0 degrees - top point vertical; medium star rotated 45 degrees - top point tilted right; large star rotated 90 degrees - top point tilted left." data-include-source="true">

from matplotlib.markers import CapStyle, JoinStyle, MarkerStyle from matplotlib.transforms import Affine2D

fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 1, layout='constrained') for ax in axs: ax.axis('off') ax.set\_xlim(-0.5, 2.5)

axs\[0\].set\_title('Cap styles', fontsize=14) for col, cap in enumerate(CapStyle): axs\[0\].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=8, marker=MarkerStyle('1', capstyle=cap)) \# Show the marker edge for comparison with the cap. axs\[0\].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=1, markerfacecolor='none', markeredgecolor='lightgrey', marker=MarkerStyle('1')) axs\[0\].annotate(cap.name, (col, 0), xytext=(20, -5), textcoords='offset points')

axs\[1\].set\_title('Join styles', fontsize=14) for col, join in enumerate(JoinStyle): axs\[1\].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=8, marker=MarkerStyle('*', joinstyle=join)) \# Show the marker edge for comparison with the join. axs\[1\].plot(col, 0, markersize=32, markeredgewidth=1, markerfacecolor='none', markeredgecolor='lightgrey', marker=MarkerStyle('*')) axs\[1\].annotate(join.name, (col, 0), xytext=(20, -5), textcoords='offset points')

axs\[2\].set\_title('Arbitrary transforms', fontsize=14) for col, (size, rot) in enumerate(zip(\[2, 5, 7\], \[0, 45, 90\])): t = Affine2D().rotate\_deg(rot).scale(size) axs\[2\].plot(col, 0, marker=MarkerStyle('\*', transform=t))

</div>

## Fonts and Text

### Font fallback

It is now possible to specify a list of fonts families and Matplotlib will try them in order to locate a required glyph.

<div class="plot" data-caption="Demonstration of mixed English and Chinese text with font fallback." alt="The phrase &quot;There are 几个汉字 in between!&quot; rendered in various fonts." data-include-source="True">

plt.rcParams\["font.size"\] = 20 fig = plt.figure(figsize=(4.75, 1.85))

text = "There are 几个汉字 in between\!" fig.text(0.05, 0.65, text, family=\["Noto Sans CJK JP", "Noto Sans TC"\]) fig.text(0.05, 0.45, text, family=\["DejaVu Sans", "Noto Sans CJK JP", "Noto Sans TC"\])

</div>

This currently works with the Agg (and all of the GUI embeddings), svg, pdf, ps, and inline backends.

### List of available font names

The list of available fonts are now easily accessible. To get a list of the available font names in Matplotlib use:

`` `python     from matplotlib import font_manager     font_manager.get_font_names() ``math\_to\_image`now has a *color* keyword argument`\` ----------------------------------------------------

To easily support external libraries that rely on the MathText rendering of Matplotlib to generate equation images, a *color* keyword argument was added to <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.mathtext.math\_to\_image</span>.

`` `python     from matplotlib import mathtext     mathtext.math_to_image('$x^2$', 'filename.png', color='Maroon')  Active URL area rotates with link text ``\` --------------------------------------

When link text is rotated in a figure, the active URL area will now include the rotated link area. Previously, the active area remained in the original, non-rotated, position.

## rcParams improvements

### Allow setting figure label size and weight globally and separately from title

For figure labels, `Figure.supxlabel` and `Figure.supylabel`, the size and weight can be set separately from the figure title using `figure.labelsize` and `figure.labelweight`.

<div class="plot" alt="A figure with 4 plots organised in 2 rows and 2 columns. The title of the figure is suptitle in bold and 64 points. The x axis is labelled supxlabel, and y axis is labelled subylabel. Both labels are 32 points and bold." data-include-source="true">

\# Original (previously combined with below) rcParams: plt.rcParams\['figure.titlesize'\] = 64 plt.rcParams\['figure.titleweight'\] = 'bold'

\# New rcParams: plt.rcParams\['figure.labelsize'\] = 32 plt.rcParams\['figure.labelweight'\] = 'bold'

fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, layout='constrained') for ax in axs.flat: ax.set(xlabel='xlabel', ylabel='ylabel')

fig.suptitle('suptitle') fig.supxlabel('supxlabel') fig.supylabel('supylabel')

</div>

Note that if you have changed `figure.titlesize` or `figure.titleweight`, you must now also change the introduced parameters for a result consistent with past behaviour.

### Mathtext parsing can be disabled globally

The `text.parse_math` setting may be used to disable parsing of mathtext in all <span class="title-ref">.Text</span> objects (most notably from the <span class="title-ref">.Axes.text</span> method).

### Double-quoted strings in matplotlibrc

You can now use double-quotes around strings. This allows using the '\#' character in strings. Without quotes, '\#' is interpreted as start of a comment. In particular, you can now define hex-colors:

`` `none    grid.color: "#b0b0b0"  3D Axes improvements ``\` ====================

### Standardized views for primary plane viewing angles

When viewing a 3D plot in one of the primary view planes (i.e., perpendicular to the XY, XZ, or YZ planes), the Axis will be displayed in a standard location. For further information on 3D views, see \[toolkit\_mplot3d-view-angles\](\#toolkit\_mplot3d-view-angles) and \[/gallery/mplot3d/view\_planes\_3d\](/gallery/mplot3d/view\_planes\_3d.md).

### Custom focal length for 3D camera

The 3D Axes can now better mimic real-world cameras by specifying the focal length of the virtual camera. The default focal length of 1 corresponds to a Field of View (FOV) of 90°, and is backwards-compatible with existing 3D plots. An increased focal length between 1 and infinity "flattens" the image, while a decreased focal length between 1 and 0 exaggerates the perspective and gives the image more apparent depth.

The focal length can be calculated from a desired FOV via the equation:

<div class="mathmpl">

focal\_length = 1/tan(FOV/2)

</div>

<div class="plot" alt="A figure showing 3 basic 3D Wireframe plots. From left to right, the plots use focal length of 0.2, 1 and infinity. Focal length between 0.2 and 1 produce plot with depth while focal length between 1 and infinity show relatively flattened image." data-include-source="true">

from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

X, Y, Z = axes3d.get\_test\_data(0.05)

  - fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(7, 4),  
    subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'})

  - for ax, focal\_length in zip(axs, \[0.2, 1, np.inf\]):  
    ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=10) ax.set\_proj\_type('persp', focal\_length=focal\_length) ax.set\_title(f"{focal\_length=}")

</div>

### 3D plots gained a 3rd "roll" viewing angle

3D plots can now be viewed from any orientation with the addition of a 3rd roll angle, which rotates the plot about the viewing axis. Interactive rotation using the mouse still only controls elevation and azimuth, meaning that this feature is relevant to users who create more complex camera angles programmatically. The default roll angle of 0 is backwards-compatible with existing 3D plots.

<div class="plot" alt="View of a wireframe of a 3D contour that is somewhat a thickened s shape. Elevation and azimuth are 0 degrees so the shape is viewed straight on, but tilted because the roll is 30 degrees." data-include-source="true">

from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d import axes3d

X, Y, Z = axes3d.get\_test\_data(0.05)

fig, ax = plt.subplots(subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'})

ax.plot\_wireframe(X, Y, Z, rstride=10, cstride=10) ax.view\_init(elev=0, azim=0, roll=30) ax.set\_title('elev=0, azim=0, roll=30')

</div>

### Equal aspect ratio for 3D plots

Users can set the aspect ratio for the X, Y, Z axes of a 3D plot to be 'equal', 'equalxy', 'equalxz', or 'equalyz' rather than the default of 'auto'.

<div class="plot" alt="Five plots, each showing a different aspect option for a rectangle that has height 4, depth 1, and width 1. auto: none of the dimensions have equal aspect, depth and width form a rectangular and height appears shrunken in proportion. equal: all the dimensions have equal aspect. equalxy: width and depth equal, height not so looks shrunken in proportion. equalyz: depth and height equal, width not so elongated. equalxz: width and height equal, depth not so elongated." data-include-source="true">

from itertools import combinations, product

  - aspects = \[  
    \['auto', 'equal', '.'\], \['equalxy', 'equalyz', 'equalxz'\],

\] fig, axs = plt.subplot\_mosaic(aspects, figsize=(7, 6), subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'})

\# Draw rectangular cuboid with side lengths \[1, 1, 5\] r = \[0, 1\] scale = np.array(\[1, 1, 5\]) pts = combinations(np.array(list(product(r, r, r))), 2) for start, end in pts: if np.sum(np.abs(start - end)) == r\[1\] - r\[0\]: for ax in axs.values(): ax.plot3D(*zip(start*scale, end\*scale), color='C0')

\# Set the aspect ratios for aspect, ax in axs.items(): ax.set\_box\_aspect((3, 4, 5)) ax.set\_aspect(aspect) ax.set\_title(f'set\_aspect({aspect\!r})')

</div>

## Interactive tool improvements

### Rotation, aspect ratio correction and add/remove state

The <span class="title-ref">.RectangleSelector</span> and <span class="title-ref">.EllipseSelector</span> can now be rotated interactively between -45° and 45°. The range limits are currently dictated by the implementation. The rotation is enabled or disabled by striking the *r* key ('r' is the default key mapped to 'rotate' in *state\_modifier\_keys*) or by calling `selector.add_state('rotate')`.

The aspect ratio of the axes can now be taken into account when using the "square" state. This is enabled by specifying `use_data_coordinates='True'` when the selector is initialized.

In addition to changing selector state interactively using the modifier keys defined in *state\_modifier\_keys*, the selector state can now be changed programmatically using the *add\_state* and *remove\_state* methods.

`` `python     from matplotlib.widgets import RectangleSelector      values = np.arange(0, 100)      fig = plt.figure()     ax = fig.add_subplot()     ax.plot(values, values)      selector = RectangleSelector(ax, print, interactive=True,                                  drag_from_anywhere=True,                                  use_data_coordinates=True)     selector.add_state('rotate')  # alternatively press 'r' key     # rotate the selector interactively      selector.remove_state('rotate')  # alternatively press 'r' key      selector.add_state('square') ``MultiCursor`now supports Axes split over multiple figures`\` -------------------------------------------------------------

Previously, <span class="title-ref">.MultiCursor</span> only worked if all target Axes belonged to the same figure.

As a consequence of this change, the first argument to the <span class="title-ref">.MultiCursor</span> constructor has become unused (it was previously the joint canvas of all Axes, but the canvases are now directly inferred from the list of Axes).

### `PolygonSelector` bounding boxes

<span class="title-ref">.PolygonSelector</span> now has a *draw\_bounding\_box* argument, which when set to <span class="title-ref">True</span> will draw a bounding box around the polygon once it is complete. The bounding box can be resized and moved, allowing the points of the polygon to be easily resized.

### Setting `PolygonSelector` vertices

The vertices of <span class="title-ref">.PolygonSelector</span> can now be set programmatically by using the <span class="title-ref">.PolygonSelector.verts</span> property. Setting the vertices this way will reset the selector, and create a new complete selector with the supplied vertices.

### `SpanSelector` widget can now be snapped to specified values

The <span class="title-ref">.SpanSelector</span> widget can now be snapped to values specified by the *snap\_values* argument.

### More toolbar icons are styled for dark themes

On the macOS and Tk backends, toolbar icons will now be inverted when using a dark theme.

## Platform-specific changes

### Wx backend uses standard toolbar

Instead of a custom sizer, the toolbar is set on Wx windows as a standard toolbar.

### Improvements to macosx backend

#### Modifier keys handled more consistently

The macosx backend now handles modifier keys in a manner more consistent with other backends. See the table in \[event-connections\](\#event-connections) for further information.

#### `savefig.directory` rcParam support

The macosx backend will now obey the `savefig.directory` setting. If set to a non-empty string, then the save dialog will default to this directory, and preserve subsequent save directories as they are changed.

#### `figure.raise_window` rcParam support

The macosx backend will now obey the `figure.raise_window` setting. If set to False, figure windows will not be raised to the top on update.

#### Full-screen toggle support

As supported on other backends, the macosx backend now supports toggling fullscreen view. By default, this view can be toggled by pressing the `f` key.

#### Improved animation and blitting support

The macosx backend has been improved to fix blitting, animation frames with new artists, and to reduce unnecessary draw calls.

### macOS application icon applied on Qt backend

When using the Qt-based backends on macOS, the application icon will now be set, as is done on other backends/platforms.

### New minimum macOS version

The macosx backend now requires macOS \>= 10.12.

### Windows on ARM support

Preliminary support for Windows on arm64 target has been added. This support requires FreeType 2.11 or above.

No binary wheels are available yet but it may be built from source.

## Plotting and Annotation improvements

### `hatch` parameter for pie

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.pie</span> now accepts a *hatch* keyword that takes as input a hatch or list of hatches:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true" alt="Two pie charts, identified as ax1 and ax2, both have a small blue slice, a medium orange slice, and a large green slice. ax1 has a dot hatching on the small slice, a small open circle hatching on the medium slice, and a large open circle hatching on the large slice. ax2 has the same large open circle with a dot hatch on every slice.">

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2) x = \[10, 30, 60\]

ax1.pie(x, hatch=\['.', 'o', 'O'\]) ax2.pie(x, hatch='.O')

ax1.set\_title("hatch=\['.', 'o', 'O'\]") ax2.set\_title("hatch='.O'")

</div>

### Polar plot errors drawn in polar coordinates

Caps and error lines are now drawn with respect to polar coordinates, when plotting errorbars on polar plots.

![](/gallery/pie_and_polar_charts/images/sphx_glr_polar_error_caps_001.png)

### Additional format string options in <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar\_label</span>

The `fmt` argument of <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.bar\_label</span> now accepts {}-style format strings:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

fruit\_names = \['Coffee', 'Salted Caramel', 'Pistachio'\] fruit\_counts = \[4000, 2000, 7000\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() bar\_container = ax.bar(fruit\_names, fruit\_counts) ax.set(ylabel='pints sold', title='Gelato sales by flavor', ylim=(0, 8000)) ax.bar\_label(bar\_container, fmt='{:,.0f}')

</div>

It also accepts callables:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

animal\_names = \['Lion', 'Gazelle', 'Cheetah'\] mph\_speed = \[50, 60, 75\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() bar\_container = ax.bar(animal\_names, mph\_speed) ax.set(ylabel='speed in MPH', title='Running speeds', ylim=(0, 80)) ax.bar\_label( bar\_container, fmt=lambda x: '{:.1f} km/h'.format(x \* 1.61) )

</div>

### `ellipse` boxstyle option for annotations

The `'ellipse'` option for boxstyle can now be used to create annotations with an elliptical outline. It can be used as a closed curve shape for longer texts instead of the `'circle'` boxstyle which can get quite big.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(5, 5)) t = ax.text(0.5, 0.5, "elliptical box", ha="center", size=15, bbox=dict(boxstyle="ellipse,pad=0.3"))

</div>

### The *extent* of `imshow` can now be expressed with units

The *extent* parameter of <span class="title-ref">\~.axes.Axes.imshow</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.AxesImage.set\_extent</span> can now be expressed with units.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout='constrained') date\_first = np.datetime64('2020-01-01', 'D') date\_last = np.datetime64('2020-01-11', 'D')

arr = \[\[i+j for i in range(10)\] for j in range(10)\]

ax.imshow(arr, origin='lower', extent=\[0, 10, date\_first, date\_last\])

plt.show()

</div>

### Reversed order of legend entries

The order of legend entries can now be reversed by passing `reverse=True` to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.legend</span>.

### `pcolormesh` accepts RGB(A) colors

The <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span> method can now handle explicit colors specified with RGB(A) values. To specify colors, the array must be 3D with a shape of `(M, N, [3, 4])`.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

colors = np.linspace(0, 1, 90).reshape((5, 6, 3)) plt.pcolormesh(colors) plt.show()

</div>

### View current appearance settings for ticks, tick labels, and gridlines

The new <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axis.Axis.get\_tick\_params</span> method can be used to retrieve the appearance settings that will be applied to any additional ticks, tick labels, and gridlines added to the plot:

`` `pycon     >>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt      >>> fig, ax = plt.subplots()     >>> ax.yaxis.set_tick_params(labelsize=30, labelcolor='red',     ...                          direction='out', which='major')     >>> ax.yaxis.get_tick_params(which='major')     {'direction': 'out',     'left': True,     'right': False,     'labelleft': True,     'labelright': False,     'gridOn': False,     'labelsize': 30,     'labelcolor': 'red'}     >>> ax.yaxis.get_tick_params(which='minor')     {'left': True,     'right': False,     'labelleft': True,     'labelright': False,     'gridOn': False}    Style files can be imported from third-party packages ``\` -----------------------------------------------------

Third-party packages can now distribute style files that are globally available as follows. Assume that a package is importable as `import mypackage`, with a `mypackage/__init__.py` module. Then a `mypackage/presentation.mplstyle` style sheet can be used as `plt.style.use("mypackage.presentation")`.

The implementation does not actually import `mypackage`, making this process safe against possible import-time side effects. Subpackages (e.g. `dotted.package.name`) are also supported.

## Improvements to 3D Plotting

### 3D plot pan and zoom buttons

The pan and zoom buttons in the toolbar of 3D plots are now enabled. Unselect both to rotate the plot. When the zoom button is pressed, zoom in by using the left mouse button to draw a bounding box, and out by using the right mouse button to draw the box. When zooming a 3D plot, the current view aspect ratios are kept fixed.

### *adjustable* keyword argument for setting equal aspect ratios in 3D

While setting equal aspect ratios for 3D plots, users can choose to modify either the data limits or the bounding box in parity with 2D Axes.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np from itertools import combinations, product

aspects = ('auto', 'equal', 'equalxy', 'equalyz', 'equalxz') fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, len(aspects), subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'}, figsize=(12, 6))

\# Draw rectangular cuboid with side lengths \[4, 3, 5\] r = \[0, 1\] scale = np.array(\[4, 3, 5\]) pts = combinations(np.array(list(product(r, r, r))), 2) for start, end in pts: if np.sum(np.abs(start - end)) == r\[1\] - r\[0\]: for ax in axs: ax.plot3D(*zip(start*scale, end\*scale), color='C0')

\# Set the aspect ratios for i, ax in enumerate(axs): ax.set\_aspect(aspects\[i\], adjustable='datalim') \# Alternatively: ax.set\_aspect(aspects\[i\], adjustable='box') \# which will change the box aspect ratio instead of axis data limits. ax.set\_title(f"set\_aspect('{aspects\[i\]}')")

plt.show()

</div>

### `Poly3DCollection` supports shading

It is now possible to shade a <span class="title-ref">.Poly3DCollection</span>. This is useful if the polygons are obtained from e.g. a 3D model.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from mpl\_toolkits.mplot3d.art3d import Poly3DCollection

\# Define 3D shape block = np.array(\[ \[\[1, 1, 0\], \[1, 0, 0\], \[0, 1, 0\]\], \[\[1, 1, 0\], \[1, 1, 1\], \[1, 0, 0\]\], \[\[1, 1, 0\], \[1, 1, 1\], \[0, 1, 0\]\], \[\[1, 0, 0\], \[1, 1, 1\], \[0, 1, 0\]\] \])

ax = plt.subplot(projection='3d') pc = Poly3DCollection(block, facecolors='b', shade=True) ax.add\_collection(pc) plt.show()

</div>

### rcParam for 3D pane color

The rcParams `axes3d.xaxis.panecolor`, `axes3d.yaxis.panecolor`, `axes3d.zaxis.panecolor` can be used to change the color of the background panes in 3D plots. Note that it is often beneficial to give them slightly different shades to obtain a "3D effect" and to make them slightly transparent (alpha \< 1).

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt with plt.rc\_context({'axes3d.xaxis.panecolor': (0.9, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5), 'axes3d.yaxis.panecolor': (0.7, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5), 'axes3d.zaxis.panecolor': (0.8, 0.0, 0.0, 0.5)}): fig = plt.figure() fig.add\_subplot(projection='3d')

</div>

## Figure and Axes Layout

### `colorbar` now has a *location* keyword argument

The `colorbar` method now supports a *location* keyword argument to more easily position the color bar. This is useful when providing your own inset axes using the *cax* keyword argument and behaves similar to the case where axes are not provided (where the *location* keyword is passed through). *orientation* and *ticklocation* are no longer required as they are determined by *location*. *ticklocation* can still be provided if the automatic setting is not preferred. (*orientation* can also be provided but must be compatible with the *location*.)

An example is:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np rng = np.random.default\_rng(19680801) imdata = rng.random((10, 10)) fig, ax = plt.subplots(layout='constrained') im = ax.imshow(imdata) fig.colorbar(im, cax=ax.inset\_axes(\[0, 1.05, 1, 0.05\]), location='top')

</div>

### Figure legends can be placed outside figures using constrained\_layout

Constrained layout will make space for Figure legends if they are specified by a *loc* keyword argument that starts with the string "outside". The codes are unique from axes codes, in that "outside upper right" will make room at the top of the figure for the legend, whereas "outside right upper" will make room on the right-hand side of the figure. See \[legend\_guide\](\#legend\_guide) for details.

### Per-subplot keyword arguments in `subplot_mosaic`

It is now possible to pass keyword arguments through to Axes creation in each specific call to `add_subplot` in <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> :

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

  - fig, axd = plt.subplot\_mosaic(  
    "AB;CD", per\_subplot\_kw={ "A": {"projection": "polar"}, ("C", "D"): {"xscale": "log"}, "B": {"projection": "3d"}, },

)

</div>

This is particularly useful for creating mosaics with mixed projections, but any keyword arguments can be passed through.

### `subplot_mosaic` no longer provisional

The API on <span class="title-ref">.Figure.subplot\_mosaic</span> and <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.subplot\_mosaic</span> are now considered stable and will change under Matplotlib's normal deprecation process.

## Widget Improvements

### Custom styling of button widgets

Additional custom styling of button widgets may be achieved via the *label\_props* and *radio\_props* arguments to <span class="title-ref">.RadioButtons</span>; and the *label\_props*, *frame\_props*, and *check\_props* arguments to <span class="title-ref">.CheckButtons</span>.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

from matplotlib.widgets import CheckButtons, RadioButtons

fig, ax = plt.subplots(nrows=2, ncols=2, figsize=(5, 2), width\_ratios=\[1, 2\]) default\_rb = RadioButtons(ax\[0, 0\], \['Apples', 'Oranges'\]) styled\_rb = RadioButtons(ax\[0, 1\], \['Apples', 'Oranges'\], label\_props={'color': \['red', 'orange'\], 'fontsize': \[16, 20\]}, radio\_props={'edgecolor': \['red', 'orange'\], 'facecolor': \['mistyrose', 'peachpuff'\]})

  - default\_cb = CheckButtons(ax\[1, 0\], \['Apples', 'Oranges'\],  
    actives=\[True, True\])

  - styled\_cb = CheckButtons(ax\[1, 1\], \['Apples', 'Oranges'\],  
    actives=\[True, True\], label\_props={'color': \['red', 'orange'\], 'fontsize': \[16, 20\]}, frame\_props={'edgecolor': \['red', 'orange'\], 'facecolor': \['mistyrose', 'peachpuff'\]}, check\_props={'color': \['darkred', 'darkorange'\]})

ax\[0, 0\].set\_title('Default') ax\[0, 1\].set\_title('Stylized')

</div>

### Blitting in Button widgets

The <span class="title-ref">.Button</span>, <span class="title-ref">.CheckButtons</span>, and <span class="title-ref">.RadioButtons</span> widgets now support blitting for faster rendering, on backends that support it, by passing `useblit=True` to the constructor. Blitting is enabled by default on supported backends.

## Other Improvements

### Source links can be shown or hidden for each Sphinx plot directive

The \[Sphinx plot directive \</api/sphinxext\_plot\_directive\_api\>\](Sphinx plot directive \</api/sphinxext\_plot\_directive\_api\>.md) (`.. plot::`) now supports a `:show-source-link:` option to show or hide the link to the source code for each plot. The default is set using the `plot_html_show_source_link` variable in `conf.py` (which defaults to True).

### Figure hooks

The new `figure.hooks` provides a mechanism to register arbitrary customizations on pyplot figures; it is a list of "dotted.module.name:dotted.callable.name" strings specifying functions that are called on each figure created by <span class="title-ref">.pyplot.figure</span>; these functions can e.g. attach callbacks or modify the toolbar. See \[/gallery/user\_interfaces/mplcvd\](/gallery/user\_interfaces/mplcvd.md) for an example of toolbar customization.

## New & Improved Narrative Documentation

  - Brand new \[Animations \<animations\>\](\#animations-\<animations\>) tutorial.
  - New grouped and stacked [bar chart](../../gallery/index.html#lines_bars_and_markers) examples.
  - New section for new contributors and reorganized git instructions in the \[contributing guide\<contributing\>\](\#contributing-guide\<contributing\>).
  - Restructured \[annotations\](\#annotations) tutorial.

## Type Hints

Matplotlib now provides first-party PEP484 style type hints files for most public APIs.

While still considered provisional and subject to change (and sometimes we are not quite able to fully specify what we would like to), they should provide a reasonable basis to type check many common usage patterns, as well as integrating with many editors/IDEs.

## Plotting and Annotation improvements

### Support customizing antialiasing for text and annotation

`matplotlib.pyplot.annotate()` and `matplotlib.pyplot.text()` now support parameter *antialiased*. When *antialiased* is set to `True`, antialiasing will be applied to the text. When *antialiased* is set to `False`, antialiasing will not be applied to the text. When *antialiased* is not specified, antialiasing will be set by `text.antialiased` at the creation time of `Text` and `Annotation` object. Examples:

`` `python     mpl.text.Text(.5, .5, "foo\nbar", antialiased=True)     plt.text(0.5, 0.5, '6 inches x 2 inches', antialiased=True)     ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5), antialiased=False)  If the text contains math expression, *antialiased* applies to the whole text. ``\` Examples:

`` `python     # no part will be antialiased for the text below     plt.text(0.5, 0.25, r"$I'm \sqrt{x}$", antialiased=False)  Also note that antialiasing for tick labels will be set with :rc:`text.antialiased` when they are created (usually when a ``Figure`is created) and cannot be changed afterwards.  Furthermore, with this new feature, you may want to make sure that you are creating and saving/showing the figure under the same context::      # previously this was a no-op, now it is what works     with rccontext(text.antialiased=False):         fig, ax = plt.subplots()         ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5))         fig.savefig('/tmp/test.png')       # previously this had an effect, now this is a no-op     fig, ax = plt.subplots()     ax.annotate('local max', xy=(2, 1), xytext=(3, 1.5))     with rccontext(text.antialiased=False):         fig.savefig('/tmp/test.png')  rcParams for`AutoMinorLocator`divisions`<span class="title-ref"> ------------------------------------------- The rcParams :rc:\`xtick.minor.ndivs</span> and `ytick.minor.ndivs` have been added to enable setting the default number of divisions; if set to `auto`, the number of divisions will be chosen by the distance between major ticks.

### Axline setters and getters

The returned object from <span class="title-ref">.axes.Axes.axline</span> now supports getter and setter methods for its *xy1*, *xy2* and *slope* attributes:

`` `python     line1.get_xy1()     line1.get_slope()     line2.get_xy2()  .. code-block:: python      line1.set_xy1(.2, .3)     line1.set_slope(2.4)     line2.set_xy2(.1, .6)  Clipping for contour plots ``\` --------------------------

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.contour</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.contourf</span> now accept the *clip\_path* parameter.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.patches as mpatches

x = y = np.arange(-3.0, 3.01, 0.025) X, Y = np.meshgrid(x, y) Z1 = np.exp(-X\**2 - Y2) Z2 = np.exp(-(X - 1)2 - (Y - 1)2) Z = (Z1 - Z2)* 2

fig, ax = plt.subplots() patch = mpatches.RegularPolygon((0, 0), 5, radius=2, transform=ax.transData) ax.contourf(X, Y, Z, clip\_path=patch)

plt.show()

</div>

### `Axes.ecdf`

A new Axes method, <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.ecdf</span>, allows plotting empirical cumulative distribution functions without any binning.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.ecdf(np.random.randn(100))

</div>

### `Figure.get_suptitle()`, `Figure.get_supxlabel()`, `Figure.get_supylabel()`

These methods return the strings set by `Figure.suptitle()`, `Figure.supxlabel()` and `Figure.supylabel()` respectively.

### `Ellipse.get_vertices()`, `Ellipse.get_co_vertices()`

These methods return the coordinates of ellipse vertices of major and minor axis. Additionally, an example gallery demo is added which shows how to add an arrow to an ellipse showing a clockwise or counter-clockwise rotation of the ellipse. To place the arrow exactly on the ellipse, the coordinates of the vertices are used.

### Remove inner ticks in `label_outer()`

Up to now, `label_outer()` has only removed the ticklabels. The ticks lines were left visible. This is now configurable through a new parameter `label_outer(remove_inner_ticks=True)`.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = np.linspace(0, 2 \* np.pi, 100)

  - fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 2, sharex=True, sharey=True,  
    gridspec\_kw=dict(hspace=0, wspace=0))

axs\[0, 0\].plot(x, np.sin(x)) axs\[0, 1\].plot(x, np.cos(x)) axs\[1, 0\].plot(x, -np.cos(x)) axs\[1, 1\].plot(x, -np.sin(x))

  - for ax in axs.flat:  
    ax.grid(color='0.9') ax.label\_outer(remove\_inner\_ticks=True)

</div>

### Configurable legend shadows

The *shadow* parameter of legends now accepts dicts in addition to booleans. Dictionaries can contain any keywords for <span class="title-ref">.patches.Patch</span>. For example, this allows one to set the color and/or the transparency of a legend shadow:

`` `python    ax.legend(loc='center left', shadow={'color': 'red', 'alpha': 0.5})  and to control the shadow location:  .. code-block:: python     ax.legend(loc='center left', shadow={"ox":20, "oy":-20})  Configuration is currently not supported via :rc:`legend.shadow`. ``offset`parameter for MultipleLocator`\` ----------------------------------------

An *offset* may now be specified to shift all the ticks by the given value.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt import matplotlib.ticker as mticker

\_, ax = plt.subplots() ax.plot(range(10)) locator = mticker.MultipleLocator(base=3, offset=0.3) ax.xaxis.set\_major\_locator(locator)

plt.show()

</div>

### Add a new valid color format `(matplotlib_color, alpha)`

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt from matplotlib.patches import Rectangle

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

  - rectangle = Rectangle((.2, .2), .6, .6,  
    facecolor=('blue', 0.2), edgecolor=('green', 0.5))

ax.add\_patch(rectangle)

</div>

Users can define a color using the new color specification, *(matplotlib\_color, alpha)*. Note that an explicit alpha keyword argument will override an alpha value from *(matplotlib\_color, alpha)*.

### The pie chart shadow can be controlled

The *shadow* argument to <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pie</span> can now be a dict, allowing more control of the <span class="title-ref">.Shadow</span>-patch used.

### `PolyQuadMesh` is a new class for drawing quadrilateral meshes

<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolor</span> previously returned a flattened <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span> with only the valid polygons (unmasked) contained within it. Now, we return a <span class="title-ref">.PolyQuadMesh</span>, which is a mixin incorporating the usefulness of 2D array and mesh coordinates handling, but still inheriting the draw methods of <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span>, which enables more control over the rendering properties than a normal <span class="title-ref">.QuadMesh</span> that is returned from <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.pcolormesh</span>. The new class subclasses <span class="title-ref">.PolyCollection</span> and thus should still behave the same as before. This new class keeps track of the mask for the user and updates the Polygons that are sent to the renderer appropriately.

<div class="plot">

arr = np.arange(12).reshape((3, 4))

fig, ax = plt.subplots() pc = ax.pcolor(arr)

\# Mask one element and show that the hatch is also not drawn \# over that region pc.set\_array(np.ma.masked\_equal(arr, 5)) pc.set\_hatch('//')

plt.show()

</div>

### Shadow shade can be controlled

The <span class="title-ref">.Shadow</span> patch now has a *shade* argument to control the shadow darkness. If 1, the shadow is black, if 0, the shadow has the same color as the patch that is shadowed. The default value, which earlier was fixed, is 0.7.

### `SpinesProxy` now supports calling the `set()` method

One can now call e.g. `ax.spines[:].set(visible=False)`.

### Allow setting the tick label fonts with a keyword argument

`Axes.tick_params` now accepts a *labelfontfamily* keyword that changes the tick label font separately from the rest of the text objects:

`` `python     Axis.tick_params(labelfontfamily='monospace')   Figure, Axes, and Legend Layout ``\` ===============================

### pad\_inches="layout" for savefig

When using constrained or compressed layout,

`` `python     savefig(filename, bbox_inches="tight", pad_inches="layout")  will now use the padding sizes defined on the layout engine.  Add a public method to modify the location of ``Legend`  `\` --------------------------------------------------------

<span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.legend.Legend</span> locations now can be tweaked after they've been defined.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true">

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add\_subplot(1, 1, 1)

x = list(range(-100, 101)) y = \[i\*\*2 for i in x\]

ax.plot(x, y, label="f(x)") ax.legend() ax.get\_legend().set\_loc("right") \# Or \# ax.get\_legend().set(loc="right")

plt.show()

</div>

### `rcParams['legend.loc']` now accepts float-tuple inputs

The `legend.loc` rcParams now accepts float-tuple inputs, same as the *loc* keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">.Legend</span>. This allows users to set the location of the legend in a more flexible and consistent way.

## Mathtext improvements

Improvements are to Mathtext, Matplotlib's native TeX-like mathematics parser (see \[mathtext\](\#mathtext), not to be confused with Matplotlib using LaTeX directly: \[usetex\](\#usetex)).

### Boldsymbol mathtext command `\boldsymbol`

Supports using the `\boldsymbol{}` command in mathtext:

To change symbols to bold enclose the text in a font command as shown:

`` `none     r'$\boldsymbol{a+2+\alpha}$'  .. math::    \boldsymbol{a+2+\alpha} ``mathtext`has more sizable delimiters`\` ----------------------------------------

The `\lgroup` and `\rgroup` sizable delimiters have been added.

The following delimiter names have been supported earlier, but can now be sized with `\left` and `\right`:

  - `\lbrace`, `\rbrace`, `\leftbrace`, and `\rightbrace`
  - `\lbrack` and `\rbrack`
  - `\leftparen` and `\rightparen`

There are really no obvious advantages in using these. Instead, they are are added for completeness.

### `mathtext` documentation improvements

The documentation is updated to take information directly from the parser. This means that (almost) all supported symbols, operators etc are shown at \[mathtext\](\#mathtext).

### `mathtext` now supports `\substack`

`\substack` can be used to create multi-line subscripts or superscripts within an equation.

To use it to enclose the math in a substack command as shown:

`` `none     r'$\sum_{\substack{1\leq i\leq 3\\ 1\leq j\leq 5}}$'  .. mathmpl::      \sum_{\substack{1\leq i\leq 3\\ 1\leq j\leq 5}} ``mathtext`now supports`middle`delimiter`\` -----------------------------------------------

The `\middle` delimiter has been added, and can now be used with the `\left` and `\right` delimiters:

To use the middle command enclose it in between the `\left` and `\right` delimiter command as shown:

`` `none     r'$\left( \frac{a}{b} \middle| q \right)$'  .. mathmpl::      \left( \frac{a}{b} \middle| q \right) ``mathtext`operators`\` ----------------------

There has been a number of operators added and corrected when a Unicode font is used. In addition, correct spacing has been added to a number of the previous operators. Especially, the characters used for `\gnapprox`, `\lnapprox`, `\leftangle`, and `\rightangle` have been corrected.

### `mathtext` spacing corrections

As consequence of the updated documentation, the spacing on a number of relational and operator symbols were classified like that and therefore will be spaced properly.

### `mathtext` now supports `\text`

`\text` can be used to obtain upright text within an equation and to get a plain dash (-).

<div class="plot" data-include-source="true" alt="Illustration of the newly added \text command, showing that it renders as normal text, including spaces, despite being part of an equation. Also show that a dash is not rendered as a minus when part of a \text command.">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt plt.text(0.1, 0.5, r"$a = sin(phi) text{ such that } phi = frac{x}{y}$") plt.text(0.1, 0.3, r"$text{dashes (-) are retained}$")

</div>

### Bold-italic mathtext command `\mathbfit`

Supports use of bold-italic font style in mathtext using the `\mathbfit{}` command:

To change font to bold and italic enclose the text in a font command as shown:

`` `none     r'$\mathbfit{\eta \leq C(\delta(\eta))}$  .. math::    \mathbfit{\eta \leq C(\delta(\eta))}   3D plotting improvements ``\` ========================

### Specify ticks and axis label positions for 3D plots

You can now specify the positions of ticks and axis labels for 3D plots.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

positions = \['lower', 'upper', 'default', 'both', 'none'\] fig, axs = plt.subplots(2, 3, figsize=(12, 8), subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'}) for ax, pos in zip(axs.flatten(), positions): for axis in ax.xaxis, ax.yaxis, ax.zaxis: axis.set\_label\_position(pos) axis.set\_ticks\_position(pos) title = f'position="{pos}"' ax.set(xlabel='x', ylabel='y', zlabel='z', title=title) axs\[1, 2\].axis('off')

</div>

### 3D hover coordinates

The x, y, z coordinates displayed in 3D plots were previously showing nonsensical values. This has been fixed to report the coordinate on the view pane directly beneath the mouse cursor. This is likely to be most useful when viewing 3D plots along a primary axis direction when using an orthographic projection, or when a 2D plot has been projected onto one of the 3D axis panes. Note that there is still no way to directly display the coordinates of plotted data points.

### 3D plots can share view angles

3D plots can now share the same view angles, so that when you rotate one plot the other plots also rotate. This can be done with the *shareview* keyword argument when adding an axes, or by using the *ax1.shareview(ax2)* method of existing 3D axes.

## Other improvements

### macosx: New figures can be opened in either windows or tabs

There is a new `macosx.window_mode` rcParam to control how new figures are opened with the macosx backend. The default is **system** which uses the system settings, or one can specify either **tab** or **window** to explicitly choose the mode used to open new figures.

### `matplotlib.mpl_toolkits` is now an implicit namespace package

Following the deprecation of `pkg_resources.declare_namespace` in `setuptools` 67.3.0, `matplotlib.mpl_toolkits` is now implemented as an implicit namespace, following [PEP 420](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/).

### Plot Directive now can make responsive images with "srcset"

The plot sphinx directive (`matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive`, invoked in rst as `.. plot::`) can be configured to automatically make higher res figures and add these to the the built html docs. In `conf.py`:

    extensions = [
    ...
        'matplotlib.sphinxext.plot_directive',
        'matplotlib.sphinxext.figmpl_directive',
    ...]
    
    plot_srcset = ['2x']

will make png files with double the resolution for hiDPI displays. Resulting html files will have image entries like:

    <img src="../_images/nestedpage-index-2.png" style="" srcset="../_images/nestedpage-index-2.png, ../_images/nestedpage-index-2.2x.png 2.00x" alt="" class="plot-directive "/>

## Plotting and Annotation improvements

### `Axes.inset_axes` is no longer experimental

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.inset\_axes</span> is considered stable for use.

### Legend support for Boxplot

Boxplots now support a *label* parameter to create legend entries. Legend labels can be passed as a list of strings to label multiple boxes in a single <span class="title-ref">.Axes.boxplot</span> call:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Example of creating 3 boxplots and assigning legend labels as a sequence.">

np.random.seed(19680801) fruit\_weights = \[ np.random.normal(130, 10, size=100), np.random.normal(125, 20, size=100), np.random.normal(120, 30, size=100), \] labels = \['peaches', 'oranges', 'tomatoes'\] colors = \['peachpuff', 'orange', 'tomato'\]

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.set\_ylabel('fruit weight (g)')

  - bplot = ax.boxplot(fruit\_weights,  
    patch\_artist=True, \# fill with color label=labels)

\# fill with colors for patch, color in zip(bplot\['boxes'\], colors): patch.set\_facecolor(color)

ax.set\_xticks(\[\]) ax.legend()

</div>

Or as a single string to each individual \`.Axes.boxplot\`:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Example of creating 2 boxplots and assigning each legend label as a string.">

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

data\_A = np.random.random((100, 3)) data\_B = np.random.random((100, 3)) + 0.2 pos = np.arange(3)

  - ax.boxplot(data\_A, positions=pos - 0.2, patch\_artist=True, label='Box A',  
    boxprops={'facecolor': 'steelblue'})

  - ax.boxplot(data\_B, positions=pos + 0.2, patch\_artist=True, label='Box B',  
    boxprops={'facecolor': 'lightblue'})

ax.legend()

</div>

### Percent sign in pie labels auto-escaped with `usetex=True`

It is common, with <span class="title-ref">.Axes.pie</span>, to specify labels that include a percent sign (`%`), which denotes a comment for LaTeX. When enabling LaTeX with `text.usetex` or passing `textprops={"usetex": True}`, this used to cause the percent sign to disappear.

Now, the percent sign is automatically escaped (by adding a preceding backslash) so that it appears regardless of the `usetex` setting. If you have pre-escaped the percent sign, this will be detected, and remain as is.

### `hatch` parameter for stackplot

The <span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.stackplot</span> *hatch* parameter now accepts a list of strings describing hatching styles that will be applied sequentially to the layers in the stack:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Two charts, identified as ax1 and ax2, showing &quot;stackplots&quot;, i.e. one-dimensional distributions of data stacked on top of one another. The first plot, ax1 has cross-hatching on all slices, having been given a single string as the &quot;hatch&quot; argument. The second plot, ax2 has different styles of hatching on each slice - diagonal hatching in opposite directions on the first two slices, cross-hatching on the third slice, and open circles on the fourth.">

fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(ncols=2, figsize=(10,5))

cols = 10 rows = 4 data = ( np.reshape(np.arange(0, cols, 1), (1, -1)) \*\* 2 + np.reshape(np.arange(0, rows), (-1, 1)) + np.random.random((rows, cols))\*5 ) x = range(data.shape\[1\]) ax1.stackplot(x, data, hatch="x") ax2.stackplot(x, data, hatch=\["//","\\","x","o"\])

ax1.set\_title("hatch='x'") ax2.set\_title("hatch=\['//','\\\\','x','o'\]")

plt.show()

</div>

### Add option to plot only one half of violin plot

Setting the parameter *side* to 'low' or 'high' allows to only plot one half of the <span class="title-ref">.Axes.violinplot</span>.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Three copies of a vertical violin plot; first in blue showing the default of both sides, followed by an orange copy that only shows the &quot;low&quot; (or left, in this case) side, and finally a green copy that only shows the &quot;high&quot; (or right) side.">

\# Fake data with reproducible random state. np.random.seed(19680801) data = np.random.normal(0, 8, size=100)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

ax.violinplot(data, \[0\], showmeans=True, showextrema=True) ax.violinplot(data, \[1\], showmeans=True, showextrema=True, side='low') ax.violinplot(data, \[2\], showmeans=True, showextrema=True, side='high')

ax.set\_title('Violin Sides Example') ax.set\_xticks(\[0, 1, 2\], \['Default', 'side="low"', 'side="high"'\]) ax.set\_yticklabels(\[\])

</div>

### `axhline` and `axhspan` on polar axes

... now draw circles and circular arcs (<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axhline</span>) or annuli and wedges (<span class="title-ref">\~.Axes.axhspan</span>).

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="A sample polar plot, that contains an axhline at radius 1, an axhspan annulus between radius 0.8 and 0.9, and an axhspan wedge between radius 0.6 and 0.7 and 288° and 324°.">

fig = plt.figure() ax = fig.add\_subplot(projection="polar") ax.set\_rlim(0, 1.2)

ax.axhline(1, c="C0", alpha=.5) ax.axhspan(.8, .9, fc="C1", alpha=.5) ax.axhspan(.6, .7, .8, .9, fc="C2", alpha=.5)

</div>

### Subplot titles can now be automatically aligned

Subplot axes titles can be misaligned vertically if tick labels or xlabels are placed at the top of one subplot. The new <span class="title-ref">\~.Figure.align\_titles</span> method on the <span class="title-ref">.Figure</span> class will now align the titles vertically.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="A figure with two Axes side-by-side, the second of which with ticks on top. The Axes titles and x-labels appear unaligned with each other due to these ticks.">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, layout='constrained')

axs\[0\].plot(np.arange(0, 1e6, 1000)) axs\[0\].set\_title('Title 0') axs\[0\].set\_xlabel('XLabel 0')

axs\[1\].plot(np.arange(1, 0, -0.1) \* 2000, np.arange(1, 0, -0.1)) axs\[1\].set\_title('Title 1') axs\[1\].set\_xlabel('XLabel 1') axs\[1\].xaxis.tick\_top() axs\[1\].tick\_params(axis='x', rotation=55)

</div>

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="A figure with two Axes side-by-side, the second of which with ticks on top. Unlike the previous figure, the Axes titles and x-labels appear aligned.">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, layout='constrained')

axs\[0\].plot(np.arange(0, 1e6, 1000)) axs\[0\].set\_title('Title 0') axs\[0\].set\_xlabel('XLabel 0')

axs\[1\].plot(np.arange(1, 0, -0.1) \* 2000, np.arange(1, 0, -0.1)) axs\[1\].set\_title('Title 1') axs\[1\].set\_xlabel('XLabel 1') axs\[1\].xaxis.tick\_top() axs\[1\].tick\_params(axis='x', rotation=55)

fig.align\_labels() fig.align\_titles()

</div>

### `axisartist` can now be used together with standard `Formatters`

... instead of being limited to axisartist-specific ones.

### Toggle minorticks on Axis

Minor ticks on an <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axis.Axis</span> can be displayed or removed using <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axis.Axis.minorticks\_on</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axis.Axis.minorticks\_off</span>; e.g., `ax.xaxis.minorticks_on()`. See also <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.axes.Axes.minorticks\_on</span>.

### `StrMethodFormatter` now respects `axes.unicode_minus`

When formatting negative values, <span class="title-ref">.StrMethodFormatter</span> will now use unicode minus signs if `axes.unicode_minus` is set.

> \>\>\> from matplotlib.ticker import StrMethodFormatter \>\>\> with plt.rc\_context({'axes.unicode\_minus': False}): ... formatter = StrMethodFormatter('{x}') ... print(formatter.format\_data(-10)) -10
> 
> \>\>\> with plt.rc\_context({'axes.unicode\_minus': True}): ... formatter = StrMethodFormatter('{x}') ... print(formatter.format\_data(-10)) −10

## Figure, Axes, and Legend Layout

### Subfigures now have controllable zorders

Previously, setting the zorder of a subfigure had no effect, and those were plotted on top of any figure-level artists (i.e for example on top of fig-level legends). Now, subfigures behave like any other artists, and their zorder can be controlled, with default a zorder of 0.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Example on controlling the zorder of a subfigure">

x = np.linspace(1, 10, 10) y1, y2 = x, -x fig = plt.figure(constrained\_layout=True) subfigs = fig.subfigures(nrows=1, ncols=2) for subfig in subfigs: axarr = subfig.subplots(2, 1) for ax in axarr.flatten(): (l1,) = ax.plot(x, y1, label="line1") (l2,) = ax.plot(x, y2, label="line2") subfigs\[0\].set\_zorder(6) l = fig.legend(handles=\[l1, l2\], loc="upper center", ncol=2)

</div>

### Getters for xmargin, ymargin and zmargin

<span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_xmargin</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.get\_ymargin</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.get\_zmargin</span> methods have been added to return the margin values set by <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_xmargin</span>, <span class="title-ref">.Axes.set\_ymargin</span> and <span class="title-ref">.Axes3D.set\_zmargin</span>, respectively.

## Mathtext improvements

### `mathtext` documentation improvements

The documentation is updated to take information directly from the parser. This means that (almost) all supported symbols, operators, etc. are shown at \[mathtext\](\#mathtext).

### `mathtext` spacing corrections

As consequence of the updated documentation, the spacing on a number of relational and operator symbols were correctly classified and therefore will be spaced properly.

## Widget Improvements

### Check and Radio Button widgets support clearing

The <span class="title-ref">.CheckButtons</span> and <span class="title-ref">.RadioButtons</span> widgets now support clearing their state by calling their `.clear` method. Note that it is not possible to have no selected radio buttons, so the selected option at construction time is selected.

## 3D plotting improvements

### Setting 3D axis limits now set the limits exactly

Previously, setting the limits of a 3D axis would always add a small margin to the limits. Limits are now set exactly by default. The newly introduced rcparam `axes3d.automargin` can be used to revert to the old behavior where margin is automatically added.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Example of the new behavior of 3D axis limits, and how setting the rcParam reverts to the old behavior.">

fig, axs = plt.subplots(1, 2, subplot\_kw={'projection': '3d'})

plt.rcParams\['axes3d.automargin'\] = True axs\[0\].set(xlim=(0, 1), ylim=(0, 1), zlim=(0, 1), title='Old Behavior')

plt.rcParams\['axes3d.automargin'\] = False \# the default in 3.9.0 axs\[1\].set(xlim=(0, 1), ylim=(0, 1), zlim=(0, 1), title='New Behavior')

</div>

## Other improvements

### BackendRegistry

New <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.backends.registry.BackendRegistry</span> class is the single source of truth for available backends. The singleton instance is `matplotlib.backends.backend_registry`. It is used internally by Matplotlib, and also IPython (and therefore Jupyter) starting with IPython 8.24.0.

There are three sources of backends: built-in (source code is within the Matplotlib repository), explicit `module://some.backend` syntax (backend is obtained by loading the module), or via an entry point (self-registering backend in an external package).

To obtain a list of all registered backends use:

> \>\>\> from matplotlib.backends import backend\_registry \>\>\> backend\_registry.list\_all()

### Add `widths`, `heights` and `angles` setter to `EllipseCollection`

The `widths`, `heights` and `angles` values of the <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.collections.EllipseCollection</span> can now be changed after the collection has been created.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

from matplotlib.collections import EllipseCollection

rng = np.random.default\_rng(0)

widths = (2, ) heights = (3, ) angles = (45, ) offsets = rng.random((10, 2)) \* 10

fig, ax = plt.subplots()

  - ec = EllipseCollection(  
    widths=widths, heights=heights, angles=angles, offsets=offsets, units='x', offset\_transform=ax.transData, )

ax.add\_collection(ec) ax.set\_xlim(-2, 12) ax.set\_ylim(-2, 12)

new\_widths = rng.random((10, 2)) \* 2 new\_heights = rng.random((10, 2)) \* 3 new\_angles = rng.random((10, 2)) \* 180

ec.set(widths=new\_widths, heights=new\_heights, angles=new\_angles)

</div>

### `image.interpolation_stage` rcParam

This new rcParam controls whether image interpolation occurs in "data" space or in "rgba" space.

### Arrow patch position is now modifiable

A setter method has been added that allows updating the position of the <span class="title-ref">.patches.Arrow</span> object without requiring a full re-draw.

<div class="plot" data-include-source="" alt="Example of changing the position of the arrow with the new ``set_data`` method.">

from matplotlib import animation from matplotlib.patches import Arrow

fig, ax = plt.subplots() ax.set\_xlim(0, 10) ax.set\_ylim(0, 10)

a = Arrow(2, 0, 0, 10) ax.add\_patch(a)

\# code for modifying the arrow def update(i): a.set\_data(x=.5, dx=i, dy=6, width=2)

ani = animation.FuncAnimation(fig, update, frames=15, interval=90, blit=False)

plt.show()

</div>

### NonUniformImage now has mouseover support

When mousing over a <span class="title-ref">\~matplotlib.image.NonUniformImage</span>, the data values are now displayed.

# Some plots

Plot 1 does not use context:

<div class="plot">

plt.plot(range(10)) a = 10

</div>

Plot 2 doesn't use context either; has length 6:

<div class="plot">

plt.plot(range(6))

</div>

Plot 3 has length 4, and uses doctest syntax:

<div class="plot" data-format="doctest">

This is a doctest...

\>\>\> plt.plot(range(4))

... isn't it?

</div>

Plot 4 shows that a new block with context does not see the variable defined in the no-context block:

<div class="plot" data-context="">

assert 'a' not in globals()

</div>

Plot 5 defines `a` in a context block:

<div class="plot" data-context="">

plt.plot(range(6)) a = 10

</div>

Plot 6 shows that a block with context sees the new variable. It also uses `:nofigs:`:

<div class="plot" data-context="" data-nofigs="">

assert a == 10 b = 4

</div>

Plot 7 uses a variable previously defined in previous `nofigs` context. It also closes any previous figures to create a fresh figure:

<div class="plot" data-context="close-figs">

assert b == 4 plt.plot(range(b))

</div>

Plot 8 shows that a non-context block still doesn't have `a`:

<div class="plot" data-nofigs="">

assert 'a' not in globals()

</div>

Plot 9 has a context block, and does have `a`:

<div class="plot" data-context="" data-nofigs="">

assert a == 10

</div>

Plot 10 resets context, and `a` has gone again:

<div class="plot" data-context="reset" data-nofigs="">

assert 'a' not in globals() c = 10

</div>

Plot 11 continues the context, we have the new value, but not the old:

<div class="plot" data-context="">

assert c == 10 assert 'a' not in globals() plt.plot(range(c))

</div>

Plot 12 opens a new figure. By default the directive will plot both the first and the second figure:

<div class="plot" data-context="">

plt.figure() plt.plot(range(6))

</div>

Plot 13 shows `close-figs` in action. `close-figs` closes all figures previous to this plot directive, so we get always plot the figure we create in the directive:

<div class="plot" data-context="close-figs">

plt.figure() plt.plot(range(4))

</div>

Plot 14 uses `include-source`:

<div class="plot" data-include-source="">

\# Only a comment

</div>

Plot 15 uses an external file with the plot commands and a caption:

<div class="plot">

range4.py

This is the caption for plot 15.

</div>

Plot 16 uses a specific function in a file with plot commands:

<div class="plot">

range6.py range6

</div>

Plot 17 gets a caption specified by the :caption: option:

<div class="plot" data-caption="Plot 17 uses the caption option.">

plt.figure() plt.plot(range(6))

</div>

Plot 18 uses an external file with the plot commands and a caption using the :caption: option:

<div class="plot" data-caption="This is the caption for plot 18.">

range4.py

</div>

Plot 19 uses shows that the "plot-directive" class is still appended, even if we request other custom classes:

<div class="plot my-class my-other-class">

range4.py

Should also have a caption.

</div>

Plot 20 shows that the default template correctly prints the multi-image scenario:

<div class="plot" data-caption="This caption applies to both plots.">

plt.figure() plt.plot(range(6))

plt.figure() plt.plot(range(4))

</div>

Plot 21 is generated via an include directive:

Plot 21 has length 6

<div class="plot">

plt.plot(range(6))

</div>

Plot 22 uses a different specific function in a file with plot commands:

<div class="plot">

range6.py range10

</div>
