# Coverage.py API

There are a few different ways to use coverage.py programmatically.

The API to coverage.py is in a module called `coverage`. Most of the interface is in the <span class="title-ref">coverage.Coverage</span> class. Methods on the Coverage object correspond roughly to operations available in the command line interface. For example, a simple use would be:

    import coverage
    
    cov = coverage.Coverage()
    cov.start()
    
    # .. call your code ..
    
    cov.stop()
    cov.save()
    
    cov.html_report()

Any of the methods can raise specialized exceptions described in \[api\_exceptions\](\#api\_exceptions).

Coverage.py supports plugins that can change its behavior, to collect information from non-Python files, or to perform complex configuration. See \[api\_plugin\](\#api\_plugin) for details.

If you want to access the data that coverage.py has collected, the <span class="title-ref">coverage.CoverageData</span> class provides an API to read coverage.py data files.

\> **Note** \> Only the documented portions of the API are supported. Other names you may find in modules or objects can change their behavior at any time. Please limit yourself to documented methods to avoid problems.

For more intensive data use, you might want to access the coverage.py database file directly. The schema is subject to change, so this is for advanced uses only. \[dbschema\](\#dbschema) explains more.

The most important thing in the coverage module is the <span class="title-ref">coverage.Coverage</span> class, described in \[api\_coverage\](\#api\_coverage), but there are a few other things also.

<div class="data">

version\_info

</div>

A tuple of five elements, similar to \`sys.version\_info \<python:sys.version\_info\><span class="title-ref">: \*major\*, \*minor\*, \*micro\*, \*releaselevel\*, and \*serial\*. All values except \*releaselevel\* are integers; the release level is </span><span class="title-ref">'alpha'</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">'beta'</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">'candidate'</span><span class="title-ref">, or </span><span class="title-ref">'final'</span><span class="title-ref">. Unlike \`sys.version\_info \<python:sys.version\_info\></span>, the elements are not available by name.

<div class="data">

\_\_version\_\_

</div>

A string with the version of coverage.py, for example, `"5.0b2"`.

# Branch coverage measurement

In addition to the usual statement coverage, coverage.py also supports branch coverage measurement. Where a line in your program could jump to more than one next line, coverage.py tracks which of those destinations are actually visited, and flags lines that haven't visited all of their possible destinations.

For example:

``` python
def my_partial_fn(x):
    if x:
        y = 10
    return y

my_partial_fn(1)
```

In this code, line 2 is an `if` statement which can go next to either line 3 or line 4. Statement coverage would show all lines of the function as executed. But the if was never evaluated as false, so line 2 never jumps to line 4.

Branch coverage will flag this code as not fully covered because of the missing jump from line 2 to line 4. This is known as a partial branch.

## How to measure branch coverage

To measure branch coverage, run coverage.py with the `--branch` flag:

``` python
coverage run --branch myprog.py
```

When you report on the results with `coverage report` or `coverage html`, the percentage of branch possibilities taken will be included in the percentage covered total for each file. The coverage percentage for a file is the actual executions divided by the execution opportunities. Each line in the file is an execution opportunity, as is each branch destination.

The HTML report gives information about which lines had missing branches. Lines that were missing some branches are shown in yellow, with an annotation at the far right showing branch destination line numbers that were not exercised.

The XML and JSON reports produced by `coverage xml` and `coverage json` also include branch information, including separate statement and branch coverage percentages.

## How it works

When measuring branches, coverage.py collects pairs of line numbers, a source and destination for each transition from one line to another. Static analysis of the source provides a list of possible transitions. Comparing the measured to the possible indicates missing branches.

The idea of tracking how lines follow each other was from [Titus Brown](http://ivory.idyll.org/blog). Thanks, Titus\!

## Excluding code

If you have \[excluded code \<excluding\>\](\#excluded-code-\<excluding\>), a conditional will not be counted as a branch if one of its choices is excluded:

``` python
def only_one_choice(x):
    if x:
        blah1()
        blah2()
    else:  # pragma: no cover
        # x is always true.
        blah3()
```

Because the `else` clause is excluded, the `if` only has one possible next line, so it isn't considered a branch at all.

## Structurally partial branches

Sometimes branching constructs are used in unusual ways that don't actually branch. For example:

``` python
while True:
    if cond:
        break
    do_something()
```

Here the while loop will never exit normally, so it doesn't take both of its "possible" branches. For some of these constructs, such as "while True:" and "if 0:", coverage.py understands what is going on. In these cases, the line will not be marked as a partial branch.

But there are many ways in your own code to write intentionally partial branches, and you don't want coverage.py pestering you about them. You can tell coverage.py that you don't want them flagged by marking them with a pragma:

``` python
i = 0
while i < 999999999:  # pragma: no branch
    if eventually():
        break
```

Here the while loop will never complete because the break will always be taken at some point. Coverage.py can't work that out on its own, but the "no branch" pragma indicates that the branch is known to be partial, and the line is not flagged.

### Generator expressions

Generator expressions may also report partial branch coverage. Consider the following example:

``` python
value = next(i in range(1))
```

While we might expect this line of code to be reported as covered, the generator did not iterate until `StopIteration` is raised, the indication that the loop is complete. This is another case where adding `# pragma: no branch` may be desirable.

## Unreleased

Nothing yet.

## Version 7.6.7 — 2024-11-15

  - fix: ugh, the other assert from 7.6.5 can also be encountered in the wild, so it's been restored to a conditional. Sorry for the churn.

## Version 7.6.6 — 2024-11-15

  - One of the new asserts from 7.6.5 caused problems in real projects, as reported in [issue 1891](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1891). The assert has been removed.

## Version 7.6.5 — 2024-11-14

  - fix: fine-tuned the exact Python version (3.12.6) when exiting from `with` statements changed how they traced. This affected whether people saw the fix for [issue 1880](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1880).
  - fix: isolate our code more from mocking in the os module that in rare cases can cause [bizarre behavior](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/666).
  - refactor: some code unreachable code paths in parser.py were changed to asserts. If you encounter any of these, please let me know\!

## Version 7.6.4 — 2024-10-20

  - fix: multi-line `with` statements could cause contained branches to be incorrectly marked as missing ([issue 1880](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1880)). This is now fixed.

## Version 7.6.3 — 2024-10-13

  - Fix: nested context managers could incorrectly be analyzed to flag a missing branch on the last context manager, as described in [issue 1876](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1876). This is now fixed.
  - Fix: the missing branch message about not exiting a module had an extra "didn't," as described in [issue 1873](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1873). This is now fixed.

## Version 7.6.2 — 2024-10-09

  - Dropped support for Python 3.8 and PyPy 3.8.
  - Fix: a final wildcard match/case clause assigning to a name (`case _ as value`) was incorrectly marked as a missing branch. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1860](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1860).
  - Fewer things are considered branches now. Lambdas, comprehensions, and generator expressions are no longer marked as missing branches if they don't complete execution. Closes [issue 1852](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1852).
  - Fix: the HTML report didn't properly show multi-line f-strings that end with a backslash continuation. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1836](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1836), thanks to [LiuYinCarl and Marco Ricci](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1838).
  - Fix: the LCOV report now has correct line numbers (fixing [issue 1846](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1846)) and better branch descriptions for BRDA records (fixing [issue 1850](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1850)). There are other changes to lcov also, including a new configuration option \[line\_checksums \<config\_lcov\_line\_checksums\>\](\#line\_checksums-\<config\_lcov\_line\_checksums\>) to control whether line checksums are included in the lcov report. The default is false. To keep checksums set it to true. All this work is thanks to Zack Weinberg ([pull 1849](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1849) and [pull 1851](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1851)).
  - Fixed the docs for multi-line regex exclusions, closing [issue 1863](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1863).
  - Fixed a potential crash in the C tracer, closing [issue 1835](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1835), thanks to [Jan Kühle](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1843).

## Version 7.6.1 — 2024-08-04

  - Fix: coverage used to fail when measuring code using <span class="title-ref">runpy.run\_path \<python:runpy.run\_path\></span> with a <span class="title-ref">Path \<python:pathlib.Path\></span> argument. This is now fixed, thanks to [Ask Hjorth Larsen](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1819).
  - Fix: backslashes preceding a multi-line backslashed string could confuse the HTML report. This is now fixed, thanks to [LiuYinCarl](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1828).
  - Now we publish wheels for Python 3.13, both regular and free-threaded.

## Version 7.6.0 — 2024-07-11

  - Exclusion patterns can now be multi-line, thanks to [Daniel Diniz \<pull 1807\_\>](). This enables many interesting exclusion use-cases, including those requested in issues [118](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/118) (entire files), [996](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/996) (multiple lines only when appearing together), [1741](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1741) (remainder of a function), and [1803](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1803) (arbitrary sequence of marked lines). See the \[multi\_line\_exclude\](\#multi\_line\_exclude) section of the docs for more details and examples.
  - The JSON report now includes per-function and per-class coverage information. Thanks to [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1809) for getting the work started. This closes [issue 1793](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1793) and [issue 1532](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1532).
  - Fixed an incorrect calculation of "(no class)" lines in the HTML classes report.
  - Python 3.13.0b3 is supported.

## Version 7.5.4 — 2024-06-22

  - If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch coverage data, coverage.py used to fail with the message "Can't combine arc data with line data" or its reverse, "Can't combine line data with arc data." These messages used internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand the problem. They are now changed to mention "branch coverage data" and "statement coverage data."
  - Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard match/case cases using names or guard clauses.
  - Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python. I'm not claiming full support yet. Closes [issue 1799](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1799).

## Version 7.5.3 — 2024-05-28

  - Performance improvements for combining data files, especially when measuring line coverage. A few different quadratic behaviors were eliminated. In one extreme case of combining 700+ data files, the time dropped from more than three hours to seven minutes. Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the fix.
  - Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a side benefit of reducing memory use, closing [issue 1791](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1791). Thanks to Daniel Diniz for helping to diagnose the problem.

## Version 7.5.2 — 2024-05-24

  - Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as reported in [issue 1779](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1779). This is now fixed.
  - Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an executable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not executable if it was the first line. Now module docstrings are never counted as executable statements. This can change coverage.py's count of the number of statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage reported.
  - In the HTML report, the filter term and "hide covered" checkbox settings are remembered between viewings, thanks to [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1776).
  - Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.
  - Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to [Liam DeVoe](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1788). Closes [issue 1787](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1787).

## Version 7.5.1 — 2024-05-04

  - Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is on the first line. This closes [issue 754](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/754). The fix was contributed by [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1773).
  - Fix: very complex source files like [this one](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/130950f3e6b3f97fcc17f4599ac08f70fdd2e9d4/sympy/polys/numberfields/resolvent_lookup.py) could cause a maximum recursion error when creating an HTML report. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1774](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1774).
  - HTML report improvements:
      - Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of stale cached copies.
      - Missing branch coverage explanations that said "the condition was never false" now read "the condition was always true" because it's easier to understand.
      - Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index pages, fixing [issue 1766](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1766). Thanks, [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1768).

## Version 7.5.0 — 2024-04-23

  - Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report. There are now three index pages which link to each other: files, functions, and classes. Other reports don't yet have this information, but it will be added in the future where it makes sense. Feedback gladly accepted\! Finishes [issue 780](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/780).
  - Other HTML report improvements:
      - There is now a "hide covered" checkbox to filter out 100% files, finishing [issue 1384](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1384).
      - The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer indications of the sorting.
      - The "previous file" shortcut key didn't work on the index page, but now it does, fixing [issue 1765](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1765).
  - The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren't taking effect, and is renamed from "attempted\_config\_files" to the more logical "config\_files\_attempted."
  - Python 3.13.0a6 is supported.

## Version 7.4.4 — 2024-03-14

  - Fix: in some cases, even with `[run] relative_files=True`, a data file could be created with absolute path names. When combined with other relative data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made relative or not. If they weren't, then a file would be listed twice in reports, as detailed in [issue 1752](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752). This is now fixed: absolute file names are always made relative when combining. Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos Santos for support.
  - Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the branch was missed. It said the pattern never matched, when actually the branch is missed if the last case always matched.
  - Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.
  - Fix: the `report:format` setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a string. Thanks, [Tanaydin Sirin](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754). It is also now documented on the \[configuration page \<config\_report\_format\>\](\#configuration-page-\<config\_report\_format\>).

## Version 7.4.3 — 2024-02-23

  - Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: "Set changed size during iteration." This is now fixed, closing [issue 1733](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733).

## Version 7.4.2 — 2024-02-20

  - Fix: setting `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` no longer errors on 3.11 and lower, thanks [Hugo van Kemenade](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1747). It now issues a warning that sys.monitoring is not available and falls back to the default core instead.

## Version 7.4.1 — 2024-01-26

  - Python 3.13.0a3 is supported.
  - Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number, closing [issue 1732](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1732).

## Version 7.4.0 — 2023-12-27

  - In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new `sys.monitoring <python:sys.monitoring>` module by defining a `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` environment variable. This should be faster for line coverage, but not for branch coverage, and plugins and dynamic contexts are not yet supported with it. I am very interested to hear how it works (or doesn't\!) for you.

## Version 7.3.4 — 2023-12-20

  - Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other forms of nested clauses being excluded properly. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1713](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1713).
  - Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won't select the line numbers also. Thanks, [Robert Harris](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1717).

## Version 7.3.3 — 2023-12-14

  - Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded by matching any of the lines, closing [issue 684](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/684). Thanks, [Jan Rusak, Maciej Kowalczyk and Joanna Ejzel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1705).
  - Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric components that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like `file1.py` and `file001.py`. Fixes [issue 1709](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1709).
  - The `coverage annotate` command used to announce that it would be removed in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it, so it will stay. Don't expect it to keep up with other new features though.
  - Added new \[debug options \<cmd\_run\_debug\>\](\#debug-options-\<cmd\_run\_debug\>):
      - `pytest` writes the pytest test name into the debug output.
      - `dataop2` writes the full data being added to CoverageData objects.

## Version 7.3.2 — 2023-10-02

  - The `coverage lcov` command ignored the `[report] exclude_lines` and `[report] exclude_also` settings ([issue 1684](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684)). This is now fixed, thanks [Jacqueline Lee](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685).
  - Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database files. These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining data files. Now they are always ignored, fixing [issue 1605](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605). Thanks to Brad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.
  - On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be a little faster.
  - The new 3.12 soft keyword `type` is properly bolded in HTML reports.
  - Removed the "fullcoverage" feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of early-imported standard library modules. CPython [stopped using it](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054) in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.

## Version 7.3.1 — 2023-09-06

  - The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in the docs. A leading or trailing star matches any number of path components, like a double star would. This is different than the behavior of a star in the middle of a pattern. This discrepancy was [identified by Sviatoslav Sydorenko](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407#issuecomment-1631085209), who [provided patient detailed diagnosis](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1650) and graciously agreed to a pragmatic resolution.
  - The API docs were missing from the last version. They are now [restored](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_coverage.html).

## Version 7.3.0 — 2023-08-12

  - Added a <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.collect</span> context manager to start and stop coverage data collection.
  - Dropped support for Python 3.7.
  - Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to asynchronous mode. Coverage.py would fail with the error `Safety level may not be changed inside a transaction.` This is now avoided, closing [issue 1646](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1646). Thanks to Michael Bell for the detailed bug report.
  - Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate examples for the different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, and tox.ini.
  - Fix: added `nosemgrep` comments to our JavaScript code so that semgrep-based SAST security checks won't raise false alarms about security problems that aren't problems.
  - Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to [Ken Schackart](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1641).

## Version 7.2.7 — 2023-05-29

  - Fix: reverted a [change from 6.4.3](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347) that helped Cython, but also increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as described in the now-fixed [issue 1586](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1586). The problem is now avoided due to a recent change ([issue 1538](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538)). Thanks to [Anders Kaseorg](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1629) and David Szotten for persisting with problem reports and detailed diagnoses.
  - Wheels are now provided for CPython 3.12.

## Version 7.2.6 — 2023-05-23

  - Fix: the `lcov` command could raise an IndexError exception if a file is translated to Python but then executed under its own name. Jinja2 does this when rendering templates. Fixes [issue 1553](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1553).
  - Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions. Previously they were compiled as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn you if they weren't completely executed. This no longer happens under Python 3.12.
  - Fix: the `coverage debug sys` command includes some environment variables in its output. This could have included sensitive data. Those values are now hidden with asterisks, closing [issue 1628](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1628).

## Version 7.2.5 — 2023-04-30

  - Fix: `html_report()` could fail with an AttributeError on `isatty` if run in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced. This is now fixed.

## Version 7.2.4 — 2023-04-28

PyCon 2023 sprint fixes\!

  - Fix: with `relative_files = true`, specifying a specific file to include or omit wouldn't work correctly ([issue 1604](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1604)). This is now fixed, with testing help by [Marc Gibbons](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1608).
  - Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect `<source>` element when using relative files and the source option ended with a slash ([issue 1541](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1541)). This is now fixed, thanks to [Kevin Brown-Silva](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1608).
  - When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it's now a terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to open the HTML file in your browser. Finishes [issue 1523](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1523) thanks to [Ricardo Newbery](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1613).
  - Docs: a new \[Migrating page \<migrating\>\](\#migrating-page-\<migrating\>) with details about how to migrate between major versions of coverage.py. It currently covers the wildcard changes in 7.x. Thanks, [Brian Grohe](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1610).

## Version 7.2.3 — 2023-04-06

  - Fix: the \[config\_run\_sigterm\](\#config\_run\_sigterm) setting was meant to capture data if a process was terminated with a SIGTERM signal, but it didn't always. This was fixed thanks to [Lewis Gaul](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1600), closing [issue 1599](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1599).
  - Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much more compact. File sizes are typically as small as one-third the previous size, but can be dramatically smaller. This closes [issue 1584](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1584) thanks to [Oleh Krehel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1587).
  - Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing [issue 1592](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1592).

## Version 7.2.2 — 2023-03-16

  - Fix: if a virtualenv was created inside a source directory, and a sourced package was installed inside the virtualenv, then all of the third-party packages inside the virtualenv would be measured. This was incorrect, but has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be measured, thanks to [Manuel Jacob](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1560).
  - Fix: the `coverage lcov` command could create a .lcov file with incorrect LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals. This is now fixed, thanks to [Ian Moore](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1583).
  - Fix: the `coverage xml` command on Windows could create a .xml file with duplicate `<package>` elements. This is now fixed, thanks to [Benjamin Parzella](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1574), closing [issue 1573](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1573).

## Version 7.2.1 — 2023-02-26

  - Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages, but no longer does, closing [issue 1566](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1566).
  - Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly indicated so that mypy will find them, fixing [issue 1564](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1564).

## Version 7.2.0 — 2023-02-22

  - Added a new setting `[report] exclude_also` to let you add more exclusions without overwriting the defaults. Thanks, [Alpha Chen](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1557), closing [issue 1391](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1391).
  - Added a <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.purge\_files</span> method to remove recorded data for a particular file. Contributed by [Stephan Deibel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1547).
  - Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer congratulate themselves with messages like "Wrote XML report to file.xml" before spewing a traceback about their failure.
  - Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now accept pathlib.Path objects. This includes the `data_file` and `config_file` arguments to the Coverage constructor and the `basename` argument to CoverageData. Closes [issue 1552](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1552).
  - Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur on stop() when the originating thread exits before completion. This is now fixed, thanks to [Russell Keith-Magee](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1543), closing [issue 1542](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1542).
  - Added a `py.typed` file to announce our type-hintedness. Thanks, [KotlinIsland](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1550).

## Version 7.1.0 — 2023-01-24

  - Added: the debug output file can now be specified with `[run] debug_file` in the configuration file. Closes [issue 1319](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1319).
  - Performance: fixed a slowdown with dynamic contexts that's been around since 6.4.3. The fix closes [issue 1538](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538). Thankfully this doesn't break the [Cython change](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347) that fixed [issue 972](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972). Thanks to Mathieu Kniewallner for the deep investigative work and comprehensive issue report.
  - Typing: all product and test code has type annotations.

## Version 7.0.5 — 2023-01-10

  - Fix: On Python 3.7, a file with type annotations but no `from __future__ import annotations` would be missing statements in the coverage report. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1524](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1524).

## Version 7.0.4 — 2023-01-07

  - Performance: an internal cache of file names was accidentally disabled, resulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1527](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527). Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test case.

## Version 7.0.3 — 2023-01-03

  - Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining step could fail with `assert row is not None` using 7.0.2. This was due to a race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In 7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code. Now it will produce a message "Couldn't combine data file" and ignore the data file as it used to do before 7.0.2. Closes [issue 1522](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522).

## Version 7.0.2 — 2023-01-02

  - Fix: when using the `[run] relative_files = True` setting, a relative `[paths]` pattern was still being made absolute. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1519](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519).
  - Fix: if Python doesn't provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can only be read if coverage.py is installed with the `[toml]` extra. Coverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees your settings are in a .toml file. But it didn't understand that `[tools.coverage]` was a valid section header, so the error wasn't reported if you used that header, and settings were silently ignored. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1516](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516).
  - Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing [issue 1515](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515).
  - Fix: the `coverage lcov` report did not properly implement the `--fail-under=MIN` option. This has been fixed.
  - Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings. This should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some places, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.
  - Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and IronPython.

## Version 7.0.1 — 2022-12-23

  - When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists, we weren't considering files in .whl files. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1511](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1511).
  - File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and curly braces in directory and file names. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1513](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1513).
  - Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could prevent reporting. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1512](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1512).
  - The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing [issue 1510](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1510).

## Version 7.0.0 — 2022-12-18

Nothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.

## Version 7.0.0b1 — 2022-12-03

A number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern matching and path remapping with the `[paths]` setting (see \[config\_paths\](\#config\_paths)). These changes might affect you, and require you to update your settings.

(This release includes the changes from [6.6.0b1](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-6-6-0b1), since 6.6.0 was never released.)

  - Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your configuration:
      - Previously, `*` would incorrectly match directory separators, making precise matching difficult. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1407](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407).
      - Now `**` matches any number of nested directories, including none.
  - Improvements to combining data files when using the \[config\_run\_relative\_files\](\#config\_run\_relative\_files) setting, which might require updating your configuration:
      - During `coverage combine`, relative file paths are implicitly combined without needing a `[paths]` configuration setting. This also fixed [issue 991](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991).
      - A `[paths]` setting like `*/foo` will now match `foo/bar.py` so that relative file paths can be combined more easily.
      - The \[config\_run\_relative\_files\](\#config\_run\_relative\_files) setting is properly interpreted in more places, fixing [issue 1280](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280).
  - When remapping file paths with `[paths]`, a path will be remapped only if the resulting path exists. The documentation has long said the prefix had to exist, but it was never enforced. This fixes [issue 608](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/608), improves [issue 649](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/649), and closes [issue 757](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/757).
  - Reporting operations now implicitly use the `[paths]` setting to remap file paths within a single data file. Combining multiple files still requires the `coverage combine` step, but this simplifies some single-file situations. Closes [issue 1212](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1212) and [issue 713](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/713).
  - The `coverage report` command now has a `--format=` option. The original style is now `--format=text`, and is the default.
      - Using `--format=markdown` will write the table in Markdown format, thanks to [Steve Oswald](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1479), closing [issue 1418](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1418).
      - Using `--format=total` will write a single total number to the output. This can be useful for making badges or writing status updates.
  - Combining data files with `coverage combine` now hashes the data files to skip files that add no new information. This can reduce the time needed. Many details affect the speed-up, but for coverage.py's own test suite, combining is about 40% faster. Closes [issue 1483](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1483).
  - When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py uses the presence of `__init__.py` files to determine which directories have source that could have been imported. However, [implicit namespace packages](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) don't require `__init__.py`. A new setting `[report] include_namespace_packages` tells coverage.py to consider these directories during reporting. Thanks to [Felix Horvat](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1387) for the contribution. Closes [issue 1383](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1383) and [issue 1024](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1024).
  - Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files. It was overly broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in [issue 1481](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481) and [issue 1345](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345). This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment substitution.
  - An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail with `--fail-under`. This has been fixed, closing [issue 1470](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1470).
  - The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines if there are no files listed in the table. One is plenty.
  - Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard alternatives in match/case statements, closing [issue 1421](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1421).
  - Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on implementations other than CPython or PyPy ([issue 1474](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474)).
  - The deprecated `[run] note` setting has been completely removed.

## Version 6.6.0b1 — 2022-10-31

(Note: 6.6.0 final was never released. These changes are part of [7.0.0b1](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-7-0-0b1).)

  - Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your configuration:
      - Previously, `*` would incorrectly match directory separators, making precise matching difficult. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1407](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407).
      - Now `**` matches any number of nested directories, including none.
  - Improvements to combining data files when using the \[config\_run\_relative\_files\](\#config\_run\_relative\_files) setting:
      - During `coverage combine`, relative file paths are implicitly combined without needing a `[paths]` configuration setting. This also fixed [issue 991](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991).
      - A `[paths]` setting like `*/foo` will now match `foo/bar.py` so that relative file paths can be combined more easily.
      - The setting is properly interpreted in more places, fixing [issue 1280](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280).
  - Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files. It was overly broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in [issue 1481](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481) and [issue 1345](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345). This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment substitution.
  - Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on implementations other than CPython or PyPy ([issue 1474](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474)).

## Version 6.5.0 — 2022-09-29

  - The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which are missing for each file. Thanks, [Christoph Blessing](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1438). Closes [issue 1425](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1425).
  - Starting with coverage.py 6.2, `class` statements were marked as a branch. This wasn't right, and has been reverted, fixing [issue 1449](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1449). Note this will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch coverage.
  - Packaging is now compliant with [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/), closing [issue 1395](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1395).
  - A new debug option `--debug=pathmap` shows details of the remapping of paths that happens during combine due to the `[paths]` setting.
  - Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing. Found by OSS-Fuzz, fixing their [bug 50381](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50381).

## Version 6.4.4 — 2022-08-16

  - Wheels are now provided for Python 3.11.

## Version 6.4.3 — 2022-08-06

  - Fix a failure when combining data files if the file names contained glob-like patterns. Thanks, [Michael Krebs and Benjamin Schubert](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1405).
  - Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different drive than the current directory, closing [issue 1428](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1428). Thanks, [Lorenzo Micò](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1430).
  - Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in a Docker container. Thanks [Arthur Rio](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1403).
  - Filtering in the HTML report wouldn't work when reloading the index page. This is now fixed. Thanks, [Marc Legendre](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1413).
  - Fix a problem with Cython code measurement, closing [issue 972](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972). Thanks, [Matus Valo](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347).

## Version 6.4.2 — 2022-07-12

  - Updated for a small change in Python 3.11.0 beta 4: modules now start with a line with line number 0, which is ignored. This line cannot be executed, so coverage totals were thrown off. This line is now ignored by coverage.py, but this also means that truly empty modules (like `__init__.py`) have no lines in them, rather than one phantom line. Fixes [issue 1419](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1419).
  - Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to avoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules. Thanks, [Yilei Yang](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1399).

## Version 6.4.1 — 2022-06-02

  - Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that need the pure Python trace function. Thanks, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick ([pull 1381](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1381) and [pull 1388](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1388)). Slightly improved performance when using the C trace function, as most environments do. Closes [issue 1339](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1339).
  - The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have been made more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to work. Closes [issue 1390](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1390).

## Version 6.4 — 2022-05-22

  - A new setting, \[config\_run\_sigterm\](\#config\_run\_sigterm), controls whether a SIGTERM signal handler is used. In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed, to capture data at unusual process ends. Unfortunately, this introduced other problems (see [issue 1310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310)). Now the signal handler is only used if you opt-in by setting `[run] sigterm = true`.
  - Small changes to the HTML report:
      - Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard shortcuts: `[` and `]` for next file and previous file; `u` for up to the index; and `?` to open/close the help panel. Thanks, [J. M. F. Tsang](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1364).
      - The time stamp and version are displayed at the top of the report. Thanks, [Ammar Askar](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1354). Closes [issue 1351](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1351).
  - A new debug option `debug=sqldata` adds more detail to `debug=sql`, logging all the data being written to the database.
  - Previously, running `coverage report` (or any of the reporting commands) in an empty directory would create a .coverage data file. Now they do not, fixing [issue 1328](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1328).
  - On Python 3.11, the `[toml]` extra no longer installs tomli, instead using tomllib from the standard library. Thanks [Shantanu](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1359).
  - In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing [issue 1323](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1323).

## Version 6.3.3 — 2022-05-12

  - Fix: Coverage.py now builds successfully on CPython 3.11 (3.11.0b1) again. Closes [issue 1367](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1367). Some results for generators may have changed.

## Version 6.3.2 — 2022-02-20

  - Fix: adapt to pypy3.9's decorator tracing behavior. It now traces function decorators like CPython 3.8: both the @-line and the def-line are traced. Fixes [issue 1326](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1326).
  - Debug: added `pybehave` to the list of \[coverage debug \<cmd\_debug\>\](\#coverage-debug-\<cmd\_debug\>) and \[cmd\_run\_debug\](\#cmd\_run\_debug) options.
  - Fix: show an intelligible error message if `--concurrency=multiprocessing` is used without a configuration file. Closes [issue 1320](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1320).

## Version 6.3.1 — 2022-02-01

  - Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes. Some of these deadlocks (described in [issue 1310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310)) are now fixed.
  - Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing an error: "ValueError: signal only works in main thread". This is now fixed, closing [issue 1312](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1312).
  - Fix: `--precision` on the command-line was being ignored while considering `--fail-under`. This is now fixed, thanks to [Marcelo Trylesinski](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1317).
  - Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py uses CPython internal fields which are moving during the alpha phase. Fixes [issue 1316](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1316).

## Version 6.3 — 2022-01-25

  - Feature: Added the `lcov` command to generate reports in LCOV format. Thanks, [Bradley Burns](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1289). Closes issues [587](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/587) and [626](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/626).
  - Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the command line with the `--data-file` option in any command that reads or writes data. This is in addition to the existing `COVERAGE_FILE` environment variable. Closes [issue 624](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/624). Thanks, [Nikita Bloshchanevich](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1304).
  - Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a SIGTERM signal is received by the process. This includes <span class="title-ref">Process.terminate \<python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate\></span>, and other ways to terminate a process. Currently this is only on Linux and Mac; Windows is not supported. Fixes [issue 1307](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1307).
  - Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on 2021-12-23.
  - Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing [issue 1294](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1294).
  - Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way, to avoid problems when multiple processes are trying to write data at once. Fixes issues [1303](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1303) and [883](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/883).
  - Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report output directory if the directory is empty. This should prevent certain unfortunate accidents of writing the file where it is not wanted.
  - Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing [issue 1288](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1288).

## Version 6.2 — 2021-11-26

  - Feature: Now the `--concurrency` setting can have a list of values, so that threads and another lightweight threading package can be measured together, such as `--concurrency=gevent,thread`. Closes [issue 1012](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1012) and [issue 1082](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1082). This also means that `thread` must be explicitly specified in some cases that used to be implicit such as `--concurrency=multiprocessing`, which must be changed to `--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread`.
  - Fix: A module specified as the `source` setting is imported during startup, before the user program imports it. This could cause problems if the rest of the program isn't ready yet. For example, [issue 1203](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1203) describes a Django setting that is accessed before settings have been configured. Now the early import is wrapped in a try/except so errors then don't stop execution.
  - Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion to end too early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated function. This is now fixed.
  - Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file that already exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for [issue 1244](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244)).
  - API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been specialized, to provide finer-grained catching of exceptions by third-party code.
  - API: Using `suffix=False` when constructing a Coverage object with multiprocessing wouldn't suppress the data file suffix ([issue 989](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/989)). This is now fixed.
  - Debug: The `coverage debug data` command will now sniff out combinable data files, and report on all of them.
  - Debug: The `coverage debug` command used to accept a number of topics at a time, and show all of them, though this was never documented. This no longer works, to allow for command-line options in the future.

## Version 6.1.2 — 2021-11-10

  - Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2). One still-open issue has to do with [exits through with-statements](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1270).
  - Fix: When remapping file paths through the `[paths]` setting while combining, the `[run] relative_files` setting was ignored, resulting in absolute paths for remapped file names ([issue 1147](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1147)). This is now fixed.
  - Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have incorrectly reported a missing branch ([issue 1271](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1271)). This is now fixed.
  - Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse source files for reporting. Problems that used to terminate coverage.py can now be handled with `[report] ignore_errors`. This helps with plugins failing to read files ([django\_coverage\_plugin issue 78](https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/78)).
  - Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball ([issue 840](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840)).
  - Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an internal class. This unsupported class is being used by coveralls ([issue 1273](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1273)). Although I'd rather not "fix" unsupported interfaces, it's actually nicer with a default value.

## Version 6.1.1 — 2021-10-31

  - Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn't work unless you had branch coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky header works for everyone. (Do people still use coverage without branch measurement\!? j/k)
  - Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the "already imported a file that will be measured" warning would be issued ([issue 888](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/888)). This is now fixed.

## Version 6.1 — 2021-10-30

  - Deprecated: The `annotate` command and the `Coverage.annotate` function will be removed in a future version, unless people let me know that they are using it. Instead, the `html` command gives better-looking (and more accurate) output, and the `report -m` command will tell you line numbers of missing lines. Please get in touch if you have a reason to use `annotate` over those better options: <ned@nedbatchelder.com>.
  - Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable, `COVERAGE_RUN` when running your code with the `coverage run` command. The value is not important, and may change in the future. Closes [issue 553](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/553).
  - Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have a sticky header so the file name and controls are always visible.
  - Feature: The `xml` and `json` commands now describe what they wrote where.
  - Feature: The `html`, `combine`, `xml`, and `json` commands all accept a `-q/--quiet` option to suppress the messages they write to stdout about what they are doing ([issue 1254](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1254)).
  - Feature: The `html` command writes a `.gitignore` file into the HTML output directory, to prevent the report from being committed to git. If you want to commit it, you will need to delete that file. Closes [issue 1244](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244).
  - Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.
  - Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement. Code such as [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/) boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured though the synthetic line numbers meant they were never reported. Once Cython was involved though, the generated .so files were parsed as Python, raising syntax errors, as reported in [issue 1160](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1160). This is now fixed.
  - Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are sorted correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py. This applies to file names, module names, environment variables, and test contexts.
  - Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you might only notice on code that is executed many times, such as long-running loops.
  - Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored ([issue 840](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840) and [issue 1118](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1118)). Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the conversion to vanilla JavaScript in [pull request 1248](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1248).

## Version 6.0.2 — 2021-10-11

  - Namespace packages being measured weren't properly handled by the new code that ignores third-party packages. If the namespace package was installed, it was ignored as a third-party package. That problem ([issue 1231](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1231)) is now fixed.
  - Packages named as "source packages" (with `source`, or `source_pkgs`, or pytest-cov's `--cov`) might have been only partially measured. Their top-level statements could be marked as un-executed, because they were imported by coverage.py before measurement began ([issue 1232](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1232)). This is now fixed, but the package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then again by your test suite. This could cause problems if importing the package has side effects.
  - The <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.contexts\_by\_lineno</span> method was documented to return a dict, but was returning a defaultdict. Now it returns a plain dict. It also no longer returns negative numbered keys.

## Version 6.0.1 — 2021-10-06

  - In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the public supported API, CoverageException is. But a number of other third-party packages were importing the exceptions from coverage.misc, so they are now available from there again ([issue 1226](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1226)).
  - Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that tomli can use coverage.py for their own test suite ([issue 1228](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1228)).
  - Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation, where a function can have an argument called "self", but no local named "self" ([pull request 1210](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1210)). Thanks, Ben Carlsson.

## Version 6.0 — 2021-10-03

  - The `coverage html` command now prints a message indicating where the HTML report was written. Fixes [issue 1195](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1195).
  - The `coverage combine` command now prints messages indicating each data file being combined. Fixes [issue 1105](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1105).
  - The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due to `skip_covered` or `skip_empty` settings. Fixes [issue 1163](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1163).
  - Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer errors. They are now warnings, to ease the use of coverage across versions. Fixes [issue 1035](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1035).
  - Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python 3.10. A missing exception is no longer considered a missing branch from the with statement. Fixes [issue 1205](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1205).
  - Fix another rarer instance of "Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type." ([issue 1010](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010)).
  - Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer against conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously ([pull 1220](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1220)). Thanks, Clément Pit-Claudel.

## Version 6.0b1 — 2021-07-18

  - Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.
  - Added support for the Python 3.10 `match/case` syntax.
  - Data collection is now thread-safe. There may have been rare instances of exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.
  - Plugins (like the [Django coverage plugin](https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/)) were generating "Already imported a file that will be measured" warnings about Django itself. These have been fixed, closing [issue 1150](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1150).
  - Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.
  - Using `--fail-under=100` with coverage near 100% could result in the self-contradictory message `total of 100 is less than fail-under=100`. This bug ([issue 1168](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1168)) is now fixed.
  - The `COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE` environment variable now accepts `stdout` and `stderr` to write to those destinations.
  - TOML parsing now uses the [tomli](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/) library.
  - Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML report:
      - Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for high-security environments ([issue 1189](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1189)). When generating the HTML report, we save the hash of the data, to avoid regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to use MD5 to generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256. This was never a security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5 algorithm and raise a false alarm.
      - Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading underscores ([issue 1167](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1167)), to avoid rare file name collisions ([issue 584](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/584)), and to avoid file names becoming too long ([issue 580](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/580)).

## Version 5.6b1 — 2021-04-13

Note: 5.6 final was never released. These changes are part of 6.0.

  - Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting. This solves a few problems:
      - Coverage will no longer report about other people's code ([issue 876](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876)). This is true even when using `--source=.` with a venv in the current directory.
      - Coverage will no longer generate "Already imported a file that will be measured" warnings about coverage itself ([issue 905](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905)).
  - The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of code. They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior. Now the highlighting is working again.
  - The JSON report now includes `percent_covered_display`, a string with the total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other reports' totals.

## Version 5.5 — 2021-02-28

  - `coverage combine` has a new option, `--keep` to keep the original data files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files after they have been combined. This was requested in [issue 1108](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108) and implemented in [pull request 1110](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110). Thanks, Éric Larivière.
  - When reporting missing branches in `coverage report`, branches aren't reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches are only reported if both the source and destination lines are executed. Closes both [issue 1065](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065) and [issue 955](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955).
  - Minor improvements to the HTML report:
      - The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage so you don't have to fiddle with them so often, fixing [issue 1123](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123).
      - It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work well, fixing [issue 1124](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124).
  - Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users will be more likely to understand what's happening, closing [issue 803](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803).

## Version 5.4 — 2021-01-24

  - The text report produced by `coverage report` now always outputs a TOTAL line, even if only one Python file is reported. This makes regex parsing of the output easier. Thanks, Judson Neer. This had been requested a number of times ([issue 1086](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086), [issue 922](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922), [issue 732](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732)).
  - The `skip_covered` and `skip_empty` settings in the configuration file can now be specified in the `[html]` section, so that text reports and HTML reports can use separate settings. The HTML report will still use the `[report]` settings if there isn't a value in the `[html]` section. Closes [issue 1090](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090).
  - Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing [issue 577](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577). Thanks, [Valentin Lab](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080).
  - Fix an obscure warning from deep in the \_decimal module, as reported in [issue 1084](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084).
  - Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including [PEP 626: Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/).

## Version 5.3.1 — 2020-12-19

  - When using `--source` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous versions. This performance regression is now fixed, closing [issue 1037](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037).
  - Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in [issue 1010](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010). An immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying solution.
  - The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way, fixing [issue 986](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986). Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez ([pull request 1066](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066)).
  - The HTML report pages now have a \[Sleepy Snake \<sleepy\>\](\#sleepy-snake-\<sleepy\>) favicon.
  - Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).
  - Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.

## Version 5.3 — 2020-09-13

  - The `source` setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a module, depending on which existed. If both interpretations were valid, it was assumed to be a file path. The new `source_pkgs` setting can be used to name a package to disambiguate this case. Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes [issue 268](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268).
  - If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record its information, causing an exception, as reported in [issue 1011](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011). This is now fixed.

## Older changes

>     endchangesinclude

## Version 5.2.1 — 2020-07-23

  - The dark mode HTML report still used light colors for the context listing, making them unreadable ([issue 1009](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1009)). This is now fixed.
  - The time stamp on the HTML report now includes the time zone. Thanks, Xie Yanbo ([pull request 960](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/960)).

## Version 5.2 — 2020-07-05

  - The HTML report has been redesigned by Vince Salvino. There is now a dark mode, the code text is larger, and system sans serif fonts are used, in addition to other small changes ([issue 858](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/858) and [pull request 931](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/931)).
  - The `coverage report` and `coverage html` commands now accept a `--precision` option to control the number of decimal points displayed. Thanks, Teake Nutma ([pull request 982](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/982)).
  - The `coverage report` and `coverage html` commands now accept a `--no-skip-covered` option to negate `--skip-covered`. Thanks, Anthony Sottile ([issue 779](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/779) and [pull request 932](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/932)).
  - The `--skip-empty` option is now available for the XML report, closing [issue 976](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/976).
  - The `coverage report` command now accepts a `--sort` option to specify how to sort the results. Thanks, Jerin Peter George ([pull request 1005](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1005)).
  - If coverage fails due to the coverage total not reaching the `--fail-under` value, it will now print a message making the condition clear. Thanks, Naveen Yadav ([pull request 977](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/977)).
  - TOML configuration files with non-ASCII characters would cause errors on Windows ([issue 990](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/990)). This is now fixed.
  - The output of `--debug=trace` now includes information about how the `--source` option is being interpreted, and the module names being considered.

## Version 5.1 — 2020-04-12

  - The JSON report now includes counts of covered and missing branches. Thanks, Salvatore Zagaria.
  - On Python 3.8, try-finally-return reported wrong branch coverage with decorated async functions ([issue 964](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/964)). This is now fixed. Thanks, Kjell Braden.
  - The <span class="title-ref">\~coverage.Coverage.get\_option</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~coverage.Coverage.set\_option</span> methods can now manipulate the `[paths]` configuration setting. Thanks to Bernát Gábor for the fix for [issue 967](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/967).

## Version 5.0.4 — 2020-03-16

  - If using the `[run] relative_files` setting, the XML report will use relative files in the `<source>` elements indicating the location of source code. Closes [issue 948](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/948).
  - The textual summary report could report missing lines with negative line numbers on PyPy3 7.1 ([issue 943](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/943)). This is now fixed.
  - Windows wheels for Python 3.8 were incorrectly built, but are now fixed. ([issue 949](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/949))
  - Updated Python 3.9 support to 3.9a4.
  - HTML reports couldn't be sorted if localStorage wasn't available. This is now fixed: sorting works even though the sorting setting isn't retained. ([issue 944](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/944) and [pull request 945](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/945)). Thanks, Abdeali Kothari.

## Version 5.0.3 — 2020-01-12

  - A performance improvement in 5.0.2 didn't work for test suites that changed directory before combining data, causing "Couldn't use data file: no such table: meta" errors ([issue 916](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/916)). This is now fixed.
  - Coverage could fail to run your program with some form of "ModuleNotFound" or "ImportError" trying to import from the current directory. This would happen if coverage had been packaged into a zip file (for example, on Windows), or was found indirectly (for example, by pyenv-virtualenv). A number of different scenarios were described in [issue 862](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/862) which is now fixed. Huge thanks to Agbonze O. Jeremiah for reporting it, and Alexander Waters and George-Cristian Bîrzan for protracted debugging sessions.
  - Added the "premain" debug option.
  - Added SQLite compile-time options to the "debug sys" output.

## Version 5.0.2 — 2020-01-05

  - Programs that used multiprocessing and changed directories would fail under coverage. This is now fixed ([issue 890](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/890)). A side effect is that debug information about the config files read now shows absolute paths to the files.
  - When running programs as modules (`coverage run -m`) with `--source`, some measured modules were imported before coverage starts. This resulted in unwanted warnings ("Already imported a file that will be measured") and a reduction in coverage totals ([issue 909](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/909)). This is now fixed.
  - If no data was collected, an exception about "No data to report" could happen instead of a 0% report being created ([issue 884](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/884)). This is now fixed.
  - The handling of source files with non-encodable file names has changed. Previously, if a file name could not be encoded as UTF-8, an error occurred, as described in [issue 891](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/891). Now, those files will not be measured, since their data would not be recordable.
  - A new warning ("dynamic-conflict") is issued if two mechanisms are trying to change the dynamic context. Closes [issue 901](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/901).
  - `coverage run --debug=sys` would fail with an AttributeError. This is now fixed ([issue 907](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/907)).

## Version 5.0.1 — 2019-12-22

  - If a 4.x data file is the cause of a "file is not a database" error, then use a more specific error message, "Looks like a coverage 4.x data file, are you mixing versions of coverage?" Helps diagnose the problems described in [issue 886](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/886).
  - Measurement contexts and relative file names didn't work together, as reported in [issue 899](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/899) and [issue 900](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/900). This is now fixed, thanks to David Szotten.
  - When using `coverage run --concurrency=multiprocessing`, all data files should be named with parallel-ready suffixes. 5.0 mistakenly named the main process' file with no suffix when using `--append`. This is now fixed, closing [issue 880](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/880).
  - Fixed a problem on Windows when the current directory is changed to a different drive ([issue 895](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/895)). Thanks, Olivier Grisel.
  - Updated Python 3.9 support to 3.9a2.

## Version 5.0 — 2019-12-14

Nothing new beyond 5.0b2.

A summary of major changes in 5.0 since 4.5.x is in see \[whatsnew5x\](\#whatsnew5x).

## Version 5.0b2 — 2019-12-08

  - An experimental `[run] relative_files` setting tells coverage to store relative file names in the data file. This makes it easier to run tests in one (or many) environments, and then report in another. It has not had much real-world testing, so it may change in incompatible ways in the future.
  - When constructing a <span class="title-ref">coverage.Coverage</span> object, <span class="title-ref">data\_file</span> can be specified as None to prevent writing any data file at all. In previous versions, an explicit <span class="title-ref">data\_file=None</span> argument would use the default of ".coverage". Fixes [issue 871](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/871).
  - Python files run with `-m` now have `__spec__` defined properly. This fixes [issue 745](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/745) (about not being able to run unittest tests that spawn subprocesses), and [issue 838](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/838), which described the problem directly.
  - The `[paths]` configuration section is now ordered. If you specify more than one list of patterns, the first one that matches will be used. Fixes [issue 649](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/649).
  - The <span class="title-ref">.coverage.numbits.register\_sqlite\_functions</span> function now also registers <span class="title-ref">numbits\_to\_nums</span> for use in SQLite queries. Thanks, Simon Willison.
  - Python 3.9a1 is supported.
  - Coverage.py has a mascot: \[Sleepy Snake \<sleepy\>\](\#sleepy-snake-\<sleepy\>).

## Version 5.0b1 — 2019-11-11

  - The HTML and textual reports now have a `--skip-empty` option that skips files with no statements, notably `__init__.py` files. Thanks, Reya B.
  - Configuration can now be read from [TOML](https://toml.io/) files. This requires installing coverage.py with the `[toml]` extra. The standard "pyproject.toml" file will be read automatically if no other configuration file is found, with settings in the `[tool.coverage.]` namespace. Thanks to Frazer McLean for implementation and persistence. Finishes [issue 664](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/664).
  - The `[run] note` setting has been deprecated. Using it will result in a warning, and the note will not be written to the data file. The corresponding <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> methods have been removed.
  - The HTML report has been reimplemented (no more table around the source code). This allowed for a better presentation of the context information, hopefully resolving [issue 855](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/855).
  - Added sqlite3 module version information to `coverage debug sys` output.
  - Asking the HTML report to show contexts (`[html] show_contexts=True` or `coverage html --show-contexts`) will issue a warning if there were no contexts measured ([issue 851](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/851)).

## Version 5.0a8 — 2019-10-02

  - The <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> API has changed how queries are limited to specific contexts. Now you use <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.set\_query\_context</span> to set a single exact-match string, or <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.set\_query\_contexts</span> to set a list of regular expressions to match contexts. This changes the command-line `--contexts` option to use regular expressions instead of filename-style wildcards.

## Version 5.0a7 — 2019-09-21

  - Data can now be "reported" in JSON format, for programmatic use, as requested in [issue 720](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/720). The new `coverage json` command writes raw and summarized data to a JSON file. Thanks, Matt Bachmann.
  - Dynamic contexts are now supported in the Python tracer, which is important for PyPy users. Closes [issue 846](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/846).
  - The compact line number representation introduced in 5.0a6 is called a "numbits." The `coverage.numbits` module provides functions for working with them.
  - The reporting methods used to permanently apply their arguments to the configuration of the Coverage object. Now they no longer do. The arguments affect the operation of the method, but do not persist.
  - A class named "test\_something" no longer confuses the `test_function` dynamic context setting. Fixes [issue 829](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/829).
  - Fixed an unusual tokenizing issue with backslashes in comments. Fixes [issue 822](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/822).
  - `debug=plugin` didn't properly support configuration or dynamic context plugins, but now it does, closing [issue 834](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/834).

## Version 5.0a6 — 2019-07-16

  - Reporting on contexts. Big thanks to Stephan Richter and Albertas Agejevas for the contribution.
      - The `--contexts` option is available on the `report` and `html` commands. It's a comma-separated list of shell-style wildcards, selecting the contexts to report on. Only contexts matching one of the wildcards will be included in the report.
      - The `--show-contexts` option for the `html` command adds context information to each covered line. Hovering over the "ctx" marker at the end of the line reveals a list of the contexts that covered the line.
  - Database changes:
      - Line numbers are now stored in a much more compact way. For each file and context, a single binary string is stored with a bit per line number. This greatly improves memory use, but makes ad-hoc use difficult.
      - Dynamic contexts with no data are no longer written to the database.
      - SQLite data storage is now faster. There's no longer a reason to keep the JSON data file code, so it has been removed.
  - Changes to the <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> interface:
      - The new <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.dumps</span> method serializes the data to a string, and a corresponding <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData.loads</span> method reconstitutes this data. The format of the data string is subject to change at any time, and so should only be used between two installations of the same version of coverage.py.
      - The <span class="title-ref">CoverageData constructor\<.CoverageData\></span> has a new argument, <span class="title-ref">no\_disk</span> (default: False). Setting it to True prevents writing any data to the disk. This is useful for transient data objects.
  - Added the class method <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.current</span> to get the latest started Coverage instance.
  - Multiprocessing support in Python 3.8 was broken, but is now fixed. Closes [issue 828](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/828).
  - Error handling during reporting has changed slightly. All reporting methods now behave the same. The `--ignore-errors` option keeps errors from stopping the reporting, but files that couldn't parse as Python will always be reported as warnings. As with other warnings, you can suppress them with the `[run] disable_warnings` configuration setting.
  - Coverage.py no longer fails if the user program deletes its current directory. Fixes [issue 806](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/806). Thanks, Dan Hemberger.
  - The scrollbar markers in the HTML report now accurately show the highlighted lines, regardless of what categories of line are highlighted.
  - The hack to accommodate [ShiningPanda](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shiningpanda/) looking for an obsolete internal data file has been removed, since ShiningPanda 0.22 fixed it four years ago.
  - The deprecated <span class="title-ref">Reporter.file\_reporters</span> property has been removed.

## Version 5.0a5 — 2019-05-07

  - Drop support for Python 3.4
  - Dynamic contexts can now be set two new ways, both thanks to Justas Sadzevičius.
      - A plugin can implement a `dynamic_context` method to check frames for whether a new context should be started. See \[dynamic\_context\_plugins\](\#dynamic\_context\_plugins) for more details.
      - Another tool (such as a test runner) can use the new <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.switch\_context</span> method to explicitly change the context.
  - The `dynamic_context = test_function` setting now works with Python 2 old-style classes, though it only reports the method name, not the class it was defined on. Closes [issue 797](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/797).
  - `fail_under` values more than 100 are reported as errors. Thanks to Mike Fiedler for closing [issue 746](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/746).
  - The "missing" values in the text output are now sorted by line number, so that missing branches are reported near the other lines they affect. The values used to show all missing lines, and then all missing branches.
  - Access to the SQLite database used for data storage is now thread-safe. Thanks, Stephan Richter. This closes [issue 702](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/702).
  - Combining data stored in SQLite is now about twice as fast, fixing [issue 761](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/761). Thanks, Stephan Richter.
  - The `filename` attribute on <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> objects has been made private. You can use the `data_filename` method to get the actual file name being used to store data, and the `base_filename` method to get the original filename before parallelizing suffixes were added. This is part of fixing [issue 708](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/708).
  - Line numbers in the HTML report now align properly with source lines, even when Chrome's minimum font size is set, fixing [issue 748](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/748). Thanks Wen Ye.

## Version 5.0a4 — 2018-11-25

  - You can specify the command line to run your program with the `[run] command_line` configuration setting, as requested in [issue 695](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/695).
  - Coverage will create directories as needed for the data file if they don't exist, closing [issue 721](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/721).
  - The `coverage run` command has always adjusted the first entry in sys.path, to properly emulate how Python runs your program. Now this adjustment is skipped if sys.path\[0\] is already different than Python's default. This fixes [issue 715](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/715).
  - Improvements to context support:
      - The "no such table: meta" error is fixed.: [issue 716](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/716).
      - Combining data files is now much faster.
  - Python 3.8 (as of today\!) passes all tests.

## Version 5.0a3 — 2018-10-06

  - Context support: static contexts let you specify a label for a coverage run, which is recorded in the data, and retained when you combine files. See \[contexts\](\#contexts) for more information.
  - Dynamic contexts: specifying `[run] dynamic_context = test_function` in the config file will record the test function name as a dynamic context during execution. This is the core of "Who Tests What" ([issue 170](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/170)). Things to note:
      - There is no reporting support yet. Use SQLite to query the .coverage file for information. Ideas are welcome about how reporting could be extended to use this data.
      - There's a noticeable slow-down before any test is run.
      - Data files will now be roughly N times larger, where N is the number of tests you have. Combining data files is therefore also N times slower.
      - No other values for `dynamic_context` are recognized yet. Let me know what else would be useful. I'd like to use a pytest plugin to get better information directly from pytest, for example.
  - Environment variable substitution in configuration files now supports two syntaxes for controlling the behavior of undefined variables: if `VARNAME` is not defined, `${VARNAME?}` will raise an error, and `${VARNAME-default value}` will use "default value".
  - Partial support for Python 3.8, which has not yet released an alpha. Fixes [issue 707](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/707) and [issue 714](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/714).

## Version 5.0a2 — 2018-09-03

  - Coverage's data storage has changed. In version 4.x, .coverage files were basically JSON. Now, they are SQLite databases. This means the data file can be created earlier than it used to. A large amount of code was refactored to support this change.
      - Because the data file is created differently than previous releases, you may need `parallel=true` where you didn't before.
      - The old data format is still available (for now) by setting the environment variable `COVERAGE_STORAGE=json`. Please tell me if you think you need to keep the JSON format.
      - The database schema is guaranteed to change in the future, to support new features. I'm looking for opinions about making the schema part of the public API to coverage.py or not.
  - Development moved from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) to [GitHub](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).
  - HTML files no longer have trailing and extra white space.
  - The sort order in the HTML report is stored in local storage rather than cookies, closing [issue 611](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/611). Thanks, Federico Bond.
  - pickle2json, for converting v3 data files to v4 data files, has been removed.

## Version 5.0a1 — 2018-06-05

  - Coverage.py no longer supports Python 2.6 or 3.3.
  - The location of the configuration file can now be specified with a `COVERAGE_RCFILE` environment variable, as requested in [issue 650](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/650).
  - Namespace packages are supported on Python 3.7, where they used to cause TypeErrors about path being None. Fixes [issue 700](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/700).
  - A new warning (`already-imported`) is issued if measurable files have already been imported before coverage.py started measurement. See \[cmd\_warnings\](\#cmd\_warnings) for more information.
  - Running coverage many times for small runs in a single process should be faster, closing [issue 625](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/625). Thanks, David MacIver.
  - Large HTML report pages load faster. Thanks, Pankaj Pandey.

## Version 4.5.4 — 2019-07-29

  - Multiprocessing support in Python 3.8 was broken, but is now fixed. Closes [issue 828](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/828).

## Version 4.5.3 — 2019-03-09

  - Only packaging metadata changes.

## Version 4.5.2 — 2018-11-12

  - Namespace packages are supported on Python 3.7, where they used to cause TypeErrors about path being None. Fixes [issue 700](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/700).
  - Python 3.8 (as of today\!) passes all tests. Fixes [issue 707](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/707) and [issue 714](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/714).
  - Development moved from [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org) to [GitHub](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).

## Version 4.5.1 — 2018-02-10

  - Now that 4.5 properly separated the `[run] omit` and `[report] omit` settings, an old bug has become apparent. If you specified a package name for `[run] source`, then omit patterns weren't matched inside that package. This bug ([issue 638](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/638)) is now fixed.
  - On Python 3.7, reporting about a decorated function with no body other than a docstring would crash coverage.py with an IndexError ([issue 640](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/640)). This is now fixed.
  - Configurer plugins are now reported in the output of `--debug=sys`.

## Version 4.5 — 2018-02-03

  - A new kind of plugin is supported: configurers are invoked at start-up to allow more complex configuration than the .coveragerc file can easily do. See \[api\_plugin\](\#api\_plugin) for details. This solves the complex configuration problem described in [issue 563](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/563).
  - The `fail_under` option can now be a float. Note that you must specify the `[report] precision` configuration option for the fractional part to be used. Thanks to Lars Hupfeldt Nielsen for help with the implementation. Fixes [issue 631](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/631).
  - The `include` and `omit` options can be specified for both the `[run]` and `[report]` phases of execution. 4.4.2 introduced some incorrect interactions between those phases, where the options for one were confused for the other. This is now corrected, fixing [issue 621](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/621) and [issue 622](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/622). Thanks to Daniel Hahler for seeing more clearly than I could.
  - The `coverage combine` command used to always overwrite the data file, even when no data had been read from apparently combinable files. Now, an error is raised if we thought there were files to combine, but in fact none of them could be used. Fixes [issue 629](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/629).
  - The `coverage combine` command could get confused about path separators when combining data collected on Windows with data collected on Linux, as described in [issue 618](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/618). This is now fixed: the result path always uses the path separator specified in the `[paths]` result.
  - On Windows, the HTML report could fail when source trees are deeply nested, due to attempting to create HTML filenames longer than the 250-character maximum. Now filenames will never get much larger than 200 characters, fixing [issue 627](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/627). Thanks to Alex Sandro for helping with the fix.

## Version 4.4.2 — 2017-11-05

  - Support for Python 3.7. In some cases, class and module docstrings are no longer counted in statement totals, which could slightly change your total results.
  - Specifying both `--source` and `--include` no longer silently ignores the include setting, instead it displays a warning. Thanks, Loïc Dachary. Closes [issue 265](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/265) and [issue 101](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/101).
  - Fixed a race condition when saving data and multiple threads are tracing ([issue 581](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/581)). It could produce a "dictionary changed size during iteration" RuntimeError. I believe this mostly but not entirely fixes the race condition. A true fix would likely be too expensive. Thanks, Peter Baughman for the debugging, and Olivier Grisel for the fix with tests.
  - Configuration values which are file paths will now apply tilde-expansion, closing [issue 589](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/589).
  - Now secondary config files like tox.ini and setup.cfg can be specified explicitly, and prefixed sections like <span class="title-ref">\[coverage:run\]</span> will be read. Fixes [issue 588](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/588).
  - Be more flexible about the command name displayed by help, fixing [issue 600](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/600). Thanks, Ben Finney.

## Version 4.4.1 — 2017-05-14

  - No code changes: just corrected packaging for Python 2.7 Linux wheels.

## Version 4.4 — 2017-05-07

  - Reports could produce the wrong file names for packages, reporting `pkg.py` instead of the correct `pkg/__init__.py`. This is now fixed. Thanks, Dirk Thomas.
  - XML reports could produce `<source>` and `<class>` lines that together didn't specify a valid source file path. This is now fixed. ([issue 526](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/526))
  - Namespace packages are no longer warned as having no code. ([issue 572](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/572))
  - Code that uses `sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())` in a file that wasn't being coverage-measured would prevent correct coverage measurement in following code. An example of this was running doctests programmatically. This is now fixed. ([issue 575](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/575))
  - Errors printed by the `coverage` command now go to stderr instead of stdout.
  - Running `coverage xml` in a directory named with non-ASCII characters would fail under Python 2. This is now fixed. ([issue 573](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/573))

## Version 4.4b1 — 2017-04-04

  - Some warnings can now be individually disabled. Warnings that can be disabled have a short name appended. The `[run] disable_warnings` setting takes a list of these warning names to disable. Closes both [issue 96](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/96) and [issue 355](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/355).
  - The XML report now includes attributes from version 4 of the Cobertura XML format, fixing [issue 570](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/570).
  - In previous versions, calling a method that used collected data would prevent further collection. For example, <span class="title-ref">save()</span>, <span class="title-ref">report()</span>, <span class="title-ref">html\_report()</span>, and others would all stop collection. An explicit <span class="title-ref">start()</span> was needed to get it going again. This is no longer true. Now you can use the collected data and also continue measurement. Both [issue 79](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/79) and [issue 448](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/448) described this problem, and have been fixed.
  - Plugins can now find un-executed files if they choose, by implementing the <span class="title-ref">find\_executable\_files</span> method. Thanks, Emil Madsen.
  - Minimal IronPython support. You should be able to run IronPython programs under `coverage run`, though you will still have to do the reporting phase with CPython.
  - Coverage.py has long had a special hack to support CPython's need to measure the coverage of the standard library tests. This code was not installed by kitted versions of coverage.py. Now it is.

## Version 4.3.4 — 2017-01-17

  - Fixing 2.6 in version 4.3.3 broke other things, because the too-tricky exception wasn't properly derived from Exception, described in [issue 556](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/556). A newb mistake; it hasn't been a good few days.

## Version 4.3.3 — 2017-01-17

  - Python 2.6 support was broken due to a testing exception imported for the benefit of the coverage.py test suite. Properly conditionalizing it fixed [issue 554](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/554) so that Python 2.6 works again.

## Version 4.3.2 — 2017-01-16

  - Using the `--skip-covered` option on an HTML report with 100% coverage would cause a "No data to report" error, as reported in [issue 549](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/549). This is now fixed; thanks, Loïc Dachary.
  - If-statements can be optimized away during compilation, for example, `if 0:` or `if __debug__:`. Coverage.py had problems properly understanding these statements which existed in the source, but not in the compiled bytecode. This problem, reported in [issue 522](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/522), is now fixed.
  - If you specified `--source` as a directory, then coverage.py would look for importable Python files in that directory, and could identify ones that had never been executed at all. But if you specified it as a package name, that detection wasn't performed. Now it is, closing [issue 426](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/426). Thanks to Loïc Dachary for the fix.
  - If you started and stopped coverage measurement thousands of times in your process, you could crash Python with a "Fatal Python error: deallocating None" error. This is now fixed. Thanks to Alex Groce for the bug report.
  - On PyPy, measuring coverage in subprocesses could produce a warning: "Trace function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None". This was spurious, and has been suppressed.
  - Previously, coverage.py couldn't start on Jython, due to that implementation missing the multiprocessing module ([issue 551](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/551)). This problem has now been fixed. Also, [issue 322](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/322) about not being able to invoke coverage conveniently, seems much better: `jython -m coverage run myprog.py` works properly.
  - Let's say you ran the HTML report over and over again in the same output directory, with `--skip-covered`. And imagine due to your heroic test-writing efforts, a file just achieved the goal of 100% coverage. With coverage.py 4.3, the old HTML file with the less-than-100% coverage would be left behind. This file is now properly deleted.

## Version 4.3.1 — 2016-12-28

  - Some environments couldn't install 4.3, as described in [issue 540](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/540). This is now fixed.
  - The check for conflicting `--source` and `--include` was too simple in a few different ways, breaking a few perfectly reasonable use cases, described in [issue 541](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/541). The check has been reverted while we re-think the fix for [issue 265](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/265).

## Version 4.3 — 2016-12-27

Special thanks to **Loïc Dachary**, who took an extraordinary interest in coverage.py and contributed a number of improvements in this release.

  - Subprocesses that are measured with [automatic subprocess measurement](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess.html) used to read in any pre-existing data file. This meant data would be incorrectly carried forward from run to run. Now those files are not read, so each subprocess only writes its own data. Fixes [issue 510](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/510).
  - The `coverage combine` command will now fail if there are no data files to combine. The combine changes in 4.2 meant that multiple combines could lose data, leaving you with an empty .coverage data file. Fixes [issue 525](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/525), [issue 412](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/412), [issue 516](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/516), and probably [issue 511](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/511).
  - Coverage.py wouldn't execute [sys.excepthook](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.excepthook) when an exception happened in your program. Now it does, thanks to Andrew Hoos. Closes [issue 535](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/535).
  - Branch coverage fixes:
      - Branch coverage could misunderstand a finally clause on a try block that never continued on to the following statement, as described in [issue 493](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/493). This is now fixed. Thanks to Joe Doherty for the report and Loïc Dachary for the fix.
      - A while loop with a constant condition (while True) and a continue statement would be mis-analyzed, as described in [issue 496](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/496). This is now fixed, thanks to a bug report by Eli Skeggs and a fix by Loïc Dachary.
      - While loops with constant conditions that were never executed could result in a non-zero coverage report. Artem Dayneko reported this in [issue 502](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/502), and Loïc Dachary provided the fix.
  - The HTML report now supports a `--skip-covered` option like the other reporting commands. Thanks, Loïc Dachary for the implementation, closing [issue 433](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/433).
  - Options can now be read from a tox.ini file, if any. Like setup.cfg, sections are prefixed with "coverage:", so `[run]` options will be read from the `[coverage:run]` section of tox.ini. Implements part of [issue 519](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/519). Thanks, Stephen Finucane.
  - Specifying both `--source` and `--include` no longer silently ignores the include setting, instead it fails with a message. Thanks, Nathan Land and Loïc Dachary. Closes [issue 265](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/265).
  - The `Coverage.combine` method has a new parameter, `strict=False`, to support failing if there are no data files to combine.
  - When forking subprocesses, the coverage data files would have the same random number appended to the file name. This didn't cause problems, because the file names had the process id also, making collisions (nearly) impossible. But it was disconcerting. This is now fixed.
  - The text report now properly sizes headers when skipping some files, fixing [issue 524](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/524). Thanks, Anthony Sottile and Loïc Dachary.
  - Coverage.py can now search .pex files for source, just as it can .zip and .egg. Thanks, Peter Ebden.
  - Data files are now about 15% smaller.
  - Improvements in the `[run] debug` setting:
      - The "dataio" debug setting now also logs when data files are deleted during combining or erasing.
      - A new debug option, "multiproc", for logging the behavior of `concurrency=multiprocessing`.
      - If you used the debug options "config" and "callers" together, you'd get a call stack printed for every line in the multi-line config output. This is now fixed.
  - Fixed an unusual bug involving multiple coding declarations affecting code containing code in multi-line strings: [issue 529](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/529).
  - Coverage.py will no longer be misled into thinking that a plain file is a package when interpreting `--source` options. Thanks, Cosimo Lupo.
  - If you try to run a non-Python file with coverage.py, you will now get a more useful error message. [Issue 514](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/514).
  - The default pragma regex changed slightly, but this will only matter to you if you are deranged and use mixed-case pragmas.
  - Deal properly with non-ASCII file names in an ASCII-only world, [issue 533](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/533).
  - Programs that set Unicode configuration values could cause UnicodeErrors when generating HTML reports. Pytest-cov is one example. This is now fixed.
  - Prevented deprecation warnings from configparser that happened in some circumstances, closing [issue 530](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/530).
  - Corrected the name of the jquery.ba-throttle-debounce.js library. Thanks, Ben Finney. Closes [issue 505](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/505).
  - Testing against PyPy 5.6 and PyPy3 5.5.
  - Switched to pytest from nose for running the coverage.py tests.
  - Renamed AUTHORS.txt to CONTRIBUTORS.txt, since there are other ways to contribute than by writing code. Also put the count of contributors into the author string in setup.py, though this might be too cute.

## Version 4.2 — 2016-07-26

  - Since `concurrency=multiprocessing` uses subprocesses, options specified on the coverage.py command line will not be communicated down to them. Only options in the configuration file will apply to the subprocesses. Previously, the options didn't apply to the subprocesses, but there was no indication. Now it is an error to use `--concurrency=multiprocessing` and other run-affecting options on the command line. This prevents failures like those reported in [issue 495](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/495).
  - Filtering the HTML report is now faster, thanks to Ville Skyttä.

## Version 4.2b1 — 2016-07-04

Work from the PyCon 2016 Sprints\!

  - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the `coverage combine` command now ignores an existing `.coverage` data file. It used to include that file in its combining. This caused confusing results, and extra tox "clean" steps. If you want the old behavior, use the new `coverage combine --append` option.
  - The `concurrency` option can now take multiple values, to support programs using multiprocessing and another library such as eventlet. This is only possible in the configuration file, not from the command line. The configuration file is the only way for sub-processes to all run with the same options. Fixes [issue 484](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/484). Thanks to Josh Williams for prototyping.
  - Using a `concurrency` setting of `multiprocessing` now implies `--parallel` so that the main program is measured similarly to the sub-processes.
  - When using [automatic subprocess measurement](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess.html), running coverage commands would create spurious data files. This is now fixed, thanks to diagnosis and testing by Dan Riti. Closes [issue 492](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/492).
  - A new configuration option, `report:sort`, controls what column of the text report is used to sort the rows. Thanks to Dan Wandschneider, this closes [issue 199](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/199).
  - The HTML report has a more-visible indicator for which column is being sorted. Closes [issue 298](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/298), thanks to Josh Williams.
  - If the HTML report cannot find the source for a file, the message now suggests using the `-i` flag to allow the report to continue. Closes [issue 231](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/231), thanks, Nathan Land.
  - When reports are ignoring errors, there's now a warning if a file cannot be parsed, rather than being silently ignored. Closes [issue 396](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/396). Thanks, Matthew Boehm.
  - A new option for `coverage debug` is available: `coverage debug config` shows the current configuration. Closes [issue 454](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/454), thanks to Matthew Boehm.
  - Running coverage as a module (`python -m coverage`) no longer shows the program name as `__main__.py`. Fixes [issue 478](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/478). Thanks, Scott Belden.
  - The <span class="title-ref">test\_helpers</span> module has been moved into a separate pip-installable package: [unittest-mixins](https://pypi.org/project/unittest-mixins/).

## Version 4.1 — 2016-05-21

  - The internal attribute <span class="title-ref">Reporter.file\_reporters</span> was removed in 4.1b3. It should have come has no surprise that there were third-party tools out there using that attribute. It has been restored, but with a deprecation warning.

## Version 4.1b3 — 2016-05-10

  - When running your program, execution can jump from an `except X:` line to some other line when an exception other than `X` happens. This jump is no longer considered a branch when measuring branch coverage.
  - When measuring branch coverage, `yield` statements that were never resumed were incorrectly marked as missing, as reported in [issue 440](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/440). This is now fixed.
  - During branch coverage of single-line callables like lambdas and generator expressions, coverage.py can now distinguish between them never being called, or being called but not completed. Fixes [issue 90](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/90), [issue 460](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/460) and [issue 475](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/475).
  - The HTML report now has a map of the file along the rightmost edge of the page, giving an overview of where the missed lines are. Thanks, Dmitry Shishov.
  - The HTML report now uses different monospaced fonts, favoring Consolas over Courier. Along the way, [issue 472](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/472) about not properly handling one-space indents was fixed. The index page also has slightly different styling, to try to make the clickable detail pages more apparent.
  - Missing branches reported with `coverage report -m` will now say `->exit` for missed branches to the exit of a function, rather than a negative number. Fixes [issue 469](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/469).
  - `coverage --help` and `coverage --version` now mention which tracer is installed, to help diagnose problems. The docs mention which features need the C extension. ([issue 479](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/479))
  - Officially support PyPy 5.1, which required no changes, just updates to the docs.
  - The <span class="title-ref">Coverage.report</span> function had two parameters with non-None defaults, which have been changed. <span class="title-ref">show\_missing</span> used to default to True, but now defaults to None. If you had been calling <span class="title-ref">Coverage.report</span> without specifying <span class="title-ref">show\_missing</span>, you'll need to explicitly set it to True to keep the same behavior. <span class="title-ref">skip\_covered</span> used to default to False. It is now None, which doesn't change the behavior. This fixes [issue 485](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/485).
  - It's never been possible to pass a namespace module to one of the analysis functions, but now at least we raise a more specific error message, rather than getting confused. ([issue 456](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/456))
  - The <span class="title-ref">coverage.process\_startup</span> function now returns the <span class="title-ref">Coverage</span> instance it creates, as suggested in [issue 481](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/481).
  - Make a small tweak to how we compare threads, to avoid buggy custom comparison code in thread classes. ([issue 245](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/245))

## Version 4.1b2 — 2016-01-23

  - Problems with the new branch measurement in 4.1 beta 1 were fixed:
      - Class docstrings were considered executable. Now they no longer are.
      - `yield from` and `await` were considered returns from functions, since they could transfer control to the caller. This produced unhelpful "missing branch" reports in a number of circumstances. Now they no longer are considered returns.
      - In unusual situations, a missing branch to a negative number was reported. This has been fixed, closing [issue 466](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/466).
  - The XML report now produces correct package names for modules found in directories specified with `source=`. Fixes [issue 465](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/465).
  - `coverage report` won't produce trailing white space.

## Version 4.1b1 — 2016-01-10

  - Branch analysis has been rewritten: it used to be based on bytecode, but now uses AST analysis. This has changed a number of things:
      - More code paths are now considered runnable, especially in `try`/`except` structures. This may mean that coverage.py will identify more code paths as uncovered. This could either raise or lower your overall coverage number.
      - Python 3.5's `async` and `await` keywords are properly supported, fixing [issue 434](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/434).
      - Some long-standing branch coverage bugs were fixed:
          - [issue 129](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/129): functions with only a docstring for a body would incorrectly report a missing branch on the `def` line.
          - [issue 212](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/212): code in an `except` block could be incorrectly marked as a missing branch.
          - [issue 146](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/146): context managers (`with` statements) in a loop or `try` block could confuse the branch measurement, reporting incorrect partial branches.
          - [issue 422](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/422): in Python 3.5, an actual partial branch could be marked as complete.
  - Pragmas to disable coverage measurement can now be used on decorator lines, and they will apply to the entire function or class being decorated. This implements the feature requested in [issue 131](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/131).
  - Multiprocessing support is now available on Windows. Thanks, Rodrigue Cloutier.
  - Files with two encoding declarations are properly supported, fixing [issue 453](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/453). Thanks, Max Linke.
  - Non-ascii characters in regexes in the configuration file worked in 3.7, but stopped working in 4.0. Now they work again, closing [issue 455](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/455).
  - Form-feed characters would prevent accurate determination of the beginning of statements in the rest of the file. This is now fixed, closing [issue 461](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/461).

## Version 4.0.3 — 2015-11-24

  - Fixed a mysterious problem that manifested in different ways: sometimes hanging the process ([issue 420](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/420)), sometimes making database connections fail ([issue 445](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/445)).
  - The XML report now has correct `<source>` elements when using a `--source=` option somewhere besides the current directory. This fixes [issue 439](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/439). Thanks, Arcadiy Ivanov.
  - Fixed an unusual edge case of detecting source encodings, described in [issue 443](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/443).
  - Help messages that mention the command to use now properly use the actual command name, which might be different than "coverage". Thanks to Ben Finney, this closes [issue 438](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/438).

## Version 4.0.2 — 2015-11-04

  - More work on supporting unusually encoded source. Fixed [issue 431](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/431).
  - Files or directories with non-ASCII characters are now handled properly, fixing [issue 432](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/432).
  - Setting a trace function with sys.settrace was broken by a change in 4.0.1, as reported in [issue 436](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/436). This is now fixed.
  - Officially support PyPy 4.0, which required no changes, just updates to the docs.

## Version 4.0.1 — 2015-10-13

  - When combining data files, unreadable files will now generate a warning instead of failing the command. This is more in line with the older coverage.py v3.7.1 behavior, which silently ignored unreadable files. Prompted by [issue 418](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/418).
  - The --skip-covered option would skip reporting on 100% covered files, but also skipped them when calculating total coverage. This was wrong, it should only remove lines from the report, not change the final answer. This is now fixed, closing [issue 423](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/423).
  - In 4.0, the data file recorded a summary of the system on which it was run. Combined data files would keep all of those summaries. This could lead to enormous data files consisting of mostly repetitive useless information. That summary is now gone, fixing [issue 415](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/415). If you want summary information, get in touch, and we'll figure out a better way to do it.
  - Test suites that mocked os.path.exists would experience strange failures, due to coverage.py using their mock inadvertently. This is now fixed, closing [issue 416](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/416).
  - Importing a `__init__` module explicitly would lead to an error: `AttributeError: 'module' object has no attribute '__path__'`, as reported in [issue 410](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/410). This is now fixed.
  - Code that uses `sys.settrace(sys.gettrace())` used to incur a more than 2x speed penalty. Now there's no penalty at all. Fixes [issue 397](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/397).
  - Pyexpat C code will no longer be recorded as a source file, fixing [issue 419](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/419).
  - The source kit now contains all of the files needed to have a complete source tree, re-fixing [issue 137](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/137) and closing [issue 281](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/281).

## Version 4.0 — 2015-09-20

No changes from 4.0b3

## Version 4.0b3 — 2015-09-07

  - Reporting on an unmeasured file would fail with a traceback. This is now fixed, closing [issue 403](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/403).
  - The Jenkins [ShiningPanda](https://plugins.jenkins.io/shiningpanda/) plugin looks for an obsolete file name to find the HTML reports to publish, so it was failing under coverage.py 4.0. Now we create that file if we are running under Jenkins, to keep things working smoothly. [issue 404](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/404).
  - Kits used to include tests and docs, but didn't install them anywhere, or provide all of the supporting tools to make them useful. Kits no longer include tests and docs. If you were using them from the older packages, get in touch and help me understand how.

## Version 4.0b2 — 2015-08-22

  - 4.0b1 broke `--append` creating new data files. This is now fixed, closing [issue 392](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/392).
  - `py.test --cov` can write empty data, then touch files due to `--source`, which made coverage.py mistakenly force the data file to record lines instead of arcs. This would lead to a "Can't combine line data with arc data" error message. This is now fixed, and changed some method names in the CoverageData interface. Fixes [issue 399](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/399).
  - <span class="title-ref">CoverageData.read\_fileobj</span> and <span class="title-ref">CoverageData.write\_fileobj</span> replace the <span class="title-ref">.read</span> and <span class="title-ref">.write</span> methods, and are now properly inverses of each other.
  - When using `report --skip-covered`, a message will now be included in the report output indicating how many files were skipped, and if all files are skipped, coverage.py won't accidentally scold you for having no data to report. Thanks, Krystian Kichewko.
  - A new conversion utility has been added: `python -m coverage.pickle2json` will convert v3.x pickle data files to v4.x JSON data files. Thanks, Alexander Todorov. Closes [issue 395](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/395).
  - A new version identifier is available, <span class="title-ref">coverage.version\_info</span>, a plain tuple of values similar to [sys.version\_info](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.version_info).

## Version 4.0b1 — 2015-08-02

  - Coverage.py is now licensed under the Apache 2.0 license. See NOTICE.txt for details. Closes [issue 313](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/313).
  - The data storage has been completely revamped. The data file is now JSON-based instead of a pickle, closing [issue 236](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/236). The <span class="title-ref">CoverageData</span> class is now a public supported documented API to the data file.
  - A new configuration option, `[run] note`, lets you set a note that will be stored in the <span class="title-ref">runs</span> section of the data file. You can use this to annotate the data file with any information you like.
  - Unrecognized configuration options will now print an error message and stop coverage.py. This should help prevent configuration mistakes from passing silently. Finishes [issue 386](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/386).
  - In parallel mode, `coverage erase` will now delete all of the data files, fixing [issue 262](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/262).
  - Coverage.py now accepts a directory name for `coverage run` and will run a `__main__.py` found there, just like Python will. Fixes [issue 252](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/252). Thanks, Dmitry Trofimov.
  - The XML report now includes a `missing-branches` attribute. Thanks, Steve Peak. This is not a part of the Cobertura DTD, so the XML report no longer references the DTD.
  - Missing branches in the HTML report now have a bit more information in the right-hand annotations. Hopefully this will make their meaning clearer.
  - All the reporting functions now behave the same if no data had been collected, exiting with a status code of 1. Fixed `fail_under` to be applied even when the report is empty. Thanks, Ionel Cristian Mărieș.
  - Plugins are now initialized differently. Instead of looking for a class called `Plugin`, coverage.py looks for a function called `coverage_init`.
  - A file-tracing plugin can now ask to have built-in Python reporting by returning <span class="title-ref">"python"</span> from its <span class="title-ref">file\_reporter()</span> method.
  - Code that was executed with <span class="title-ref">exec</span> would be mis-attributed to the file that called it. This is now fixed, closing [issue 380](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/380).
  - The ability to use item access on <span class="title-ref">Coverage.config</span> (introduced in 4.0a2) has been changed to a more explicit <span class="title-ref">Coverage.get\_option</span> and <span class="title-ref">Coverage.set\_option</span> API.
  - The `Coverage.use_cache` method is no longer supported.
  - The private method `Coverage._harvest_data` is now called `Coverage.get_data`, and returns the `CoverageData` containing the collected data.
  - The project is consistently referred to as "coverage.py" throughout the code and the documentation, closing [issue 275](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/275).
  - Combining data files with an explicit configuration file was broken in 4.0a6, but now works again, closing [issue 385](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/385).
  - `coverage combine` now accepts files as well as directories.
  - The speed is back to 3.7.1 levels, after having slowed down due to plugin support, finishing up [issue 387](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/387).

## Version 4.0a6 — 2015-06-21

  - Python 3.5b2 and PyPy 2.6.0 are supported.
  - The original module-level function interface to coverage.py is no longer supported. You must now create a `coverage.Coverage` object, and use methods on it.
  - The `coverage combine` command now accepts any number of directories as arguments, and will combine all the data files from those directories. This means you don't have to copy the files to one directory before combining. Thanks, Christine Lytwynec. Finishes [issue 354](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/354).
  - Branch coverage couldn't properly handle certain extremely long files. This is now fixed ([issue 359](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/359)).
  - Branch coverage didn't understand yield statements properly. Mickie Betz persisted in pursuing this despite Ned's pessimism. Fixes [issue 308](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/308) and [issue 324](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/324).
  - The `COVERAGE_DEBUG` environment variable can be used to set the `[run] debug` configuration option to control what internal operations are logged.
  - HTML reports were truncated at formfeed characters. This is now fixed ([issue 360](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/360)). It's always fun when the problem is due to a [bug in the Python standard library](http://bugs.python.org/issue19035).
  - Files with incorrect encoding declaration comments are no longer ignored by the reporting commands, fixing [issue 351](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/351).
  - HTML reports now include a time stamp in the footer, closing [issue 299](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/299). Thanks, Conrad Ho.
  - HTML reports now begrudgingly use double-quotes rather than single quotes, because there are "software engineers" out there writing tools that read HTML and somehow have no idea that single quotes exist. Capitulates to the absurd [issue 361](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/361). Thanks, Jon Chappell.
  - The `coverage annotate` command now handles non-ASCII characters properly, closing [issue 363](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/363). Thanks, Leonardo Pistone.
  - Drive letters on Windows were not normalized correctly, now they are. Thanks, Ionel Cristian Mărieș.
  - Plugin support had some bugs fixed, closing [issue 374](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/374) and [issue 375](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/375). Thanks, Stefan Behnel.

## Version 4.0a5 — 2015-02-16

  - Plugin support is now implemented in the C tracer instead of the Python tracer. This greatly improves the speed of tracing projects using plugins.
  - Coverage.py now always adds the current directory to sys.path, so that plugins can import files in the current directory ([issue 358](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/358)).
  - If the <span class="title-ref">config\_file</span> argument to the Coverage constructor is specified as ".coveragerc", it is treated as if it were True. This means setup.cfg is also examined, and a missing file is not considered an error ([issue 357](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/357)).
  - Wildly experimental: support for measuring processes started by the multiprocessing module. To use, set `--concurrency=multiprocessing`, either on the command line or in the .coveragerc file ([issue 117](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/117)). Thanks, Eduardo Schettino. Currently, this does not work on Windows.
  - A new warning is possible, if a desired file isn't measured because it was imported before coverage.py was started ([issue 353](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/353)).
  - The <span class="title-ref">coverage.process\_startup</span> function now will start coverage measurement only once, no matter how many times it is called. This fixes problems due to unusual virtualenv configurations ([issue 340](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/340)).
  - Added 3.5.0a1 to the list of supported CPython versions.

## Version 4.0a4 — 2015-01-25

  - Plugins can now provide sys\_info for debugging output.
  - Started plugins documentation.
  - Prepared to move the docs to readthedocs.org.

## Version 4.0a3 — 2015-01-20

  - Reports now use file names with extensions. Previously, a report would describe a/b/c.py as "a/b/c". Now it is shown as "a/b/c.py". This allows for better support of non-Python files, and also fixed [issue 69](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/69).
  - The XML report now reports each directory as a package again. This was a bad regression, I apologize. This was reported in [issue 235](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/235), which is now fixed.
  - A new configuration option for the XML report: `[xml] package_depth` controls which directories are identified as packages in the report. Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages. The default is that all directories are reported as packages. Thanks, Lex Berezhny.
  - When looking for the source for a frame, check if the file exists. On Windows, .pyw files are no longer recorded as .py files. Along the way, this fixed [issue 290](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/290).
  - Empty files are now reported as 100% covered in the XML report, not 0% covered ([issue 345](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/345)).
  - Regexes in the configuration file are now compiled as soon as they are read, to provide error messages earlier ([issue 349](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/349)).

## Version 4.0a2 — 2015-01-14

  - Officially support PyPy 2.4, and PyPy3 2.4. Drop support for CPython 3.2 and older versions of PyPy. The code won't work on CPython 3.2. It will probably still work on older versions of PyPy, but I'm not testing against them.
  - Plugins\!
  - The original command line switches (<span class="title-ref">-x</span> to run a program, etc) are no longer supported.
  - A new option: <span class="title-ref">coverage report --skip-covered</span> will reduce the number of files reported by skipping files with 100% coverage. Thanks, Krystian Kichewko. This means that empty <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span> files will be skipped, since they are 100% covered, closing [issue 315](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/315).
  - You can now specify the `--fail-under` option in the `.coveragerc` file as the `[report] fail_under` option. This closes [issue 314](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/314).
  - The `COVERAGE_OPTIONS` environment variable is no longer supported. It was a hack for `--timid` before configuration files were available.
  - The HTML report now has filtering. Type text into the Filter box on the index page, and only modules with that text in the name will be shown. Thanks, Danny Allen.
  - The textual report and the HTML report used to report partial branches differently for no good reason. Now the text report's "missing branches" column is a "partial branches" column so that both reports show the same numbers. This closes [issue 342](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/342).
  - If you specify a `--rcfile` that cannot be read, you will get an error message. Fixes [issue 343](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/343).
  - The `--debug` switch can now be used on any command.
  - You can now programmatically adjust the configuration of coverage.py by setting items on <span class="title-ref">Coverage.config</span> after construction.
  - A module run with `-m` can be used as the argument to `--source`, fixing [issue 328](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/328). Thanks, Buck Evan.
  - The regex for matching exclusion pragmas has been fixed to allow more kinds of white space, fixing [issue 334](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/334).
  - Made some PyPy-specific tweaks to improve speed under PyPy. Thanks, Alex Gaynor.
  - In some cases, with a source file missing a final newline, coverage.py would count statements incorrectly. This is now fixed, closing [issue 293](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/293).
  - The status.dat file that HTML reports use to avoid re-creating files that haven't changed is now a JSON file instead of a pickle file. This obviates [issue 287](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/287) and [issue 237](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/237).

## Version 4.0a1 — 2014-09-27

  - Python versions supported are now CPython 2.6, 2.7, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, and PyPy 2.2.
  - Gevent, eventlet, and greenlet are now supported, closing [issue 149](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/149). The `concurrency` setting specifies the concurrency library in use. Huge thanks to Peter Portante for initial implementation, and to Joe Jevnik for the final insight that completed the work.
  - Options are now also read from a setup.cfg file, if any. Sections are prefixed with "coverage:", so the `[run]` options will be read from the `[coverage:run]` section of setup.cfg. Finishes [issue 304](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/304).
  - The `report -m` command can now show missing branches when reporting on branch coverage. Thanks, Steve Leonard. Closes [issue 230](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/230).
  - The XML report now contains a \<source\> element, fixing [issue 94](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/94). Thanks Stan Hu.
  - The class defined in the coverage module is now called `Coverage` instead of `coverage`, though the old name still works, for backward compatibility.
  - The `fail-under` value is now rounded the same as reported results, preventing paradoxical results, fixing [issue 284](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/284).
  - The XML report will now create the output directory if need be, fixing [issue 285](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/285). Thanks, Chris Rose.
  - HTML reports no longer raise UnicodeDecodeError if a Python file has un-decodable characters, fixing [issue 303](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/303) and [issue 331](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/331).
  - The annotate command will now annotate all files, not just ones relative to the current directory, fixing [issue 57](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/57).
  - The coverage module no longer causes deprecation warnings on Python 3.4 by importing the imp module, fixing [issue 305](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/305).
  - Encoding declarations in source files are only considered if they are truly comments. Thanks, Anthony Sottile.

## Version 3.7.1 — 2013-12-13

  - Improved the speed of HTML report generation by about 20%.
  - Fixed the mechanism for finding OS-installed static files for the HTML report so that it will actually find OS-installed static files.

## Version 3.7 — 2013-10-06

  - Added the `--debug` switch to `coverage run`. It accepts a list of options indicating the type of internal activity to log to stderr.
  - Improved the branch coverage facility, fixing [issue 92](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/92) and [issue 175](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/175).
  - Running code with `coverage run -m` now behaves more like Python does, setting sys.path properly, which fixes [issue 207](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/207) and [issue 242](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/242).
  - Coverage.py can now run .pyc files directly, closing [issue 264](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/264).
  - Coverage.py properly supports .pyw files, fixing [issue 261](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/261).
  - Omitting files within a tree specified with the `source` option would cause them to be incorrectly marked as un-executed, as described in [issue 218](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/218). This is now fixed.
  - When specifying paths to alias together during data combining, you can now specify relative paths, fixing [issue 267](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/267).
  - Most file paths can now be specified with username expansion (`~/src`, or `~build/src`, for example), and with environment variable expansion (`build/$BUILDNUM/src`).
  - Trying to create an XML report with no files to report on, would cause a ZeroDivisionError, but no longer does, fixing [issue 250](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/250).
  - When running a threaded program under the Python tracer, coverage.py no longer issues a spurious warning about the trace function changing: "Trace function changed, measurement is likely wrong: None." This fixes [issue 164](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/164).
  - Static files necessary for HTML reports are found in system-installed places, to ease OS-level packaging of coverage.py. Closes [issue 259](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/259).
  - Source files with encoding declarations, but a blank first line, were not decoded properly. Now they are. Thanks, Roger Hu.
  - The source kit now includes the `__main__.py` file in the root coverage directory, fixing [issue 255](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/255).

## Version 3.6 — 2013-01-05

  - Added a page to the docs about troublesome situations, closing [issue 226](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/226), and added some info to the TODO file, closing [issue 227](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/227).

## Version 3.6b3 — 2012-12-29

  - Beta 2 broke the nose plugin. It's fixed again, closing [issue 224](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/224).

## Version 3.6b2 — 2012-12-23

  - Coverage.py runs on Python 2.3 and 2.4 again. It was broken in 3.6b1.
  - The C extension is optionally compiled using a different more widely-used technique, taking another stab at fixing [issue 80](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/80) once and for all.
  - Combining data files would create entries for phantom files if used with `source` and path aliases. It no longer does.
  - `debug sys` now shows the configuration file path that was read.
  - If an oddly-behaved package claims that code came from an empty-string file name, coverage.py no longer associates it with the directory name, fixing [issue 221](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/221).

## Version 3.6b1 — 2012-11-28

  - Wildcards in `include=` and `omit=` arguments were not handled properly in reporting functions, though they were when running. Now they are handled uniformly, closing [issue 143](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/143) and [issue 163](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/163). **NOTE**: it is possible that your configurations may now be incorrect. If you use `include` or `omit` during reporting, whether on the command line, through the API, or in a configuration file, please check carefully that you were not relying on the old broken behavior.
  - The **report**, **html**, and **xml** commands now accept a `--fail-under` switch that indicates in the exit status whether the coverage percentage was less than a particular value. Closes [issue 139](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/139).
  - The reporting functions coverage.report(), coverage.html\_report(), and coverage.xml\_report() now all return a float, the total percentage covered measurement.
  - The HTML report's title can now be set in the configuration file, with the `--title` switch on the command line, or via the API.
  - Configuration files now support substitution of environment variables, using syntax like `${WORD}`. Closes [issue 97](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/97).
  - Embarrassingly, the `[xml] output=` setting in the .coveragerc file simply didn't work. Now it does.
  - The XML report now consistently uses file names for the file name attribute, rather than sometimes using module names. Fixes [issue 67](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/67). Thanks, Marcus Cobden.
  - Coverage percentage metrics are now computed slightly differently under branch coverage. This means that completely un-executed files will now correctly have 0% coverage, fixing [issue 156](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/156). This also means that your total coverage numbers will generally now be lower if you are measuring branch coverage.
  - When installing, now in addition to creating a "coverage" command, two new aliases are also installed. A "coverage2" or "coverage3" command will be created, depending on whether you are installing in Python 2.x or 3.x. A "coverage-X.Y" command will also be created corresponding to your specific version of Python. Closes [issue 111](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/111).
  - The coverage.py installer no longer tries to bootstrap setuptools or Distribute. You must have one of them installed first, as [issue 202](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/202) recommended.
  - The coverage.py kit now includes docs (closing [issue 137](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/137)) and tests.
  - On Windows, files are now reported in their correct case, fixing [issue 89](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/89) and [issue 203](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/203).
  - If a file is missing during reporting, the path shown in the error message is now correct, rather than an incorrect path in the current directory. Fixes [issue 60](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/60).
  - Running an HTML report in Python 3 in the same directory as an old Python 2 HTML report would fail with a UnicodeDecodeError. This issue ([issue 193](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/193)) is now fixed.
  - Fixed yet another error trying to parse non-Python files as Python, this time an IndentationError, closing [issue 82](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/82) for the fourth time...
  - If <span class="title-ref">coverage xml</span> fails because there is no data to report, it used to create a zero-length XML file. Now it doesn't, fixing [issue 210](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/210).
  - Jython files now work with the `--source` option, fixing [issue 100](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/100).
  - Running coverage.py under a debugger is unlikely to work, but it shouldn't fail with "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not iterable". Fixes [issue 201](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/201).
  - On some Linux distributions, when installed with the OS package manager, coverage.py would report its own code as part of the results. Now it won't, fixing [issue 214](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/214), though this will take some time to be repackaged by the operating systems.
  - Docstrings for the legacy singleton methods are more helpful. Thanks Marius Gedminas. Closes [issue 205](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/205).
  - The pydoc tool can now show documentation for the class <span class="title-ref">coverage.coverage</span>. Closes [issue 206](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/206).
  - Added a page to the docs about contributing to coverage.py, closing [issue 171](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/171).
  - When coverage.py ended unsuccessfully, it may have reported odd errors like `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'isabs'`. It no longer does, so kiss [issue 153](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/153) goodbye.

## Version 3.5.3 — 2012-09-29

  - Line numbers in the HTML report line up better with the source lines, fixing [issue 197](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/197), thanks Marius Gedminas.
  - When specifying a directory as the source= option, the directory itself no longer needs to have a `__init__.py` file, though its sub-directories do, to be considered as source files.
  - Files encoded as UTF-8 with a BOM are now properly handled, fixing [issue 179](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/179). Thanks, Pablo Carballo.
  - Fixed more cases of non-Python files being reported as Python source, and then not being able to parse them as Python. Closes [issue 82](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/82) (again). Thanks, Julian Berman.
  - Fixed memory leaks under Python 3, thanks, Brett Cannon. Closes [issue 147](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/147).
  - Optimized .pyo files may not have been handled correctly, [issue 195](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/195). Thanks, Marius Gedminas.
  - Certain unusually named file paths could have been mangled during reporting, [issue 194](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/194). Thanks, Marius Gedminas.
  - Try to do a better job of the impossible task of detecting when we can't build the C extension, fixing [issue 183](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/183).
  - Testing is now done with [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/), thanks, Marc Abramowitz.

## Version 3.5.2 — 2012-05-04

No changes since 3.5.2.b1

## Version 3.5.2b1 — 2012-04-29

  - The HTML report has slightly tweaked controls: the buttons at the top of the page are color-coded to the source lines they affect.
  - Custom CSS can be applied to the HTML report by specifying a CSS file as the `extra_css` configuration value in the `[html]` section.
  - Source files with custom encodings declared in a comment at the top are now properly handled during reporting on Python 2. Python 3 always handled them properly. This fixes [issue 157](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/157).
  - Backup files left behind by editors are no longer collected by the source= option, fixing [issue 168](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/168).
  - If a file doesn't parse properly as Python, we don't report it as an error if the file name seems like maybe it wasn't meant to be Python. This is a pragmatic fix for [issue 82](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/82).
  - The `-m` switch on `coverage report`, which includes missing line numbers in the summary report, can now be specified as `show_missing` in the config file. Closes [issue 173](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/173).
  - When running a module with `coverage run -m <modulename>`, certain details of the execution environment weren't the same as for `python -m <modulename>`. This had the unfortunate side-effect of making `coverage run -m unittest discover` not work if you had tests in a directory named "test". This fixes [issue 155](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/155) and [issue 142](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/142).
  - Now the exit status of your product code is properly used as the process status when running `python -m coverage run ...`. Thanks, JT Olds.
  - When installing into PyPy, we no longer attempt (and fail) to compile the C tracer function, closing [issue 166](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/166).

## Version 3.5.1 — 2011-09-23

  - The `[paths]` feature unfortunately didn't work in real world situations where you wanted to, you know, report on the combined data. Now all paths stored in the combined file are canonicalized properly.

## Version 3.5.1b1 — 2011-08-28

  - When combining data files from parallel runs, you can now instruct coverage.py about which directories are equivalent on different machines. A `[paths]` section in the configuration file lists paths that are to be considered equivalent. Finishes [issue 17](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/17).
  - for-else constructs are understood better, and don't cause erroneous partial branch warnings. Fixes [issue 122](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/122).
  - Branch coverage for `with` statements is improved, fixing [issue 128](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/128).
  - The number of partial branches reported on the HTML summary page was different than the number reported on the individual file pages. This is now fixed.
  - An explicit include directive to measure files in the Python installation wouldn't work because of the standard library exclusion. Now the include directive takes precedence, and the files will be measured. Fixes [issue 138](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/138).
  - The HTML report now handles Unicode characters in Python source files properly. This fixes [issue 124](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/124) and [issue 144](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/144). Thanks, Devin Jeanpierre.
  - In order to help the core developers measure the test coverage of the standard library, Brandon Rhodes devised an aggressive hack to trick Python into running some coverage.py code before anything else in the process. See the coverage/fullcoverage directory if you are interested.

## Version 3.5 — 2011-06-29

  - The HTML report hotkeys now behave slightly differently when the current chunk isn't visible at all: a chunk on the screen will be selected, instead of the old behavior of jumping to the literal next chunk. The hotkeys now work in Google Chrome. Thanks, Guido van Rossum.

## Version 3.5b1 — 2011-06-05

  - The HTML report now has hotkeys. Try `n`, `s`, `m`, `x`, `b`, `p`, and `c` on the overview page to change the column sorting. On a file page, `r`, `m`, `x`, and `p` toggle the run, missing, excluded, and partial line markings. You can navigate the highlighted sections of code by using the `j` and `k` keys for next and previous. The `1` (one) key jumps to the first highlighted section in the file, and `0` (zero) scrolls to the top of the file.
  - The `--omit` and `--include` switches now interpret their values more usefully. If the value starts with a wildcard character, it is used as-is. If it does not, it is interpreted relative to the current directory. Closes [issue 121](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/121).
  - Partial branch warnings can now be pragma'd away. The configuration option `partial_branches` is a list of regular expressions. Lines matching any of those expressions will never be marked as a partial branch. In addition, there's a built-in list of regular expressions marking statements which should never be marked as partial. This list includes `while True:`, `while 1:`, `if 1:`, and `if 0:`.
  - The `coverage()` constructor accepts single strings for the `omit=` and `include=` arguments, adapting to a common error in programmatic use.
  - Modules can now be run directly using `coverage run -m modulename`, to mirror Python's `-m` flag. Closes [issue 95](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/95), thanks, Brandon Rhodes.
  - `coverage run` didn't emulate Python accurately in one small detail: the current directory inserted into `sys.path` was relative rather than absolute. This is now fixed.
  - HTML reporting is now incremental: a record is kept of the data that produced the HTML reports, and only files whose data has changed will be generated. This should make most HTML reporting faster.
  - Pathological code execution could disable the trace function behind our backs, leading to incorrect code measurement. Now if this happens, coverage.py will issue a warning, at least alerting you to the problem. Closes [issue 93](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/93). Thanks to Marius Gedminas for the idea.
  - The C-based trace function now behaves properly when saved and restored with `sys.gettrace()` and `sys.settrace()`. This fixes [issue 125](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/125) and [issue 123](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/123). Thanks, Devin Jeanpierre.
  - Source files are now opened with Python 3.2's `tokenize.open()` where possible, to get the best handling of Python source files with encodings. Closes [issue 107](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/107), thanks, Brett Cannon.
  - Syntax errors in supposed Python files can now be ignored during reporting with the `-i` switch just like other source errors. Closes [issue 115](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/115).
  - Installation from source now succeeds on machines without a C compiler, closing [issue 80](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/80).
  - Coverage.py can now be run directly from a working tree by specifying the directory name to python: `python coverage_py_working_dir run ...`. Thanks, Brett Cannon.
  - A little bit of Jython support: <span class="title-ref">coverage run</span> can now measure Jython execution by adapting when $py.class files are traced. Thanks, Adi Roiban. Jython still doesn't provide the Python libraries needed to make coverage reporting work, unfortunately.
  - Internally, files are now closed explicitly, fixing [issue 104](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/104). Thanks, Brett Cannon.

## Version 3.4 — 2010-09-19

  - The XML report is now sorted by package name, fixing [issue 88](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/88).
  - Programs that exited with `sys.exit()` with no argument weren't handled properly, producing a coverage.py stack trace. That is now fixed.

## Version 3.4b2 — 2010-09-06

  - Completely un-executed files can now be included in coverage results, reported as 0% covered. This only happens if the --source option is specified, since coverage.py needs guidance about where to look for source files.
  - The XML report output now properly includes a percentage for branch coverage, fixing [issue 65](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/65) and [issue 81](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/81).
  - Coverage percentages are now displayed uniformly across reporting methods. Previously, different reports could round percentages differently. Also, percentages are only reported as 0% or 100% if they are truly 0 or 100, and are rounded otherwise. Fixes [issue 41](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/41) and [issue 70](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/70).
  - The precision of reported coverage percentages can be set with the `[report] precision` config file setting. Completes [issue 16](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/16).
  - Threads derived from `threading.Thread` with an overridden <span class="title-ref">run</span> method would report no coverage for the <span class="title-ref">run</span> method. This is now fixed, closing [issue 85](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/85).

## Version 3.4b1 — 2010-08-21

  - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the `--omit` and `--include` switches now take file patterns rather than file prefixes, closing [issue 34](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/34) and [issue 36](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/36).
  - BACKWARD INCOMPATIBILITY: the <span class="title-ref">omit\_prefixes</span> argument is gone throughout coverage.py, replaced with <span class="title-ref">omit</span>, a list of file name patterns suitable for <span class="title-ref">fnmatch</span>. A parallel argument <span class="title-ref">include</span> controls what files are included.
  - The run command now has a `--source` switch, a list of directories or module names. If provided, coverage.py will only measure execution in those source files.
  - Various warnings are printed to stderr for problems encountered during data measurement: if a `--source` module has no Python source to measure, or is never encountered at all, or if no data is collected.
  - The reporting commands (report, annotate, html, and xml) now have an `--include` switch to restrict reporting to modules matching those file patterns, similar to the existing `--omit` switch. Thanks, Zooko.
  - The run command now supports `--include` and `--omit` to control what modules it measures. This can speed execution and reduce the amount of data during reporting. Thanks Zooko.
  - Since coverage.py 3.1, using the Python trace function has been slower than it needs to be. A cache of tracing decisions was broken, but has now been fixed.
  - Python 2.7 and 3.2 have introduced new opcodes that are now supported.
  - Python files with no statements, for example, empty `__init__.py` files, are now reported as having zero statements instead of one. Fixes [issue 1](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1).
  - Reports now have a column of missed line counts rather than executed line counts, since developers should focus on reducing the missed lines to zero, rather than increasing the executed lines to varying targets. Once suggested, this seemed blindingly obvious.
  - Line numbers in HTML source pages are clickable, linking directly to that line, which is highlighted on arrival. Added a link back to the index page at the bottom of each HTML page.
  - Programs that call `os.fork` will properly collect data from both the child and parent processes. Use `coverage run -p` to get two data files that can be combined with `coverage combine`. Fixes [issue 56](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/56).
  - Coverage.py is now runnable as a module: `python -m coverage`. Thanks, Brett Cannon.
  - When measuring code running in a virtualenv, most of the system library was being measured when it shouldn't have been. This is now fixed.
  - Doctest text files are no longer recorded in the coverage data, since they can't be reported anyway. Fixes [issue 52](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/52) and [issue 61](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/61).
  - Jinja HTML templates compile into Python code using the HTML file name, which confused coverage.py. Now these files are no longer traced, fixing [issue 82](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/82).
  - Source files can have more than one dot in them (foo.test.py), and will be treated properly while reporting. Fixes [issue 46](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/46).
  - Source files with DOS line endings are now properly tokenized for syntax coloring on non-DOS machines. Fixes [issue 53](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/53).
  - Unusual code structure that confused exits from methods with exits from classes is now properly analyzed. See [issue 62](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/62).
  - Asking for an HTML report with no files now shows a nice error message rather than a cryptic failure ('int' object is unsubscriptable). Fixes [issue 59](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/59).

## Version 3.3.1 — 2010-03-06

  - Using <span class="title-ref">parallel=True</span> in .coveragerc file prevented reporting, but now does not, fixing [issue 49](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/49).
  - When running your code with "coverage run", if you call <span class="title-ref">sys.exit()</span>, coverage.py will exit with that status code, fixing [issue 50](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/50).

## Version 3.3 — 2010-02-24

  - Settings are now read from a .coveragerc file. A specific file can be specified on the command line with --rcfile=FILE. The name of the file can be programmatically set with the <span class="title-ref">config\_file</span> argument to the coverage() constructor, or reading a config file can be disabled with <span class="title-ref">config\_file=False</span>.
  - Fixed a problem with nested loops having their branch possibilities mis-characterized: [issue 39](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/39).
  - Added coverage.process\_start to enable coverage measurement when Python starts.
  - Parallel data file names now have a random number appended to them in addition to the machine name and process id.
  - Parallel data files combined with "coverage combine" are deleted after they're combined, to clean up unneeded files. Fixes [issue 40](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/40).
  - Exceptions thrown from product code run with "coverage run" are now displayed without internal coverage.py frames, so the output is the same as when the code is run without coverage.py.
  - The <span class="title-ref">data\_suffix</span> argument to the coverage constructor is now appended with an added dot rather than simply appended, so that .coveragerc files will not be confused for data files.
  - Python source files that don't end with a newline can now be executed, fixing [issue 47](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/47).
  - Added an AUTHORS.txt file.

## Version 3.2 — 2009-12-05

  - Added a `--version` option on the command line.

## Version 3.2b4 — 2009-12-01

  - Branch coverage improvements:
      - The XML report now includes branch information.
  - Click-to-sort HTML report columns are now persisted in a cookie. Viewing a report will sort it first the way you last had a coverage report sorted. Thanks, [Chris Adams](http://chris.improbable.org).
  - On Python 3.x, setuptools has been replaced by [Distribute](https://pypi.org/project/distribute/).

## Version 3.2b3 — 2009-11-23

  - Fixed a memory leak in the C tracer that was introduced in 3.2b1.
  - Branch coverage improvements:
      - Branches to excluded code are ignored.
  - The table of contents in the HTML report is now sortable: click the headers on any column. Thanks, [Chris Adams](http://chris.improbable.org).

## Version 3.2b2 — 2009-11-19

  - Branch coverage improvements:
      - Classes are no longer incorrectly marked as branches: [issue 32](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/32).
      - "except" clauses with types are no longer incorrectly marked as branches: [issue 35](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/35).
  - Fixed some problems syntax coloring sources with line continuations and source with tabs: [issue 30](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/30) and [issue 31](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/31).
  - The --omit option now works much better than before, fixing [issue 14](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/14) and [issue 33](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/33). Thanks, Danek Duvall.

## Version 3.2b1 — 2009-11-10

  - Branch coverage\!
  - XML reporting has file paths that let Cobertura find the source code.
  - The tracer code has changed, it's a few percent faster.
  - Some exceptions reported by the command line interface have been cleaned up so that tracebacks inside coverage.py aren't shown. Fixes [issue 23](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/23).

## Version 3.1 — 2009-10-04

  - Source code can now be read from eggs. Thanks, Ross Lawley. Fixes [issue 25](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/25).

## Version 3.1b1 — 2009-09-27

  - Python 3.1 is now supported.
  - Coverage.py has a new command line syntax with sub-commands. This expands the possibilities for adding features and options in the future. The old syntax is still supported. Try "coverage help" to see the new commands. Thanks to Ben Finney for early help.
  - Added an experimental "coverage xml" command for producing coverage reports in a Cobertura-compatible XML format. Thanks, Bill Hart.
  - Added the --timid option to enable a simpler slower trace function that works for DecoratorTools projects, including TurboGears. Fixed [issue 12](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/12) and [issue 13](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/13).
  - HTML reports show modules from other directories. Fixed [issue 11](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/11).
  - HTML reports now display syntax-colored Python source.
  - Programs that change directory will still write .coverage files in the directory where execution started. Fixed [issue 24](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/24).
  - Added a "coverage debug" command for getting diagnostic information about the coverage.py installation.

## Version 3.0.1 — 2009-07-07

  - Removed the recursion limit in the tracer function. Previously, code that ran more than 500 frames deep would crash. Fixed [issue 9](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/9).
  - Fixed a bizarre problem involving pyexpat, whereby lines following XML parser invocations could be overlooked. Fixed [issue 10](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/10).
  - On Python 2.3, coverage.py could mis-measure code with exceptions being raised. This is now fixed.
  - The coverage.py code itself will now not be measured by coverage.py, and no coverage.py modules will be mentioned in the nose --with-cover plug-in. Fixed [issue 8](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/8).
  - When running source files, coverage.py now opens them in universal newline mode just like Python does. This lets it run Windows files on Mac, for example.

## Version 3.0 — 2009-06-13

  - Fixed the way the Python library was ignored. Too much code was being excluded the old way.
  - Tabs are now properly converted in HTML reports. Previously indentation was lost. Fixed [issue 6](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/6).
  - Nested modules now get a proper flat\_rootname. Thanks, Christian Heimes.

## Version 3.0b3 — 2009-05-16

  - Added parameters to coverage.\_\_init\_\_ for options that had been set on the coverage object itself.
  - Added clear\_exclude() and get\_exclude\_list() methods for programmatic manipulation of the exclude regexes.
  - Added coverage.load() to read previously-saved data from the data file.
  - Improved the finding of code files. For example, .pyc files that have been installed after compiling are now located correctly. Thanks, Detlev Offenbach.
  - When using the object API (that is, constructing a coverage() object), data is no longer saved automatically on process exit. You can re-enable it with the auto\_data=True parameter on the coverage() constructor. The module-level interface still uses automatic saving.

## Version 3.0b2 — 2009-04-30

HTML reporting, and continued refactoring.

  - HTML reports and annotation of source files: use the new -b (browser) switch. Thanks to George Song for code, inspiration and guidance.
  - Code in the Python standard library is not measured by default. If you need to measure standard library code, use the -L command-line switch during execution, or the cover\_pylib=True argument to the coverage() constructor.
  - Source annotation into a directory (-a -d) behaves differently. The annotated files are named with their hierarchy flattened so that same-named files from different directories no longer collide. Also, only files in the current tree are included.
  - coverage.annotate\_file is no longer available.
  - Programs executed with -x now behave more as they should, for example, \_\_file\_\_ has the correct value.
  - .coverage data files have a new pickle-based format designed for better extensibility.
  - Removed the undocumented cache\_file argument to coverage.usecache().

## Version 3.0b1 — 2009-03-07

Major overhaul.

  - Coverage.py is now a package rather than a module. Functionality has been split into classes.
  - The trace function is implemented in C for speed. Coverage.py runs are now much faster. Thanks to David Christian for productive micro-sprints and other encouragement.
  - Executable lines are identified by reading the line number tables in the compiled code, removing a great deal of complicated analysis code.
  - Precisely which lines are considered executable has changed in some cases. Therefore, your coverage stats may also change slightly.
  - The singleton coverage object is only created if the module-level functions are used. This maintains the old interface while allowing better programmatic use of coverage.py.
  - The minimum supported Python version is 2.3.

## Version 2.85 — 2008-09-14

  - Add support for finding source files in eggs. Don't check for morf's being instances of ModuleType, instead use duck typing so that pseudo-modules can participate. Thanks, Imri Goldberg.
  - Use os.realpath as part of the fixing of file names so that symlinks won't confuse things. Thanks, Patrick Mezard.

## Version 2.80 — 2008-05-25

  - Open files in rU mode to avoid line ending craziness. Thanks, Edward Loper.

## Version 2.78 — 2007-09-30

  - Don't try to predict whether a file is Python source based on the extension. Extension-less files are often Pythons scripts. Instead, simply parse the file and catch the syntax errors. Hat tip to Ben Finney.

## Version 2.77 — 2007-07-29

  - Better packaging.

## Version 2.76 — 2007-07-23

  - Now Python 2.5 is *really* fully supported: the body of the new with statement is counted as executable.

## Version 2.75 — 2007-07-22

  - Python 2.5 now fully supported. The method of dealing with multi-line statements is now less sensitive to the exact line that Python reports during execution. Pass statements are handled specially so that their disappearance during execution won't throw off the measurement.

## Version 2.7 — 2007-07-21

  - "\#pragma: nocover" is excluded by default.
  - Properly ignore docstrings and other constant expressions that appear in the middle of a function, a problem reported by Tim Leslie.
  - coverage.erase() shouldn't clobber the exclude regex. Change how parallel mode is invoked, and fix erase() so that it erases the cache when called programmatically.
  - In reports, ignore code executed from strings, since we can't do anything useful with it anyway.
  - Better file handling on Linux, thanks Guillaume Chazarain.
  - Better shell support on Windows, thanks Noel O'Boyle.
  - Python 2.2 support maintained, thanks Catherine Proulx.
  - Minor changes to avoid lint warnings.

## Version 2.6 — 2006-08-23

  - Applied Joseph Tate's patch for function decorators.
  - Applied Sigve Tjora and Mark van der Wal's fixes for argument handling.
  - Applied Geoff Bache's parallel mode patch.
  - Refactorings to improve testability. Fixes to command-line logic for parallel mode and collect.

## Version 2.5 — 2005-12-04

  - Call threading.settrace so that all threads are measured. Thanks Martin Fuzzey.
  - Add a file argument to report so that reports can be captured to a different destination.
  - Coverage.py can now measure itself.
  - Adapted Greg Rogers' patch for using relative file names, and sorting and omitting files to report on.

## Version 2.2 — 2004-12-31

  - Allow for keyword arguments in the module global functions. Thanks, Allen.

## Version 2.1 — 2004-12-14

  - Return 'analysis' to its original behavior and add 'analysis2'. Add a global for 'annotate', and factor it, adding 'annotate\_file'.

## Version 2.0 — 2004-12-12

Significant code changes.

  - Finding executable statements has been rewritten so that docstrings and other quirks of Python execution aren't mistakenly identified as missing lines.
  - Lines can be excluded from consideration, even entire suites of lines.
  - The file system cache of covered lines can be disabled programmatically.
  - Modernized the code.

# Command line usage

When you install coverage.py, a command-line script called `coverage` is placed on your path. To help with multi-version installs, it will also create a `coverage3` alias, and a `coverage-X.Y` alias, depending on the version of Python you're using. For example, when installing on Python 3.10, you will be able to use `coverage`, `coverage3`, or `coverage-3.10` on the command line.

Coverage.py has a number of commands:

  - **run** -- \[Run a Python program and collect execution data \<cmd\_run\>\](\#run-a-python-program-and-collect-execution-data-\<cmd\_run\>).
  - **combine** -- \[Combine together a number of data files \<cmd\_combine\>\](\#combine-together-a-number-of-data-files-\<cmd\_combine\>).
  - **erase** -- \[Erase previously collected coverage data \<cmd\_erase\>\](\#erase-previously-collected-coverage-data-\<cmd\_erase\>).
  - **report** -- \[Report coverage results \<cmd\_report\>\](\#report-coverage-results-\<cmd\_report\>).
  - **html** --\[Produce annotated HTML listings with coverage results \<cmd\_html\>\](\#produce-annotated-html-listings-with-coverage-results-\<cmd\_html\>).
  - **xml** -- \[Produce an XML report with coverage results \<cmd\_xml\>\](\#produce-an-xml-report-with-coverage-results-\<cmd\_xml\>).
  - **json** -- \[Produce a JSON report with coverage results \<cmd\_json\>\](\#produce-a-json-report-with-coverage-results-\<cmd\_json\>).
  - **lcov** -- \[Produce an LCOV report with coverage results \<cmd\_lcov\>\](\#produce-an-lcov-report-with-coverage-results-\<cmd\_lcov\>).
  - **annotate** --\[Annotate source files with coverage results \<cmd\_annotate\>\](\#annotate-source-files-with-coverage-results-\<cmd\_annotate\>).
  - **debug** -- \[Get diagnostic information \<cmd\_debug\>\](\#get-diagnostic-information-\<cmd\_debug\>).

Help is available with the **help** command, or with the `--help` switch on any other command:

``` console
$ coverage help
$ coverage help run
$ coverage run --help
```

Version information for coverage.py can be displayed with `coverage --version`:

<div class="parsed-literal">

$ coverage --version Coverage.py, version with C extension Documentation at

</div>

Any command can use a configuration file by specifying it with the `--rcfile=FILE` command-line switch. Any option you can set on the command line can also be set in the configuration file. This can be a better way to control coverage.py since the configuration file can be checked into source control, and can provide options that other invocation techniques (like test runner plugins) may not offer. See \[config\](\#config) for more details.

## Execution: `coverage run`

You collect execution data by running your Python program with the **run** command:

``` console
$ coverage run my_program.py arg1 arg2
blah blah ..your program's output.. blah blah
```

Your program runs just as if it had been invoked with the Python command line. Arguments after your file name are passed to your program as usual in `sys.argv`. Rather than providing a file name, you can use the `-m` switch and specify an importable module name instead, just as you can with the Python `-m` switch:

``` console
$ coverage run -m packagename.modulename arg1 arg2
blah blah ..your program's output.. blah blah
```

\> **Note** \> In most cases, the program to use here is a test runner, not your program you are trying to measure. The test runner will run your tests and coverage will measure the coverage of your code along the way.

There are many options:

    $ coverage run --help
    Usage: coverage run [options] <pyfile> [program options]
    
    Run a Python program, measuring code execution.
    
    Options:
      -a, --append          Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it starts
                            clean each time.
      --branch              Measure branch coverage in addition to statement
                            coverage.
      --concurrency=LIBS    Properly measure code using a concurrency library.
                            Valid values are: eventlet, gevent, greenlet,
                            multiprocessing, thread, or a comma-list of them.
      --context=LABEL       The context label to record for this coverage run.
      --data-file=OUTFILE   Write the recorded coverage data to this file.
                            Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      -m, --module          <pyfile> is an importable Python module, not a script
                            path, to be run as 'python -m' would run it.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      -L, --pylib           Measure coverage even inside the Python installed
                            library, which isn't done by default.
      -p, --parallel-mode   Append the machine name, process id and random number
                            to the data file name to simplify collecting data from
                            many processes.
      --source=SRC1,SRC2,...
                            A list of directories or importable names of code to
                            measure.
      --timid               Use the slower Python trace function core.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

If you want \[branch coverage \<branch\>\](\#branch-coverage-\<branch\>) measurement, use the `--branch` flag. Otherwise only statement coverage is measured.

You can specify the code to measure with the `--source`, `--include`, and `--omit` switches. See \[Specifying source files \<source\_execution\>\](\#specifying-source-files-\<source\_execution\>) for details of their interpretation. Remember to put options for run after "run", but before the program invocation:

``` console
$ coverage run --source=dir1,dir2 my_program.py arg1 arg2
$ coverage run --source=dir1,dir2 -m packagename.modulename arg1 arg2
```

\> **Note** \> Specifying `--source` on the `coverage run` command line won't affect subsequent reporting commands like `coverage xml`. Use the \[source \<config\_run\_source\>\](\#source ----\<config\_run\_source\>) setting in the configuration file to apply the setting uniformly to all commands.

Coverage.py can measure multi-threaded programs by default. If you are using more other concurrency support, with the [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), [greenlet](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/), [eventlet](https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/), or [gevent](https://www.gevent.org/) libraries, then coverage.py can get confused. Use the `--concurrency` switch to properly measure programs using these libraries. Give it a value of `multiprocessing`, `thread`, `greenlet`, `eventlet`, or `gevent`. Values other than `thread` require the \[C extension \<install\_extension\>\](\#c-extension \<install\_extension\>).

You can combine multiple values for `--concurrency`, separated with commas. You can specify `thread` and also one of `eventlet`, `gevent`, or `greenlet`.

If you are using `--concurrency=multiprocessing`, you must set other options in the configuration file. Options on the command line will not be passed to the processes that multiprocessing creates. Best practice is to use the configuration file for all options.

If you are measuring coverage in a multi-process program, or across a number of machines, you'll want the `--parallel-mode` switch to keep the data separate during measurement. See \[cmd\_combine\](\#cmd\_combine) below.

You can specify a \[static context \<contexts\>\](\#static-context-\<contexts\>) for a coverage run with `--context`. This can be any label you want, and will be recorded with the data. See \[contexts\](\#contexts) for more information.

By default, coverage.py does not measure code installed with the Python interpreter, for example, the standard library. If you want to measure that code as well as your own, add the `-L` (or `--pylib`) flag.

If your coverage results seem to be overlooking code that you know has been executed, try running coverage.py again with the `--timid` flag. This uses a simpler but slower trace method, and might be needed in rare cases.

In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new `sys.monitoring <python:sys.monitoring>` module by defining a `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` environment variable. This should be faster, though plugins and dynamic contexts are not yet supported with it.

Coverage.py sets an environment variable, `COVERAGE_RUN` to indicate that your code is running under coverage measurement. The value is not relevant, and may change in the future.

These options can also be set in the \[config\_run\](\#config\_run) section of your .coveragerc file.

### Warnings

During execution, coverage.py may warn you about conditions it detects that could affect the measurement process. The possible warnings include:

  - Couldn't parse Python file XXX (couldnt-parse)  
    During reporting, a file was thought to be Python, but it couldn't be parsed as Python.

  - Trace function changed, data is likely wrong: XXX (trace-changed)  
    Coverage measurement depends on a Python setting called the trace function. Other Python code in your product might change that function, which will disrupt coverage.py's measurement. This warning indicates that has happened. The XXX in the message is the new trace function value, which might provide a clue to the cause.

  - Module XXX has no Python source (module-not-python)  
    You asked coverage.py to measure module XXX, but once it was imported, it turned out not to have a corresponding .py file. Without a .py file, coverage.py can't report on missing lines.

  - Module XXX was never imported (module-not-imported)  
    You asked coverage.py to measure module XXX, but it was never imported by your program.

  - No data was collected (no-data-collected)  
    Coverage.py ran your program, but didn't measure any lines as executed. This could be because you asked to measure only modules that never ran, or for other reasons.
    
    To debug this problem, try using `run --debug=trace` to see the tracing decision made for each file.

  - Module XXX was previously imported, but not measured (module-not-measured)  
    You asked coverage.py to measure module XXX, but it had already been imported when coverage started. This meant coverage.py couldn't monitor its execution.

  - Already imported a file that will be measured: XXX (already-imported)  
    File XXX had already been imported when coverage.py started measurement. Your setting for `--source` or `--include` indicates that you wanted to measure that file. Lines will be missing from the coverage report since the execution during import hadn't been measured.

  - \--include is ignored because --source is set (include-ignored)  
    Both `--include` and `--source` were specified while running code. Both are meant to focus measurement on a particular part of your source code, so `--include` is ignored in favor of `--source`.

  - Conflicting dynamic contexts (dynamic-conflict)  
    The `[run] dynamic_context` option is set in the configuration file, but something (probably a test runner plugin) is also calling the <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.switch\_context</span> function to change the context. Only one of these mechanisms should be in use at a time.

  - sys.monitoring isn't available, using default core (no-sysmon)  
    You requested to use the sys.monitoring measurement core, but are running on Python 3.11 or lower where it isn't available. A default core will be used instead.

Individual warnings can be disabled with the \[disable\_warnings \<config\_run\_disable\_warnings\>\](\#disable\_warnings \<config\_run\_disable\_warnings\>) configuration setting. To silence "No data was collected," add this to your configuration file:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[run\] disable\_warnings = no-data-collected

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.run\] disable\_warnings = \["no-data-collected"\]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:run\] disable\_warnings = no-data-collected

</div>

</div>

### Data file

Coverage.py collects execution data in a file called ".coverage". If need be, you can set a new file name with the `COVERAGE_FILE` environment variable. This can include a path to another directory.

By default, each run of your program starts with an empty data set. If you need to run your program multiple times to get complete data (for example, because you need to supply different options), you can accumulate data across runs with the `--append` flag on the **run** command.

## Combining data files: `coverage combine`

Often test suites are run under different conditions, for example, with different versions of Python, or dependencies, or on different operating systems. In these cases, you can collect coverage data for each test run, and then combine all the separate data files into one combined file for reporting.

The **combine** command reads a number of separate data files, matches the data by source file name, and writes a combined data file with all of the data.

Coverage normally writes data to a filed named ".coverage". The `run --parallel-mode` switch (or `[run] parallel=True` configuration option) tells coverage to expand the file name to include machine name, process id, and a random number so that every data file is distinct:

``` console
.coverage.Neds-MacBook-Pro.local.88335.316857
.coverage.Geometer.8044.799674
```

You can also define a new data file name with the `[run] data_file` option.

Once you have created a number of these files, you can copy them all to a single directory, and use the **combine** command to combine them into one .coverage data file:

``` console
$ coverage combine
```

You can also name directories or files to be combined on the command line:

``` console
$ coverage combine data1.dat windows_data_files/
```

Coverage.py will collect the data from those places and combine them. The current directory isn't searched if you use command-line arguments. If you also want data from the current directory, name it explicitly on the command line.

When coverage.py combines data files, it looks for files named the same as the data file (defaulting to ".coverage"), with a dotted suffix. Here are some examples of data files that can be combined:

``` console
.coverage.machine1
.coverage.20120807T212300
.coverage.last_good_run.ok
```

An existing combined data file is ignored and re-written. If you want to use **combine** to accumulate results into the .coverage data file over a number of runs, use the `--append` switch on the **combine** command. This behavior was the default before version 4.2.

If any of the data files can't be read, coverage.py will print a warning indicating the file and the problem.

The original input data files are deleted once they've been combined. If you want to keep those files, use the `--keep` command-line option.

    $ coverage combine --help
    Usage: coverage combine [options] <path1> <path2> ... <pathN>
    
    Combine data from multiple coverage files. The combined results are written to
    a single file representing the union of the data. The positional arguments are
    data files or directories containing data files. If no paths are provided,
    data files in the default data file's directory are combined.
    
    Options:
      -a, --append          Append coverage data to .coverage, otherwise it starts
                            clean each time.
      --data-file=DATAFILE  Base name of the data files to operate on. Defaults to
                            '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --keep                Keep original coverage files, otherwise they are
                            deleted.
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

### Re-mapping paths

To combine data for a source file, coverage has to find its data in each of the data files. Different test runs may run the same source file from different locations. For example, different operating systems will use different paths for the same file, or perhaps each Python version is run from a different subdirectory. Coverage needs to know that different file paths are actually the same source file for reporting purposes.

You can tell coverage.py how different source locations relate with a `[paths]` section in your configuration file (see \[config\_paths\](\#config\_paths)). It might be more convenient to use the `[run] relative_files` setting to store relative file paths (see \[relative\_files \<config\_run\_relative\_files\>\](\#relative\_files \<config\_run\_relative\_files\>)).

If data isn't combining properly, you can see details about the inner workings with `--debug=pathmap`.

## Erase data: `coverage erase`

To erase the collected data, use the **erase** command:

    $ coverage erase --help
    Usage: coverage erase [options]
    
    Erase previously collected coverage data.
    
    Options:
      --data-file=DATAFILE  Base name of the data files to operate on. Defaults to
                            '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

If your configuration file indicates parallel data collection, **erase** will remove all of the data files.

## Reporting

Coverage.py provides a few styles of reporting, with the **report**, **html**, **annotate**, **json**, **lcov**, and **xml** commands. They share a number of common options.

The command-line arguments are module or file names to report on, if you'd like to report on a subset of the data collected.

The `--include` and `--omit` flags specify lists of file name patterns. They control which files to report on, and are described in more detail in \[source\](\#source).

The `-i` or `--ignore-errors` switch tells coverage.py to ignore problems encountered trying to find source files to report on. This can be useful if some files are missing, or if your Python execution is tricky enough that file names are synthesized without real source files.

If you provide a `--fail-under` value, the total percentage covered will be compared to that value. If it is less, the command will exit with a status code of 2, indicating that the total coverage was less than your target. This can be used as part of a pass/fail condition, for example in a continuous integration server. This option isn't available for **annotate**.

These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See \[Configuration: \[report\] \<config\_report\>\](\#configuration:-\[report\]-\<config\_report\>).

## Coverage summary: `coverage report`

The simplest reporting is a textual summary produced with **report**:

``` console
$ coverage report
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover
---------------------------------------------
my_program.py                20      4    80%
my_module.py                 15      2    86%

For each module executed, the report shows the count of executable statements, the number of those statements missed, and the resulting coverage, expressed as a percentage.

    $ coverage report --help
    Usage: coverage report [options] [modules]
    
    Report coverage statistics on modules.
    
    Options:
      --contexts=REGEX1,REGEX2,...
                            Only display data from lines covered in the given
                            contexts. Accepts Python regexes, which must be
                            quoted.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      --format=FORMAT       Output format, either text (default), markdown, or
                            total.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      --precision=N         Number of digits after the decimal point to display
                            for reported coverage percentages.
      --sort=COLUMN         Sort the report by the named column: name, stmts,
                            miss, branch, brpart, or cover. Default is name.
      -m, --show-missing    Show line numbers of statements in each module that
                            weren't executed.
      --skip-covered        Skip files with 100% coverage.
      --no-skip-covered     Disable --skip-covered.

                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

The `-m` flag also shows the line numbers of missing statements:

``` console
$ coverage report -m
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
-------------------------------------------------------
my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
my_module.py                 15      2    86%   8, 12
my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        91     12    87%
```

If you are using branch coverage, then branch statistics will be reported in the Branch and BrPart (for Partial Branch) columns, the Missing column will detail the missed branches:

``` console
$ coverage report -m
Name                      Stmts   Miss Branch BrPart  Cover   Missing
---------------------------------------------------------------------
my_program.py                20      4     10      2    80%   33-35, 36->38, 39
my_module.py                 15      2      3      0    86%   8, 12
my_other_module.py           56      6      5      1    89%   17-23, 40->45
---------------------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        91     12     18      3    87%
```

You can restrict the report to only certain files by naming them on the command line:

``` console
$ coverage report -m my_program.py my_other_module.py
Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
-------------------------------------------------------
my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
-------------------------------------------------------
TOTAL                        76     10    87%
```

The `--skip-covered` switch will skip any file with 100% coverage, letting you focus on the files that still need attention. The `--no-skip-covered` option can be used if needed to see all the files. The `--skip-empty` switch will skip any file with no executable statements.

If you have \[recorded contexts \<contexts\>\](\#recorded-contexts-\<contexts\>), the `--contexts` option lets you choose which contexts to report on. See \[context\_reporting\](\#context\_reporting) for details.

The `--precision` option controls the number of digits displayed after the decimal point in coverage percentages, defaulting to none.

The `--sort` option is the name of a column to sort the report by.

The `--format` option controls the style of the report. `--format=text` creates plain text tables as shown above. `--format=markdown` creates Markdown tables. `--format=total` writes out a single number, the total coverage percentage as shown at the end of the tables, but without a percent sign.

Other common reporting options are described above in \[cmd\_reporting\](\#cmd\_reporting). These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See \[Configuration: \[report\] \<config\_report\>\](\#configuration:-\[report\]-\<config\_report\>).

## HTML reporting: `coverage html`

Coverage.py can annotate your source code to show which lines were executed and which were not. The **html** command creates an HTML report similar to the **report** summary, but as an HTML file. Each module name links to the source file decorated to show the status of each line.

Here's a [sample report](https://nedbatchelder.com/files/sample_coverage_html/index.html).

Lines are highlighted: green for executed, red for missing, and gray for excluded. If you've used branch coverage, partial branches are yellow. The colored counts at the top of the file are buttons to turn on and off the highlighting.

A number of keyboard shortcuts are available for navigating the report. Click the keyboard icon in the upper right to see the complete list.

    $ coverage html --help
    Usage: coverage html [options] [modules]
    
    Create an HTML report of the coverage of the files.  Each file gets its own
    page, with the source decorated to show executed, excluded, and missed lines.
    
    Options:
      --contexts=REGEX1,REGEX2,...
                            Only display data from lines covered in the given
                            contexts. Accepts Python regexes, which must be
                            quoted.
      -d DIR, --directory=DIR
                            Write the output files to DIR.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      --precision=N         Number of digits after the decimal point to display
                            for reported coverage percentages.
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --show-contexts       Show contexts for covered lines.
      --skip-covered        Skip files with 100% coverage.
      --no-skip-covered     Disable --skip-covered.
      --skip-empty          Skip files with no code.
      --title=TITLE         A text string to use as the title on the HTML.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

The title of the report can be set with the `title` setting in the `[html]` section of the configuration file, or the `--title` switch on the command line.

If you prefer a different style for your HTML report, you can provide your own CSS file to apply, by specifying a CSS file in the `[html]` section of the configuration file. See \[config\_html\_extra\_css\](\#config\_html\_extra\_css) for details.

The `-d` argument specifies an output directory, defaulting to "htmlcov":

``` console
$ coverage html -d coverage_html
```

Other common reporting options are described above in \[cmd\_reporting\](\#cmd\_reporting).

Generating the HTML report can be time-consuming. Stored with the HTML report is a data file that is used to speed up reporting the next time. If you generate a new report into the same directory, coverage.py will skip generating unchanged pages, making the process faster.

The `--skip-covered` switch will skip any file with 100% coverage, letting you focus on the files that still need attention. The `--skip-empty` switch will skip any file with no executable statements.

The `--precision` option controls the number of digits displayed after the decimal point in coverage percentages, defaulting to none.

If you have \[recorded contexts \<contexts\>\](\#recorded-contexts-\<contexts\>), the `--contexts` option lets you choose which contexts to report on, and the `--show-contexts` option will annotate lines with the contexts that ran them. See \[context\_reporting\](\#context\_reporting) for details.

These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See \[Configuration: \[html\] \<config\_html\>\](\#configuration:-\[html\]-\<config\_html\>).

## XML reporting: `coverage xml`

The **xml** command writes coverage data to a "coverage.xml" file in a format compatible with [Cobertura](http://cobertura.github.io/cobertura/).

    $ coverage xml --help
    Usage: coverage xml [options] [modules]
    
    Generate an XML report of coverage results.
    
    Options:
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      --fail-under=MIN      Exit with a status of 2 if the total coverage is less
                            than MIN.
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      -o OUTFILE            Write the XML report to this file. Defaults to
                            'coverage.xml'
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --skip-empty          Skip files with no code.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

You can specify the name of the output file with the `-o` switch.

Other common reporting options are described above in \[cmd\_reporting\](\#cmd\_reporting).

To include complete file paths in the output file, rather than just the file name, use \[include\] vs \[source\] in your ".coveragerc" file.

For example, use this:

``` ini
[run]
include =
    foo/*
    bar/*
```

which will result in

``` xml
<class filename="bar/hello.py">
<class filename="bar/baz/hello.py">
<class filename="foo/hello.py">
```

in place of this:

``` ini
[run]
source =
    foo
    bar
```

which may result in

``` xml
<class filename="hello.py">
<class filename="baz/hello.py">
```

These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See \[Configuration: \[xml\] \<config\_xml\>\](\#configuration:-\[xml\]-\<config\_xml\>).

## JSON reporting: `coverage json`

The **json** command writes coverage data to a "coverage.json" file.

    $ coverage json --help
    Usage: coverage json [options] [modules]
    
    Generate a JSON report of coverage results.
    
    Options:

      --pretty-print        Format the JSON for human readers.
      -q, --quiet           Don't print messages about what is happening.
      --show-contexts       Show contexts for covered lines.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

You can specify the name of the output file with the `-o` switch. The JSON can be nicely formatted by specifying the `--pretty-print` switch.

Other common reporting options are described above in \[cmd\_reporting\](\#cmd\_reporting). These options can also be set in your .coveragerc file. See \[Configuration: \[json\] \<config\_json\>\](\#configuration:-\[json\]-\<config\_json\>).

## LCOV reporting: `coverage lcov`

The **lcov** command writes coverage data to a "coverage.lcov" file.

    $ coverage lcov --help

## Text annotation: `coverage annotate`

\> **Note** \> The **annotate** command has been obsoleted by more modern reporting tools, including the **html** command.

The **annotate** command produces a text annotation of your source code. With a `-d` argument specifying an output directory, each Python file becomes a text file in that directory. Without `-d`, the files are written into the same directories as the original Python files.

Coverage status for each line of source is indicated with a character prefix:

``` console
> executed
! missing (not executed)
- excluded
```

For example:

``` console
# A simple function, never called with x==1

> def h(x):
    """Silly function."""
-     if 0:  # pragma: no cover
-         pass
>     if x == 1:
!         a = 1
>     else:
>         a = 2
```

    $ coverage annotate --help
    Usage: coverage annotate [options] [modules]
    
    Make annotated copies of the given files, marking statements that are executed
    with > and statements that are missed with !.
    
    Options:
      -d DIR, --directory=DIR
                            Write the output files to DIR.
      --data-file=INFILE    Read coverage data for report generation from this
                            file. Defaults to '.coverage'. [env: COVERAGE_FILE]
      -i, --ignore-errors   Ignore errors while reading source files.
      --include=PAT1,PAT2,...
                            Include only files whose paths match one of these
                            patterns. Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be
                            quoted.
      --omit=PAT1,PAT2,...  Omit files whose paths match one of these patterns.
                            Accepts shell-style wildcards, which must be quoted.
      --debug=OPTS          Debug options, separated by commas. [env:
                            COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help            Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE       Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                            'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are
                            tried. [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

Other common reporting options are described above in \[cmd\_reporting\](\#cmd\_reporting).

## Diagnostics: `coverage debug`

The **debug** command shows internal information to help diagnose problems. If you are reporting a bug about coverage.py, including the output of this command can often help:

``` console
$ coverage debug sys > please_attach_to_bug_report.txt
```

A few types of information are available:

  - `config`: show coverage's configuration
  - `sys`: show system configuration
  - `data`: show a summary of the collected coverage data
  - `premain`: show the call stack invoking coverage
  - `pybehave`: show internal flags describing Python behavior

<!-- end list -->

    $ coverage debug --help
    Usage: coverage debug <topic>
    
    Display information about the internals of coverage.py, for diagnosing
    problems. Topics are: 'data' to show a summary of the collected data; 'sys' to
    show installation information; 'config' to show the configuration; 'premain'
    to show what is calling coverage; 'pybehave' to show internal flags describing
    Python behavior.
    
    Options:
      --debug=OPTS     Debug options, separated by commas. [env: COVERAGE_DEBUG]
      -h, --help       Get help on this command.
      --rcfile=RCFILE  Specify configuration file. By default '.coveragerc',
                       'setup.cfg', 'tox.ini', and 'pyproject.toml' are tried.
                       [env: COVERAGE_RCFILE]

### `--debug`

The `--debug` option is also available on all commands. It instructs coverage.py to log internal details of its operation, to help with diagnosing problems. It takes a comma-separated list of options, each indicating a facet of operation to log:

  - `callers`: annotate each debug message with a stack trace of the callers to that point.
  - `config`: before starting, dump all the \[configuration \<config\>\](\#configuration-\<config\>) values.
  - `dataio`: log when reading or writing any data file.
  - `dataop`: log a summary of data being added to CoverageData objects.
  - `dataop2`: when used with `debug=dataop`, log the actual data being added to CoverageData objects.
  - `lock`: log operations acquiring locks in the data layer.
  - `multiproc`: log the start and stop of multiprocessing processes.
  - `pathmap`: log the remapping of paths that happens during `coverage combine`. See \[config\_paths\](\#config\_paths).
  - `pid`: annotate all warnings and debug output with the process and thread ids.
  - `plugin`: print information about plugin operations.
  - `process`: show process creation information, and changes in the current directory. This also writes a time stamp and command arguments into the data file.
  - `pybehave`: show the values of [internal flags](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/blob/master/coverage/env.py) describing the behavior of the current version of Python.
  - `pytest`: indicate the name of the current pytest test when it changes.
  - `self`: annotate each debug message with the object printing the message.
  - `sql`: log the SQL statements used for recording data.
  - `sqldata`: when used with `debug=sql`, also log the full data being used in SQL statements.
  - `sys`: before starting, dump all the system and environment information, as with \[coverage debug sys \<cmd\_debug\>\](\#coverage-debug-sys-\<cmd\_debug\>).
  - `trace`: print every decision about whether to trace a file or not. For files not being traced, the reason is also given.

Debug options can also be set with the `COVERAGE_DEBUG` environment variable, a comma-separated list of these options, or in the \[config\_run\_debug\](\#config\_run\_debug) section of the .coveragerc file.

The debug output goes to stderr, unless the \[config\_run\_debug\_file\](\#config\_run\_debug\_file) setting or the `COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE` environment variable names a different file, which will be appended to. This can be useful because many test runners capture output, which could hide important details. `COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE` accepts the special names `stdout` and `stderr` to write to those destinations.

# Configuration reference

Coverage.py options can be specified in a configuration file. This makes it easier to re-run coverage.py with consistent settings, and also allows for specification of options that are otherwise only available in the \[API \<api\>\](\#api-\<api\>).

Configuration files also make it easier to get coverage testing of spawned sub-processes. See \[subprocess\](\#subprocess) for more details.

The default name for the configuration file is `.coveragerc`, in the same directory coverage.py is being run in. Most of the settings in the configuration file are tied to your source code and how it should be measured, so it should be stored with your source, and checked into source control, rather than put in your home directory.

A different location for the configuration file can be specified with the `--rcfile=FILE` command line option or with the `COVERAGE_RCFILE` environment variable.

If `.coveragerc` doesn't exist and another file hasn't been specified, then coverage.py will look for settings in other common configuration files, in this order: setup.cfg, tox.ini, or pyproject.toml. The first file found with coverage.py settings will be used and other files won't be consulted.

Coverage.py will read from "pyproject.toml" if TOML support is available, either because you are running on Python 3.11 or later, or because you installed with the `toml` extra (`pip install coverage[toml]`).

## Syntax

The specific syntax of a configuration file depends on what type it is. All configuration files are assumed to be in INI format, unless their file extension is .toml, which are TOML.

### INI Syntax

A coverage.py configuration file is in classic .ini file format: sections are introduced by a `[section]` header, and contain `name = value` entries. Lines beginning with `#` or `;` are ignored as comments.

Strings don't need quotes. Multi-valued strings can be created by indenting values on multiple lines.

Boolean values can be specified as `on`, `off`, `true`, `false`, `1`, or `0` and are case-insensitive.

In setup.cfg or tox.ini, the section names have "coverage:" prefixed, so the `[run]` options described below will be found in the `[coverage:run]` section of the file.

### TOML Syntax

[TOML syntax](https://toml.io) uses explicit lists with brackets, and strings with quotes. Booleans are `true` or `false`.

Configuration must be within the `[tool.coverage]` section, for example, `[tool.coverage.run]`. Environment variable expansion in values is available, but only within quoted strings, even for non-string values.

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be substituted in by using dollar signs: `$WORD` or `${WORD}` will be replaced with the value of `WORD` in the environment. A dollar sign can be inserted with `$$`. Special forms can be used to control what happens if the variable isn't defined in the environment:

  - If you want to raise an error if an environment variable is undefined, use a question mark suffix: `${WORD?}`.
  - If you want to provide a default for missing variables, use a dash with a default value: `${WORD-default value}`.
  - Otherwise, missing environment variables will result in empty strings with no error.

### Sample file

Here's a sample configuration file, in each syntax:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

</div>

</div>

The specific configuration settings are described below. Many sections and settings correspond roughly to commands and options in the \[command-line interface \<cmd\>\](\#command-line interface-\<cmd\>).

## \[run\]

These settings are generally used when running product code, though some apply to more than one command.

### \[run\] branch

(boolean, default False) Whether to measure \[branch coverage \<branch\>\](\#branch-coverage-\<branch\>) in addition to statement coverage.

### \[run\] command\_line

(string) The command-line to run your program. This will be used if you run `coverage run` with no further arguments. Coverage.py options cannot be specified here, other than `-m` to indicate the module to run.

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

### \[run\] concurrency

(multi-string, default "thread") The concurrency libraries in use by the product code. If your program uses [multiprocessing](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html), [gevent](https://www.gevent.org/), [greenlet](https://greenlet.readthedocs.io/), or [eventlet](https://eventlet.readthedocs.io/), you must name that library in this option, or coverage.py will produce very wrong results.

See \[subprocess\](\#subprocess) for details of multi-process measurement.

Before version 4.2, this option only accepted a single string.

<div class="versionadded">

4.0

</div>

### \[run\] context

(string) The static context to record for this coverage run. See \[contexts\](\#contexts) for more information

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

### \[run\] cover\_pylib

(boolean, default False) Whether to measure the Python standard library.

### \[run\] data\_file

(string, default ".coverage") The name of the data file to use for storing or reporting coverage. This value can include a path to another directory.

### \[run\] disable\_warnings

(multi-string) A list of warnings to disable. Warnings that can be disabled include a short string at the end, the name of the warning. See \[cmd\_warnings\](\#cmd\_warnings) for specific warnings.

### \[run\] debug

(multi-string) A list of debug options. See \[the run --debug option \<cmd\_run\_debug\>\](\#the-run---debug-option \<cmd\_run\_debug\>) for details.

### \[run\] debug\_file

(string) A file name to write debug output to. See \[the run --debug option \<cmd\_run\_debug\>\](\#the-run---debug option-\<cmd\_run\_debug\>) for details.

### \[run\] dynamic\_context

(string) The name of a strategy for setting the dynamic context during execution. See \[dynamic\_contexts\](\#dynamic\_contexts) for details.

### \[run\] include

(multi-string) A list of file name patterns, the files to include in measurement or reporting. Ignored if `source` is set. See \[source\](\#source) for details.

### \[run\] omit

(multi-string) A list of file name patterns, the files to leave out of measurement or reporting. See \[source\](\#source) for details.

### \[run\] parallel

(boolean, default False) Append the machine name, process id and random number to the data file name to simplify collecting data from many processes. See \[cmd\_combine\](\#cmd\_combine) for more information.

### \[run\] plugins

(multi-string) A list of plugin package names. See \[plugins\](\#plugins) for more information.

### \[run\] relative\_files

(boolean, default False) store relative file paths in the data file. This makes it easier to measure code in one (or multiple) environments, and then report in another. See \[cmd\_combine\](\#cmd\_combine) for details.

Note that setting `source` has to be done in the configuration file rather than the command line for this option to work, since the reporting commands need to know the source origin.

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

### \[run\] sigterm

(boolean, default False) if true, register a SIGTERM signal handler to capture data when the process ends due to a SIGTERM signal. This includes <span class="title-ref">Process.terminate \<python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate\></span>, and other ways to terminate a process. This can help when collecting data in usual situations, but can also introduce problems (see [issue 1310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310)).

Only on Linux and Mac.

<div class="versionadded">

6.4 (in 6.3 this was always enabled)

</div>

### \[run\] source

(multi-string) A list of packages or directories, the source to measure during execution. If set, `include` is ignored. See \[source\](\#source) for details.

### \[run\] source\_pkgs

(multi-string) A list of packages, the source to measure during execution. Operates the same as `source`, but only names packages, for resolving ambiguities between packages and directories.

<div class="versionadded">

5.3

</div>

### \[run\] timid

(boolean, default False) Use a simpler but slower trace method. This uses the PyTracer trace function core instead of CTracer, and is only needed in very unusual circumstances.

## \[paths\]

The entries in this section are lists of file paths that should be considered equivalent when combining data from different machines:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[paths\] source = src/ /jenkins/build/\*/src c:myprojsrc

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.paths\] source = \[ "src/", "/jenkins/build/\*/src", "c:\\myproj\\src", \]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:paths\] source = src/ /jenkins/build/\*/src c:myprojsrc

</div>

</div>

The names of the entries ("source" in this example) are ignored, you may choose any name that you like. The value is a list of strings. When combining data with the `combine` command, two file paths will be combined if they start with paths from the same list.

The first value must be an actual file path on the machine where the reporting will happen, so that source code can be found. The other values can be file patterns to match against the paths of collected data, or they can be absolute or relative file paths on the current machine.

In this example, data collected for "/jenkins/build/1234/src/module.py" will be combined with data for "c:\\myproj\\src\\module.py", and will be reported against the source file found at "src/module.py".

If you specify more than one list of paths, they will be considered in order. A file path will only be remapped if the result exists. If a path matches a list, but the result doesn't exist, the next list will be tried. The first list that has an existing result will be used.

Remapping will also be done during reporting, but only within the single data file being reported. Combining multiple files requires the `combine` command.

The `--debug=pathmap` option can be used to log details of the re-mapping of paths. See \[the --debug option \<cmd\_run\_debug\>\](\#the---debug-option-\<cmd\_run\_debug\>).

See \[cmd\_combine\_remapping\](\#cmd\_combine\_remapping) and \[source\_glob\](\#source\_glob) for more information.

## \[report\]

Settings common to many kinds of reporting.

### \[report\] exclude\_also

(multi-string) A list of regular expressions. This setting is similar to \[config\_report\_exclude\_lines\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_lines): it specifies patterns for lines to exclude from reporting. This setting is preferred, because it will preserve the default exclude pattern `pragma: no cover` instead of overwriting it.

See \[config\_report\_exclude\_lines\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_lines) for further details.

<div class="versionadded">

7.2.0

</div>

### \[report\] exclude\_lines

(multi-string) A list of regular expressions. Any line of your source code containing a match for one of these regexes is excluded from being reported as missing. More details are in \[excluding\](\#excluding). If you use this option, you are replacing all the exclude regexes, so you'll need to also supply the "pragma: no cover" regex if you still want to use it. The \[config\_report\_exclude\_also\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_also) setting can be used to specify patterns without overwriting the default set.

You can exclude lines introducing blocks, and the entire block is excluded. If you exclude a `def` line or decorator line, the entire function is excluded.

Be careful when writing this setting: the values are regular expressions that only have to match a portion of the line. For example, if you write `...`, you'll exclude any line with three or more of any character. If you write `pass`, you'll also exclude the line `my_pass="foo"`, and so on.

All of the regexes here and in \[config\_report\_exclude\_also\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_also) are combined into one regex for processing, so you cannot use global flags like `(?s)` in your regexes. Use the scoped flag form instead: `(?s:...)`

### \[report\] fail\_under

(float) A target coverage percentage. If the total coverage measurement is under this value, then exit with a status code of 2. If you specify a non-integral value, you must also set `[report] precision` properly to make use of the decimal places. A setting of 100 will fail any value under 100, regardless of the number of decimal places of precision.

### \[report\] format

(string, default "text") The format to use for the textual report. The default is "text" which produces a simple textual table. You can use "markdown" to produce a Markdown table, or "total" to output only the total coverage percentage.

<div class="versionadded">

7.0

</div>

### \[report\] ignore\_errors

(boolean, default False) Ignore source code that can't be found, emitting a warning instead of an exception.

### \[report\] include

(multi-string) A list of file name patterns, the files to include in reporting. See \[source\](\#source) for details.

### \[report\] include\_namespace\_packages

(boolean, default False) When searching for completely un-executed files, include directories without `__init__.py` files. These are [implicit namespace packages](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/), and are usually skipped.

<div class="versionadded">

7.0

</div>

### \[report\] omit

(multi-string) A list of file name patterns, the files to leave out of reporting. See \[source\](\#source) for details.

### \[report\] partial\_branches

(multi-string) A list of regular expressions. Any line of code that matches one of these regexes is excused from being reported as a partial branch. More details are in \[branch\](\#branch). If you use this option, you are replacing all the partial branch regexes so you'll need to also supply the "pragma: no branch" regex if you still want to use it.

### \[report\] precision

(integer) The number of digits after the decimal point to display for reported coverage percentages. The default is 0, displaying for example "87%". A value of 2 will display percentages like "87.32%". This setting also affects the interpretation of the `fail_under` setting.

### \[report\] show\_missing

(boolean, default False) When running a summary report, show missing lines. See \[cmd\_report\](\#cmd\_report) for more information.

### \[report\] skip\_covered

(boolean, default False) Don't report files that are 100% covered. This helps you focus on files that need attention.

### \[report\] skip\_empty

(boolean, default False) Don't report files that have no executable code (such as `__init__.py` files).

### \[report\] sort

(string, default "Name") Sort the text report by the named column. Allowed values are "Name", "Stmts", "Miss", "Branch", "BrPart", or "Cover". Prefix with `-` for descending sort (for example, "-cover").

## \[html\]

Settings particular to HTML reporting. The settings in the `[report]` section also apply to HTML output, where appropriate.

### \[html\] directory

(string, default "htmlcov") Where to write the HTML report files.

### \[html\] extra\_css

(string) The path to a file of CSS to apply to the HTML report. The file will be copied into the HTML output directory. Don't name it "style.css". This CSS is in addition to the CSS normally used, though you can overwrite as many of the rules as you like.

### \[html\] show\_contexts

(boolean) Should the HTML report include an indication on each line of which contexts executed the line. See \[dynamic\_contexts\](\#dynamic\_contexts) for details.

### \[html\] skip\_covered

(boolean, defaulted from `[report] skip_covered`) Don't include files in the report that are 100% covered files. See \[cmd\_report\](\#cmd\_report) for more information.

<div class="versionadded">

5.4

</div>

### \[html\] skip\_empty

(boolean, defaulted from `[report] skip_empty`) Don't include empty files (those that have 0 statements) in the report. See \[cmd\_report\](\#cmd\_report) for more information.

<div class="versionadded">

5.4

</div>

### \[html\] title

(string, default "Coverage report") The title to use for the report. Note this is text, not HTML.

## \[xml\]

Settings particular to XML reporting. The settings in the `[report]` section also apply to XML output, where appropriate.

### \[xml\] output

(string, default "coverage.xml") Where to write the XML report.

### \[xml\] package\_depth

(integer, default 99) Controls which directories are identified as packages in the report. Directories deeper than this depth are not reported as packages. The default is that all directories are reported as packages.

## \[json\]

Settings particular to JSON reporting. The settings in the `[report]` section also apply to JSON output, where appropriate.

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

### \[json\] output

(string, default "coverage.json") Where to write the JSON file.

### \[json\] pretty\_print

(boolean, default false) Controls if the JSON is outputted with white space formatted for human consumption (True) or for minimum file size (False).

### \[json\] show\_contexts

(boolean, default false) Should the JSON report include an indication of which contexts executed each line. See \[dynamic\_contexts\](\#dynamic\_contexts) for details.

## \[lcov\]

Settings particular to LCOV reporting (see \[cmd\_lcov\](\#cmd\_lcov)).

<div class="versionadded">

6.3

</div>

### \[lcov\] output

(string, default "coverage.lcov") Where to write the LCOV file.

### \[lcov\] line\_checksums

(boolean, default false) Whether to write per-line checksums as part of the lcov file. Because these checksums cover only lines with actual code on them, and do not verify the ordering of lines, they provide only a weak assurance that the source code available to analysis tools (e.g. `genhtml`) matches the code that was used to generate the coverage data.

# Measurement contexts

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

Coverage.py measures whether code was run, but it can also record the context in which it was run. This can provide more information to help you understand the behavior of your tests.

There are two kinds of context: static and dynamic. Static contexts are fixed for an entire run, and are set explicitly with an option. Dynamic contexts change over the course of a single run.

## Static contexts

A static context is set by an option when you run coverage.py. The value is fixed for the duration of a run. They can be any text you like, for example, "python3" or "with\_numpy". The context is recorded with the data.

When you \[combine multiple data files \<cmd\_combine\>\](\#combine-multiple-data-files-\<cmd\_combine\>) together, they can have differing contexts. All of the information is retained, so that the different contexts are correctly recorded in the combined file.

A static context is specified with the `--context=CONTEXT` option to \[the coverage run command \<cmd\_run\>\](\#the-coverage-run-command-\<cmd\_run\>), or the `[run] context` setting in the configuration file.

## Dynamic contexts

Dynamic contexts are found during execution. They are most commonly used to answer the question "what test ran this line?," but have been generalized to allow any kind of context tracking. As execution proceeds, the dynamic context changes to record the context of execution. Separate data is recorded for each context, so that it can be analyzed later.

There are three ways to enable dynamic contexts:

  - you can set the `[run] dynamic_context` option in your .coveragerc file, or
  - you can enable a \[dynamic context switcher \<dynamic\_context\_plugins\>\](\#dynamic-context-switcher-\<dynamic\_context\_plugins\>) plugin, or
  - another tool (such as a test runner) can call the <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.switch\_context</span> method to set the context explicitly. The pytest plugin [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/) has a `--cov-context` option that uses this to set the dynamic context for each test.

The `[run] dynamic_context` setting has only one option now. Set it to `test_function` to start a new dynamic context for every test function:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[run\] dynamic\_context = test\_function

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.run\] dynamic\_context = "test\_function"

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:run\] dynamic\_context = test\_function

</div>

</div>

Each test function you run will be considered a separate dynamic context, and coverage data will be segregated for each. A test function is any function whose name starts with "test".

If you have both a static context and a dynamic context, they are joined with a pipe symbol to be recorded as a single string.

Initially, when your program starts running, the dynamic context is an empty string. Any code measured before a dynamic context is set will be recorded in this empty context. For example, if you are recording test names as contexts, then the code run by the test runner before (and between) tests will be in the empty context.

Dynamic contexts can be explicitly disabled by setting `dynamic_context` to `none`.

## Context reporting

The `coverage report` and `coverage html` commands both accept `--contexts` option, a comma-separated list of regular expressions. The report will be limited to the contexts that match one of those patterns.

The `coverage html` command also has `--show-contexts`. If set, the HTML report will include an annotation on each covered line indicating the number of contexts that executed the line. Clicking the annotation displays a list of the contexts.

## Raw data

For more advanced reporting or analysis, the .coverage data file is a SQLite database. See \[dbschema\](\#dbschema) for details.

# Contributing to coverage.py

I welcome contributions to coverage.py. Over the years, hundreds of people have provided contributions of various sizes to add features, fix bugs, or just help diagnose thorny issues. This page should have all the information you need to make a contribution.

One source of history or ideas are the [bug reports](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues) against coverage.py. There you can find ideas for requested features, or the remains of rejected ideas.

## Before you begin

If you have an idea for coverage.py, run it by me before you begin writing code. This way, I can get you going in the right direction, or point you to previous work in the area. Things are not always as straightforward as they seem, and having the benefit of lessons learned by those before you can save you frustration.

We have a [\#coverage channel in the Python Discord](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/1253355750684753950) that can be a good place to explore ideas, get help, or help people with coverage.py. [Join us](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/1253355750684753950)\!

## Getting the code

The coverage.py code is hosted on a GitHub repository at <https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy>. To get a working environment, follow these steps:

1.  [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) into your own GitHub account. The coverage.py code will then be copied into a GitHub repository at `https://github.com/GITHUB_USER/coveragepy` where GITHUB\_USER is your GitHub username.

2.  (Optional) Create a virtualenv to work in, and activate it. There are a number of ways to do this. Use the method you are comfortable with. Ideally, use Python 3.9 (the lowest version coverage.py supports).

3.  Clone the repository:
    
    ``` console
    $ git clone https://github.com/GITHUB_USER/coveragepy
    $ cd coveragepy
    ```

4.  Install the requirements with either of these commands:
    
    ``` console
    $ make install
    $ python3 -m pip install -r requirements/dev.pip
    ```
    
    Note: You may need to upgrade pip to install the requirements.

## Running the tests

The tests are written mostly as standard unittest-style tests, and are run with pytest running under [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io/):

Tox runs the complete test suite a few times for each version of Python you have installed. The first run uses the C implementation of the trace function, the second uses the Python implementation. If [sys.monitoring](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.monitoring.html) is available, the suite will be run again with that core.

To limit tox to just a few versions of Python, use the `-e` switch:

``` console
$ python3 -m tox -e py38,py39
```

On the tox command line, options after `--` are passed to pytest. To run just a few tests, you can use [pytest test selectors](https://doc.pytest.org/en/stable/usage.html#specifying-which-tests-to-run):

``` console
$ python3 -m tox -- tests/test_misc.py
$ python3 -m tox -- tests/test_misc.py::HasherTest
$ python3 -m tox -- tests/test_misc.py::HasherTest::test_string_hashing
```

These commands run the tests in one file, one class, and just one test, respectively. The pytest `-k` option selects tests based on a word in their name, which can be very convenient for ad-hoc test selection. Of course you can combine tox and pytest options:

``` console
$ python3 -m tox -q -e py310 -- -n 0 -vv -k hash

```

You can also affect the test runs with environment variables:

  - `COVERAGE_ONE_CORE=1` will use only one tracing core for each Python version. This isn't about CPU cores, it's about the central code that tracks execution. This will use the preferred core for the Python version and implementation being tested.
  - `COVERAGE_TEST_CORES=...` defines the cores to run tests on. Three cores are available, specify them as a comma-separated string:
      - `ctrace` is a sys.settrace function implemented in C.
      - `pytrace` is a sys.settrace function implemented in Python.
      - `sysmon` is a [sys.monitoring](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.monitoring.html) implementation.
  - `COVERAGE_AST_DUMP=1` will dump the AST tree as it is being used during code parsing.

There are other environment variables that affect tests. I use [set\_env.py](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201907/set_envpy.html) as a simple terminal interface to see and set them.

Of course, run all the tests on every version of Python you have before submitting a change.

## Lint, etc

I try to keep the coverage.py source as clean as possible. I use pylint to alert me to possible problems:

``` console
$ make lint
```

The source is pylint-clean, even if it's because there are pragmas quieting some warnings. Please try to keep it that way, but don't let pylint warnings keep you from sending patches. I can clean them up.

Lines should be kept to a 100-character maximum length. I recommend an [editorconfig.org](http://editorconfig.org) plugin for your editor of choice, which will also help with indentation, line endings and so on.

Other style questions are best answered by looking at the existing code. Formatting of docstrings, comments, long lines, and so on, should match the code that already exists.

Many people love [black](https://pypi.org/project/black/), but I would prefer not to run it on coverage.py.

## Continuous integration

When you make a pull request, [GitHub actions](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/actions) will run all of the tests and quality checks on your changes. If any fail, either fix them or ask for help.

## Dependencies

Coverage.py has no direct runtime dependencies, and I would like to keep it that way.

It has many development dependencies. These are specified generically in the `requirements/*.in` files. The .in files should have no versions specified in them. The specific versions to use are pinned in `requirements/*.pip` files. These are created by running `make upgrade`.

It's important to use Python 3.9 to run `make upgrade` so that the pinned versions will work on all of the Python versions currently supported by coverage.py.

If for some reason we need to constrain a version of a dependency, the constraint should be specified in the `requirements/pins.pip` file, with a detailed reason for the pin.

## Coverage testing coverage.py

Coverage.py can measure itself, but it's complicated. The process has been packaged up to make it easier:

``` console
$ make metacov metahtml
```

Then look at htmlcov/index.html. Note that due to the recursive nature of coverage.py measuring itself, there are some parts of the code that will never appear as covered, even though they are executed.

## Contributing

When you are ready to contribute a change, any way you can get it to me is probably fine. A pull request on GitHub is great, but a simple diff or patch works too.

All contributions are expected to include tests for new functionality and fixes. If you need help writing tests, please ask.

# Coverage.py database schema

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

Coverage.py stores data in a SQLite database, by default called `.coverage`. For most needs, the <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> API will be sufficient, and should be preferred to accessing the database directly. Only advanced uses will need to use the database.

The schema can change without changing the major version of coverage.py, so be careful when accessing the database directly. The `coverage_schema` table has the schema number of the database. The schema described here corresponds to:

    SCHEMA_VERSION = 7

You can use SQLite tools such as the `sqlite3 <python:sqlite3>` module in the Python standard library to access the data. Some data is stored in a packed format that will need custom functions to access. See <span class="title-ref">.register\_sqlite\_functions</span>.

## Database schema

This is the database schema:

`` `sql     CREATE TABLE coverage_schema (         -- One row, to record the version of the schema in this db.         version integer     );      CREATE TABLE meta (         -- Key-value pairs, to record metadata about the data         key text,         value text,         unique (key)         -- Possible keys:         --  'has_arcs' boolean      -- Is this data recording branches?         --  'sys_argv' text         -- The coverage command line that recorded the data.         --  'version' text          -- The version of coverage.py that made the file.         --  'when' text             -- Datetime when the file was created.     );      CREATE TABLE file (         -- A row per file measured.         id integer primary key,         path text,         unique (path)     );      CREATE TABLE context (         -- A row per context measured.         id integer primary key,         context text,         unique (context)     );      CREATE TABLE line_bits (         -- If recording lines, a row per context per file executed.         -- All of the line numbers for that file/context are in one numbits.         file_id integer,            -- foreign key to `file`.         context_id integer,         -- foreign key to `context`.         numbits blob,               -- see the numbits functions in coverage.numbits         foreign key (file_id) references file (id),         foreign key (context_id) references context (id),         unique (file_id, context_id)     );      CREATE TABLE arc (         -- If recording branches, a row per context per from/to line transition executed.         file_id integer,            -- foreign key to `file`.         context_id integer,         -- foreign key to `context`.         fromno integer,             -- line number jumped from.         tono integer,               -- line number jumped to.         foreign key (file_id) references file (id),         foreign key (context_id) references context (id),         unique (file_id, context_id, fromno, tono)     );      CREATE TABLE tracer (         -- A row per file indicating the tracer used for that file.         file_id integer primary key,         tracer text,         foreign key (file_id) references file (id)     );  ..

# Excluding code from coverage.py

You may have code in your project that you know won't be executed, and you want to tell coverage.py to ignore it. For example, you may have debugging-only code that won't be executed during your unit tests. You can tell coverage.py to exclude this code during reporting so that it doesn't clutter your reports with noise about code that you don't need to hear about.

Coverage.py will look for comments marking clauses for exclusion. In this code, the "if debug" clause is excluded from reporting:

``` python
a = my_function1()
if debug:  # pragma: no cover
    msg = "blah blah"
    log_message(msg, a)
b = my_function2()
```

By default, any line with a comment of `pragma: no cover` is excluded. If that line introduces a clause, for example, an `if` clause, or a function or class definition, then the entire clause is also excluded. Here the `__repr__` function is not reported as missing:

``` python
class MyObject(object):
    def __init__(self):
        blah1()
        blah2()

    def __repr__(self):  # pragma: no cover
        return "<MyObject>"
```

Excluded code is executed as usual, and its execution is recorded in the coverage data as usual. When producing reports though, coverage.py excludes it from the list of missing code.

## Branch coverage

When measuring \[branch coverage \<branch\>\](\#branch-coverage-\<branch\>), a conditional will not be counted as a branch if one of its choices is excluded:

``` python
def only_one_choice(x):
    if x:
        blah1()
        blah2()
    else:  # pragma: no cover
        # x is always true.
        blah3()
```

Because the `else` clause is excluded, the `if` only has one possible next line, so it isn't considered a branch at all.

## Advanced exclusion

Coverage.py identifies exclusions by matching source code against a list of regular expressions. Using \[configuration files \<config\>\](\#configuration-files-\<config\>) or the coverage \[API \<api\>\](\#api-\<api\>), you can add to that list. This is useful if you have often-used constructs to exclude that can be matched with a regex. You can exclude them all at once without littering your code with exclusion pragmas.

Before coverage.py 7.6.0, the regexes were matched against single lines of your source code. Now they can be multi-line regexes that find matches across lines. See \[multi\_line\_exclude\](\#multi\_line\_exclude).

If a matched line introduces a block, the entire block is excluded from reporting. Matching a `def` line or decorator line will exclude an entire function.

For example, you might decide that \_\_repr\_\_ functions are usually only used in debugging code, and are uninteresting to test themselves. You could exclude all of them by adding a regex to the exclusion list:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[report\] exclude\_also = def \_\_repr\_\_

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.report\] exclude\_also = \[ "def \_\_repr\_\_", \]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:report\] exclude\_also = def \_\_repr\_\_

</div>

</div>

For example, here's a list of exclusions I've used:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[report\] exclude\_also = def \_\_repr\_\_ if self.debug: if settings.DEBUG raise AssertionError raise NotImplementedError if 0: if \_\_name\_\_ == .\_\_main\_\_.: if TYPE\_CHECKING: class .\*bProtocol): @(abc.)?abstractmethod

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.report\] exclude\_also = \[ "def \_\_repr\_\_", "if self.debug:", "if settings.DEBUG", "raise AssertionError", "raise NotImplementedError", "if 0:", "if \_\_name\_\_ == .\_\_main\_\_.:", "if TYPE\_CHECKING:", "class .\*\\bProtocol\\):", "@(abc\\.)?abstractmethod", \]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:report\] exclude\_also = def \_\_repr\_\_ if self.debug: if settings.DEBUG raise AssertionError raise NotImplementedError if 0: if \_\_name\_\_ == .\_\_main\_\_.: if TYPE\_CHECKING: class .\*bProtocol): @(abc.)?abstractmethod

</div>

</div>

The \[config\_report\_exclude\_also\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_also) option adds regexes to the built-in default list so that you can add your own exclusions. The older \[config\_report\_exclude\_lines\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_lines) option completely overwrites the list of regexes.

The regexes only have to match part of a line. Be careful not to over-match. A value of `...` will match any line with more than three characters in it.

A similar pragma, "no branch", can be used to tailor branch coverage measurement. See \[branch\](\#branch) for details.

## Multi-line exclusion regexes

<div class="versionadded">

7.6.0

</div>

Exclusion regexes can match multi-line regions. All of the lines in a matched region will be excluded. If part of the region introduces a block, the entire block is excluded even if part of it is outside the matched region.

When writing regexes to match multiple lines, remember that `"."` won't match a newline character, but `"\n"` or `"(?s:.)"` will. The regexes in these settings are combined, so you cannot use global flags like `(?s)` in your regexes. Use the scoped flag form instead: `(?s:...)`

Here are some examples:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[report\] exclude\_also = ; 1. Exclude an except clause of a specific form: except ValueError:ns*assume(False) ; 2. Comments to turn coverage on and off: no cover: start(?s:.)*?no cover: stop ; 3. A pragma comment that excludes an entire file: A(?s:.*\# pragma: exclude file.*)Z

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.report\] exclude\_also = \[ \# 1. Exclude an except clause of a specific form: "except ValueError:\\n\\s\*assume\\(False\\)", \# 2. Comments to turn coverage on and off: "no cover: start(?s:.)*?no cover: stop", \# 3. A pragma comment that excludes an entire file: "\\A(?s:.*\# pragma: exclude file.\*)\\Z", \]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:report\] exclude\_also = ; 1. Exclude an except clause of a specific form: except ValueError:ns*assume(False) ; 2. Comments to turn coverage on and off: no cover: start(?s:.)*?no cover: stop ; 3. A pragma comment that excludes an entire file: A(?s:.*\# pragma: exclude file.*)Z

</div>

</div>

The first regex matches a specific except line followed by a specific function call. Both lines must be present for the exclusion to take effect. Note that the regex uses `"\n\s*"` to match the newline and the indentation of the second line. Without these, the regex won't match.

The second regex creates a pair of comments that can be used to exclude statements between them. All lines between `# no cover: start` and `# no cover: stop` will be excluded. The regex doesn't start with `#` because that's a comment in a .coveragerc file. Be careful with wildcards: we've used the non-greedy `*?` to match the fewest possible characters between the comments. If you used the greedy `*` instead, the star would match as many as possible, and you could accidentally exclude large swaths of code.

The third regex matches the entire text of a file containing the comment `# pragma: exclude file`. This lets you exclude files from coverage measurement with an internal comment instead of naming them in a settings file. This regex uses the `"(?s:...)"` regex flag to let a dot match any character including a newline.

# FAQ and other help

## Frequently asked questions

### Q: Why are some of my files not measured?

Coverage.py has a number of mechanisms for deciding which files to measure and which to skip. If your files aren't being measured, use the `--debug=trace` \[option \<cmd\_run\_debug\>\](\#option-\<cmd\_run\_debug\>), also settable as `[run] debug=trace` in the \[settings file \<config\_run\_debug\>\](\#settings-file-\<config\_run\_debug\>), or as `COVERAGE_DEBUG=trace` in an environment variable.

This will write a line for each file considered, indicating whether it is traced or not, and if not, why not. Be careful though: the output might be swallowed by your test runner. If so, a `COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE=/tmp/cov.out` environment variable can direct the output to a file instead to ensure you see everything.

### Q: Why do unexecutable lines show up as executed?

Usually this is because you've updated your code and run coverage.py on it again without erasing the old data. Coverage.py records line numbers executed, so the old data may have recorded a line number which has since moved, causing coverage.py to claim a line has been executed which cannot be.

If old data is persisting, you can use an explicit `coverage erase` command to clean out the old data.

### Q: Why are my function definitions marked as run when I haven't tested them?

The `def` and `class` lines in your Python file are executed when the file is imported. Those are the lines that define your functions and classes. They run even if you never call the functions. It's the body of the functions that will be marked as not executed if you don't test them, not the `def` lines.

This can mean that your code has a moderate coverage total even if no tests have been written or run. This might seem surprising, but it is accurate: the `def` lines have actually been run.

### Q: Why do the bodies of functions show as executed, but the def lines do not?

If this happens, it's because coverage.py has started after the functions are defined. The definition lines are executed without coverage measurement, then coverage.py is started, then the function is called. This means the body is measured, but the definition of the function itself is not.

The same thing can happen with the bodies of classes.

To fix this, start coverage.py earlier. If you use the \[command line \<cmd\>\](\#command-line \<cmd\>) to run your program with coverage.py, then your entire program will be monitored. If you are using the \[API \<api\>\](\#api-\<api\>), you need to call coverage.start() before importing the modules that define your functions.

### Q: My decorator lines are marked as covered, but the "def" line is not. Why?

Different versions of Python report execution on different lines. Coverage.py adapts its behavior to the version of Python being used. In Python 3.7 and earlier, a decorated function definition only reported the decorator as executed. In Python 3.8 and later, both the decorator and the "def" are reported. If you collect execution data on Python 3.7, and then run coverage reports on Python 3.8, there will be a discrepancy.

### Q: Can I find out which tests ran which lines?

Yes\! Coverage.py has a feature called \[dynamic\_contexts\](\#dynamic\_contexts) which can collect this information. Add this to your .coveragerc file:

`` `ini     [run]     dynamic_context = test_function  and then use the ``--contexts`option when generating an HTML report.   Q: How is the total percentage calculated?`\` ..........................................

Coverage.py counts the total number of possible executions. This is the number of executable statements minus the number of excluded statements. It then counts the number of those possibilities that were actually executed. The total percentage is the actual executions divided by the possible executions.

As an example, a coverage report with 1514 statements and 901 missed statements would calculate a total percentage of (1514-901)/1514, or 40.49%.

\[Branch coverage \<branch\>\](\#branch-coverage-\<branch\>) extends the calculation to include the total number of possible branch exits, and the number of those taken. In this case the specific numbers shown in coverage reports don't calculate out to the percentage shown, because the number of missing branch exits isn't reported explicitly. A branch line that wasn't executed at all is counted once as a missing statement in the report, instead of as two missing branches. Reports show the number of partial branches, which is the lines that were executed but did not execute all of their exits.

### Q: Coverage.py is much slower than I remember, what's going on?

Make sure you are using the C trace function. Coverage.py provides two implementations of the trace function. The C implementation runs much faster. To see what you are running, use `coverage debug sys`. The output contains details of the environment, including a line that says either `CTracer: available` or `CTracer: unavailable`. If it says unavailable, then you are using the slow Python implementation.

Try re-installing coverage.py to see what happened and if you get the CTracer as you should.

### Q: Isn't coverage testing the best thing ever?

It's good, but [it isn't perfect](https://nedbatchelder.com/blog/200710/flaws_in_coverage_measurement.html).

### Q: Where can I get more help with coverage.py?

You can discuss coverage.py or get help using it on the [Python discussion forums](https://discuss.python.org/) or in the [Python Discord](https://discord.com/channels/267624335836053506/1253355750684753950). If you ping me (`@nedbat`), there's a higher chance I'll see the post.

Bug reports are gladly accepted at the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues).

[I can be reached](https://nedbatchelder.com/site/aboutned.html) in a number of ways. I'm happy to answer questions about using coverage.py.

# How coverage.py works

For advanced use of coverage.py, or just because you are curious, it helps to understand what's happening behind the scenes.

Coverage.py works in three phases:

  - **Execution**: Coverage.py runs your code, and monitors it to see what lines were executed.
  - **Analysis**: Coverage.py examines your code to determine what lines could have run.
  - **Reporting**: Coverage.py combines the results of execution and analysis to produce a coverage number and an indication of missing execution.

The execution phase is handled by the `coverage run` command. The analysis and reporting phases are handled by the reporting commands like `coverage report` or `coverage html`.

As a short-hand, I say that coverage.py measures what lines were executed. But it collects more information than that. It can measure what branches were taken, and if you have contexts enabled, for each line or branch, it will also measure what contexts they were executed in.

Let's look at each phase in more detail.

## Execution

At the heart of the execution phase is a trace function. This is a function that the Python interpreter invokes for each line executed in a program. Coverage.py implements a trace function that records each file and line number as it is executed.

For more details of trace functions, see the Python docs for [sys.settrace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace), or if you are really brave, [How C trace functions really work](https://nedbatchelder.com/text/trace-function.html).

Executing a function for every line in your program can make execution very slow. Coverage.py's trace function is implemented in C to reduce that overhead. It also takes care to not trace code that you aren't interested in.

When measuring branch coverage, the same trace function is used, but instead of recording line numbers, coverage.py records pairs of line numbers. Each invocation of the trace function remembers the line number, then the next invocation records the pair <span class="title-ref">(prev, this)</span> to indicate that execution transitioned from the previous line to this line. Internally, these are called arcs.

As the data is being collected, coverage.py writes the data to a file, usually named `.coverage`. This is a \[SQLite database \<dbschema\>\](\#sqlite-database-\<dbschema\>) containing all of the measured data.

### Plugins

Of course coverage.py mostly measures execution of Python files. But it can also be used to analyze other kinds of execution. \[File tracer plugins \<file\_tracer\_plugins\>\](\#file-tracer-plugins \<file\_tracer\_plugins\>) provide support for non-Python files. For example, Django HTML templates result in Python code being executed somewhere, but as a developer, you want that execution mapped back to your .html template file.

During execution, each new Python file encountered is provided to the plugins to consider. A plugin can claim the file and then convert the runtime Python execution into source-level data to be recorded.

### Dynamic contexts

When using \[dynamic contexts \<dynamic\_contexts\>\](\#dynamic-contexts-\<dynamic\_contexts\>), there is a current dynamic context that changes over the course of execution. It starts as empty. While it is empty, every time a new function is entered, a check is made to see if the dynamic context should change. While a non-empty dynamic context is current, the check is skipped until the function that started the context returns.

## Analysis

After your program has been executed and the line numbers recorded, coverage.py needs to determine what lines could have been executed. Luckily, compiled Python files (.pyc files) have a table of line numbers in them. Coverage.py reads this table to get the set of executable lines, with a little more source analysis to leave out things like docstrings.

The data file is read to get the set of lines that were executed. The difference between the executable lines and the executed lines are the lines that were not executed.

The same principle applies for branch measurement, though the process for determining possible branches is more involved. Coverage.py uses the abstract syntax tree of the Python source file to determine the set of possible branches.

## Reporting

Once we have the set of executed lines and missing lines, reporting is a matter of formatting that information in a useful way. Each reporting method (text, HTML, JSON, annotated source, XML) has a different output format, but the process is the same: write out the information in the particular format, possibly including the source code itself.

# Coverage.py

Coverage.py is a tool for measuring code coverage of Python programs. It monitors your program, noting which parts of the code have been executed, then analyzes the source to identify code that could have been executed but was not.

Coverage measurement is typically used to gauge the effectiveness of tests. It can show which parts of your code are being exercised by tests, and which are not.

The latest version is coverage.py , released . It is supported on:

  - Python 3.9 through 3.14 alpha 1, including free-threading.
  - PyPy3 versions 3.9 and 3.10.

<div class="ifconfig">

prerelease

**This is a pre-release build. The usual warnings about possible bugs apply.** The latest stable version is coverage.py 6.5.0, [described here](http://coverage.readthedocs.io/).

## For Enterprise

[![Tidelift](media/Tidelift_Logos_RGB_Tidelift_Shorthand_On-White.png)](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-coverage?utm_source=pypi-coverage&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=readme)

[Available as part of the Tidelift Subscription.](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-coverage?utm_source=pypi-coverage&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=docs) Coverage and thousands of other packages are working with Tidelift to deliver one enterprise subscription that covers all of the open source you use. If you want the flexibility of open source and the confidence of commercial-grade software, this is for you. [Learn more. \<Tidelift Subscription\_\>]()

## Quick start

Getting started is easy:

1.  Install coverage.py:
    
        $ python3 -m pip install coverage
    
    For more details, see \[install\](\#install).

<!-- end list -->

  - \#. Use `coverage run` to run your test suite and gather data. However you  
    normally run your test suite, you can use your test runner under coverage.
    
    <div class="tip">
    
    <div class="title">
    
    Tip
    
    </div>
    
    If your test runner command starts with "python", replace the initial "python" with "coverage run".
    
    `python something.py` becomes `coverage run something.py`
    
    `python -m amodule` becomes `coverage run -m amodule`
    
    </div>
    
    Other instructions for specific test runners:
    
    <div class="tabs">
    
    <div class="tab">
    
    pytest
    
    If you usually use:
    
        $ pytest arg1 arg2 arg3
    
    then you can run your tests under coverage with:
    
        $ coverage run -m pytest arg1 arg2 arg3
    
    Many people choose to use the [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/) plugin, but for most purposes, it is unnecessary.
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab">
    
    unittest
    
    Change "python" to "coverage run", so this:
    
        $ python3 -m unittest discover
    
    becomes:
    
        $ coverage run -m unittest discover
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="tab">
    
    nosetest
    
    <div class="note">
    
    <div class="title">
    
    Note
    
    </div>
    
    Nose has been [unmaintained since at least 2015](https://github.com/nose-devs/nose/commit/0f40fa995384afad77e191636c89eb7d5b8870ca). *You should seriously consider using a different test runner.*
    
    </div>
    
    Change this:
    
        $ nosetests arg1 arg2
    
    to:
    
        $ coverage run -m nose arg1 arg2
    
    </div>
    
    </div>
    
    Coverage doesn't distinguish between tests and the code being tested. We [recommend that you include your tests in coverage measurement \<include tests\_\>]().
    
    To limit coverage measurement to code in the current directory, and also find files that weren't executed at all, add the `--source=.` argument to your coverage command line. You can also \[specify source files to measure \<source\>\](\#specify-source-files-to

\----measure-\<source\>) or \[exclude code from measurement \<excluding\>\](\#exclude-code-from-measurement-\<excluding\>).

1.  Use `coverage report` to report on the results:
    
        $ coverage report -m
        Name                      Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
        -------------------------------------------------------
        my_program.py                20      4    80%   33-35, 39
        my_other_module.py           56      6    89%   17-23
        -------------------------------------------------------
        TOTAL                        76     10    87%

2.  For a nicer presentation, use `coverage html` to get annotated HTML listings detailing missed lines:
    
        $ coverage html
    
    <div class="ifconfig">
    
    not prerelease
    
    Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser, to see a [report like this](https://nedbatchelder.com/files/sample_coverage_html/index.html).
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="ifconfig">
    
    prerelease
    
    Then open htmlcov/index.html in your browser, to see a [report like this one](https://nedbatchelder.com/files/sample_coverage_html_beta/index.html).
    
    </div>

## Capabilities

Coverage.py can do a number of things:

  - By default it will measure line (statement) coverage.
  - It can also measure \[branch coverage \<branch\>\](\#branch-coverage-\<branch\>).
  - It can tell you \[what tests ran which lines \<dynamic\_contexts\>\](\#what-tests-ran-which-lines-\<dynamic\_contexts\>).
  - It can produce reports in a number of formats: \[text \<cmd\_report\>\](\#text-\<cmd\_report\>), \[HTML \<cmd\_html\>\](\#html-\<cmd\_html\>), \[XML \<cmd\_xml\>\](\#xml-\<cmd\_xml\>), \[LCOV \<cmd\_lcov\>\](\#lcov-\<cmd\_lcov\>), and \[JSON \<cmd\_json\>\](\#json-\<cmd\_json\>).
  - For advanced uses, there's an \[API \<api\>\](\#api-\<api\>), and the result data is available in a \[SQLite database \<dbschema\>\](\#sqlite-database-\<dbschema\>).

## Using coverage.py

There are a few different ways to use coverage.py. The simplest is the \[command line \<cmd\>\](\#command-line-\<cmd\>), which lets you run your program and see the results. If you need more control over how your project is measured, you can use the \[API \<api\>\](\#api-\<api\>).

Some test runners provide coverage integration to make it easy to use coverage.py while running tests. For example, [pytest](http://doc.pytest.org) has the [pytest-cov](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/) plugin.

You can fine-tune coverage.py's view of your code by directing it to ignore parts that you know aren't interesting. See \[source\](\#source) and \[excluding\](\#excluding) for details.

# Installation

You can install coverage.py in the usual ways. The simplest way is with pip:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install coverage
```

<div class="ifconfig">

prerelease

To install a pre-release version, you will need to specify `--pre`:

``` console
$ python3 -m pip install --pre coverage
```

or the exact version you want to install:

<div class="parsed-literal">

$ python3 -m pip install

</div>

</div>

## C Extension

Coverage.py includes a C extension for speed. It is strongly recommended to use this extension: it is much faster, and is needed to support a number of coverage.py features. Most of the time, the C extension will be installed without any special action on your part.

You can determine if you are using the extension by looking at the output of `coverage --version`:

<div class="parsed-literal">

$ coverage --version Coverage.py, version with C extension Documentation at

</div>

The first line will either say "with C extension," or "without C extension."

If you are missing the extension, first make sure you have the latest version of pip in use when installing coverage.

If you are installing on Linux, you may need to install the python-dev and gcc support files before installing coverage via pip. The exact commands depend on which package manager you use, which Python version you are using, and the names of the packages for your distribution. For example:

``` console
$ sudo apt-get install python-dev gcc
$ sudo yum install python-devel gcc

$ sudo apt-get install python3-dev gcc
$ sudo yum install python3-devel gcc
```

A few features of coverage.py aren't supported without the C extension, such as concurrency and plugins.

## Checking the installation

If all went well, you should be able to open a command prompt, and see coverage.py installed properly:

<div class="parsed-literal">

$ coverage --version Coverage.py, version with C extension Documentation at

</div>

You can also invoke coverage.py as a module:

<div class="parsed-literal">

$ python3 -m coverage --version Coverage.py, version with C extension Documentation at

</div>

# Migrating between versions

New versions of coverage.py or Python might require you to adjust your settings, options, or other aspects of how you use coverage.py. This page details those changes.

## Migrating to coverage.py 7.x

Consider these changes when migrating to coverage.py 7.x:

  - The way that wildcards when specifying file paths work in certain cases has changed in 7.x:
      - Previously, `*` would incorrectly match directory separators, making precise matching difficult. Patterns such as `*tests/*` will need to be changed to `*/tests/*`.
      - `**` now matches any number of nested directories. If you wish to retain the behavior of `**/tests/*` in previous versions then `*/**/tests/*` can be used instead.
  - When remapping file paths with `[paths]`, a path will be remapped only if the resulting path exists. Ensure that remapped `[paths]` exist when upgrading as this is now being enforced.
  - The \[config\_report\_exclude\_also\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_also) setting is new in 7.2.0. It adds exclusion regexes while keeping the default built-in set. It's better than the older \[config\_report\_exclude\_lines\](\#config\_report\_exclude\_lines) setting, which overwrote the entire list. Newer versions of coverage.py will be adding to the default set of exclusions. Using `exclude_also` will let you benefit from those updates.

## Migrating to coverage.py 6.2

  - The `--concurrency` settings changed in 6.2 to be a list of values. You might need to explicitly list concurrency options that we previously implied. For example, `--concurrency=multiprocessing` used to implicitly enable thread concurrency. Now that must be explicitly enabled with `--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread`.

## Migrating to Python 3.12

Keep these things in mind when running under Python 3.12:

  - Python 3.12 now inlines list, dict, and set comprehensions. Previously, they were compiled as functions that were called internally. Coverage.py would warn you if comprehensions weren't fully completed, but this no longer happens with Python 3.12.

# Plug-ins

Coverage.py's behavior can be extended with third-party plug-ins. A plug-in is a separately installed Python class that you register in your .coveragerc. Plugins can alter a number of aspects of coverage.py's behavior, including implementing coverage measurement for non-Python files.

Information about using plug-ins is on this page. To write a plug-in, see \[api\_plugin\](\#api\_plugin).

See \[other\](\#other) for available plug-ins.

<div class="versionadded">

4.0

</div>

## Using plug-ins

To use a coverage.py plug-in, you install it and configure it. For this example, let's say there's a Python package called `something` that provides a coverage.py plug-in called `something.plugin`.

1.  Install the plug-in's package as you would any other Python package:
    
      - \`\`\`sh  
        $ python3 -m pip install something

2.  Configure coverage.py to use the plug-in. You do this by editing (or creating) your .coveragerc file, as described in \[config\](\#config). The `plugins` setting indicates your plug-in. It's a list of importable module names of plug-ins:
    
    <div class="tabs">
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">
    
    ini
    
    \[run\] plugins = something.plugin
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">
    
    toml
    
    \[tool.coverage.run\] plugins = \[ "something.plugin" \]
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">
    
    ini
    
    \[coverage:run\] plugins = something.plugin
    
    </div>
    
    </div>

3.  If the plug-in needs its own configuration, you can add those settings in the .coveragerc file in a section named for the plug-in:
    
    <div class="tabs">
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">
    
    ini
    
    \[something.plugin\] option1 = True option2 = abc.foo
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">
    
    toml
    
    \[tool.coverage.something.plugin\] option1 = true option2 = "abc.foo"
    
    </div>
    
    <div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">
    
    ini
    
    \[coverage:something.plugin\] option1 = True option2 = abc.foo
    
    </div>
    
    </div>
    
    Check the documentation for the plug-in for details on the options it takes.

<!-- end list -->

  - \#. Run your tests with coverage.py as you usually would. If you get a message  
    like "Plugin file tracers (something.plugin) aren't supported with PyTracer," then you don't have the \[C extension \<install\_extension\>\](\#c-extension-\<install\_extension\>) installed. The C extension is needed for certain plug-ins.

# Specifying source files

When coverage.py is running your program and measuring its execution, it needs to know what code to measure and what code not to. Measurement imposes a speed penalty, and the collected data must be stored in memory and then on disk. More importantly, when reviewing your coverage reports, you don't want to be distracted with modules that aren't your concern.

Coverage.py has a number of ways you can focus it in on the code you care about.

## Execution

When running your code, the `coverage run` command will by default measure all code, unless it is part of the Python standard library.

You can specify source to measure with the `--source` command-line switch, or the `[run] source` configuration value. The value is a comma- or newline-separated list of directories or importable names (packages or modules).

If the source option is specified, only code in those locations will be measured. Specifying the source option also enables coverage.py to report on un-executed files, since it can search the source tree for files that haven't been measured at all. Only importable files (ones at the root of the tree, or in directories with a `__init__.py` file) will be considered. Files with unusual punctuation in their names will be skipped (they are assumed to be scratch files written by text editors). Files that do not end with `.py`, `.pyw`, `.pyo`, or `.pyc` will also be skipped.

\> **Note** \> Modules named as sources may be imported twice, once by coverage.py to find their location, then again by your own code or test suite. Usually this isn't a problem, but could cause trouble if a module has side-effects at import time.

> Exceptions during the early import are suppressed and ignored.

You can further fine-tune coverage.py's attention with the `--include` and `--omit` switches (or `[run] include` and `[run] omit` configuration values). `--include` is a list of file name patterns. If specified, only files matching those patterns will be measured. `--omit` is also a list of file name patterns, specifying files not to measure. If both `include` and `omit` are specified, first the set of files is reduced to only those that match the include patterns, then any files that match the omit pattern are removed from the set.

The `include` and `omit` file name patterns follow common shell syntax, described below in \[source\_glob\](\#source\_glob). Patterns that start with a wildcard character are used as-is, other patterns are interpreted relative to the current directory:

<div class="tabs">

<div class="code-tab" data-caption=".coveragerc">

ini

\[run\] omit = \# omit anything in a .local directory anywhere */.local/* \# omit everything in /usr /usr/\* \# omit this single file utils/tirefire.py

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="pyproject.toml">

toml

\[tool.coverage.run\] omit = \[ \# omit anything in a .local directory anywhere "*/.local/*", \# omit everything in /usr "/usr/\*", \# omit this single file "utils/tirefire.py", \]

</div>

<div class="code-tab" data-caption="setup.cfg or tox.ini">

ini

\[coverage:run\] omit = \# omit anything in a .local directory anywhere */.local/* \# omit everything in /usr /usr/\* \# omit this single file utils/tirefire.py

</div>

</div>

The `source`, `include`, and `omit` values all work together to determine the source that will be measured.

If both `source` and `include` are set, the `include` value is ignored and a warning is issued.

## Reporting

Once your program is measured, you can specify the source files you want reported. Usually you want to see all the code that was measured, but if you are measuring a large project, you may want to get reports for just certain parts.

The report commands (`report`, `html`, `json`, `lcov`, `annotate`, and `xml`) all take optional `modules` arguments, and `--include` and `--omit` switches. The `modules` arguments specify particular modules to report on. The `include` and `omit` values are lists of file name patterns, just as with the `run` command.

Remember that the reporting commands can only report on the data that has been collected, so the data you're looking for may not be in the data available for reporting.

Note that these are ways of specifying files to measure. You can also exclude individual source lines. See \[excluding\](\#excluding) for details.

## File patterns

File path patterns are used for \[include \<config\_run\_include\>\](\#include-\<config\_run\_include\>) and \[omit \<config\_run\_omit\>\](\#omit-\<config\_run\_omit\>), and for \[combining path remapping \<cmd\_combine\_remapping\>\](\#combining-path-remapping \<cmd\_combine\_remapping\>). They follow common shell syntax:

  - `?` matches a single file name character.
  - `*` matches any number of file name characters, not including the directory separator. As a special case, if a pattern starts with `*/`, it is treated as `**/`, and if a pattern ends with `/*`, it is treated as `/**`.
  - `**` matches any number of nested directory names, including none. It must be used as a full component of the path, not as part of a word: `/**/` is allowed, but `/a**/` is not.
  - Both `/` and `\` will match either a slash or a backslash, to make cross-platform matching easier.
  - A pattern with no directory separators matches the file name in any directory.

# Measuring sub-processes

Complex test suites may spawn sub-processes to run tests, either to run them in parallel, or because sub-process behavior is an important part of the system under test. Measuring coverage in those sub-processes can be tricky because you have to modify the code spawning the process to invoke coverage.py.

There's an easier way to do it: coverage.py includes a function, <span class="title-ref">coverage.process\_startup</span> designed to be invoked when Python starts. It examines the `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` environment variable, and if it is set, begins coverage measurement. The environment variable's value will be used as the name of the \[configuration file \<config\>\](\#configuration-file-\<config\>) to use.

\> **Note** \> The subprocess only sees options in the configuration file. Options set on the command line will not be used in the subprocesses.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If you have subprocesses created with `multiprocessing
<python:multiprocessing>`, the `--concurrency=multiprocessing` command-line option should take care of everything for you. See \[cmd\_run\](\#cmd\_run) for details.

</div>

When using this technique, be sure to set the parallel option to true so that multiple coverage.py runs will each write their data to a distinct file.

## Configuring Python for sub-process measurement

Measuring coverage in sub-processes is a little tricky. When you spawn a sub-process, you are invoking Python to run your program. Usually, to get coverage measurement, you have to use coverage.py to run your program. Your sub-process won't be using coverage.py, so we have to convince Python to use coverage.py even when not explicitly invoked.

To do that, we'll configure Python to run a little coverage.py code when it starts. That code will look for an environment variable that tells it to start coverage measurement at the start of the process.

To arrange all this, you have to do two things: set a value for the `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` environment variable, and then configure Python to invoke <span class="title-ref">coverage.process\_startup</span> when Python processes start.

How you set `COVERAGE_PROCESS_START` depends on the details of how you create sub-processes. As long as the environment variable is visible in your sub-process, it will work.

You can configure your Python installation to invoke the `process_startup` function in two ways:

1.  Create or append to sitecustomize.py to add these lines:
    
        import coverage
        coverage.process_startup()

2.  Create a .pth file in your Python installation containing:
    
        import coverage; coverage.process_startup()

The sitecustomize.py technique is cleaner, but may involve modifying an existing sitecustomize.py, since there can be only one. If there is no sitecustomize.py already, you can create it in any directory on the Python path.

The .pth technique seems like a hack, but works, and is documented behavior. On the plus side, you can create the file with any name you like so you don't have to coordinate with other .pth files. On the minus side, you have to create the file in a system-defined directory, so you may need privileges to write it.

Note that if you use one of these techniques, you must undo them if you uninstall coverage.py, since you will be trying to import it during Python start-up. Be sure to remove the change when you uninstall coverage.py, or use a more defensive approach to importing it.

## Process termination

To successfully write a coverage data file, the Python sub-process under analysis must shut down cleanly and have a chance for coverage.py to run its termination code. It will do that when the process ends naturally, or when a SIGTERM signal is received.

Coverage.py uses `atexit <python:atexit>` to handle usual process ends, and a `signal <python:signal>` handler to catch SIGTERM signals.

Other ways of ending a process, like SIGKILL or <span class="title-ref">os.\_exit \<python:os.\_exit\></span>, will prevent coverage.py from writing its data file, leaving you with incomplete or non-existent coverage data.

# Things that cause trouble

Coverage.py works well, and I want it to properly measure any Python program, but there are some situations it can't cope with. This page details some known problems, with possible courses of action, and links to coverage.py bug reports with more information.

I would love to \[hear from you \<contact\>\](\#hear-from-you-\<contact\>) if you have information about any of these problems, even just to explain to me why you want them to start working properly.

If your problem isn't discussed here, you can of course search the [coverage.py bug tracker](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues) directly to see if there is some mention of it.

## Things that don't work

There are a few modules or functions that prevent coverage.py from working properly:

  - [execv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.execl), or one of its variants. These end the current program and replace it with a new one. This doesn't save the collected coverage data, so your program that calls execv will not be fully measured. A patch for coverage.py is in [issue 43](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/43).
  - [thread](https://docs.python.org/3/library/_thread.html), in the Python standard library, is the low-level threading interface. Threads created with this module will not be traced. Use the higher-level [threading](https://docs.python.org/3/library/threading.html) module instead.
  - [sys.settrace](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.settrace) is the Python feature that coverage.py uses to see what's happening in your program. If another part of your program is using sys.settrace, then it will conflict with coverage.py, and it won't be measured properly.
  - [sys.setprofile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sys.html#sys.setprofile) calls your code, but while running your code, does not fire trace events. This means that coverage.py can't see what's happening in that code.

## Still having trouble?

If your problem isn't mentioned here, and isn't already reported in the [coverage.py bug tracker](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues), please \[get in touch with me \<contact\>\](\#get-in-touch-with-me-\<contact\>), we'll figure out a solution.

# Major changes in 5.0

This is an overview of the changes in 5.0 since the last version of 4.5.x. This is not a complete list of all changes. See the \[complete change history \<changes\>\](\#complete-change-history \<changes\>) for all the details.

## Open Questions

  - How to support SQL access to data? The database schema has to be convenient and efficient for coverage.py's execution, which would naturally make it an internal implementation detail. But the coverage data is now more complex, and SQL access could be a powerful way to access it, pointing toward a public guaranteed schema. What's the right balance?

## Backward Incompatibilities

  - Python 2.6, 3.3 and 3.4 are no longer supported.
  - The <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> interface is still public, but has changed.
  - The data file is now created earlier than it used to be. In some circumstances, you may need to use `parallel=true` to avoid multiple processes overwriting each others' data.
  - When constructing a <span class="title-ref">coverage.Coverage</span> object, <span class="title-ref">data\_file</span> can be specified as None to prevent writing any data file at all. In previous versions, an explicit <span class="title-ref">data\_file=None</span> argument would use the default of ".coverage". Fixes [issue 871](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/871).
  - The `[run] note` setting has been deprecated. Using it will result in a warning, and the note will not be written to the data file. The corresponding <span class="title-ref">.CoverageData</span> methods have been removed.
  - The deprecated <span class="title-ref">Reporter.file\_reporters</span> property has been removed.
  - The reporting methods used to permanently apply their arguments to the configuration of the Coverage object. Now they no longer do. The arguments affect the operation of the method, but do not persist.
  - Many internal attributes and functions were changed. These were not part of the public supported API. If your code used them, it might now stop working.

## New Features

  - Coverage.py can now record the context in which each line was executed. The contexts are stored in the data file and can be used to drill down into why a particular line was run. Static contexts let you specify a label for an entire coverage run, for example to separate coverage for different operating systems or versions of Python. Dynamic contexts can change during a single measurement run. This can be used to record the names of the tests that executed each line. See \[contexts\](\#contexts) for full information.
  - Coverage's data storage has changed. In version 4.x, .coverage files were basically JSON. Now, they are SQLite databases. The database schema is documented (\[dbschema\](\#dbschema)), but might still be in flux.
  - Data can now be "reported" in JSON format, for programmatic use, as requested in [issue 720](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/720). The new `coverage json` command writes raw and summarized data to a JSON file. Thanks, Matt Bachmann.
  - Configuration can now be read from [TOML](https://toml.io/) files. This requires installing coverage.py with the `[toml]` extra. The standard "pyproject.toml" file will be read automatically if no other configuration file is found, with settings in the `[tool.coverage.]` namespace. Thanks to Frazer McLean for implementation and persistence. Finishes [issue 664](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/664).
  - The HTML and textual reports now have a `--skip-empty` option that skips files with no statements, notably `__init__.py` files. Thanks, Reya B.
  - You can specify the command line to run your program with the `[run] command_line` configuration setting, as requested in [issue 695](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/695).
  - An experimental `[run] relative_files` setting tells coverage to store relative file names in the data file. This makes it easier to run tests in one (or many) environments, and then report in another. It has not had much real-world testing, so it may change in incompatible ways in the future.
  - Environment variable substitution in configuration files now supports two syntaxes for controlling the behavior of undefined variables: if `VARNAME` is not defined, `${VARNAME?}` will raise an error, and `${VARNAME-default value}` will use "default value".
  - The location of the configuration file can now be specified with a `COVERAGE_RCFILE` environment variable, as requested in [issue 650](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/650).
  - A new warning (`already-imported`) is issued if measurable files have already been imported before coverage.py started measurement. See \[cmd\_warnings\](\#cmd\_warnings) for more information.
  - Error handling during reporting has changed slightly. All reporting methods now behave the same. The `--ignore-errors` option keeps errors from stopping the reporting, but files that couldn't parse as Python will always be reported as warnings. As with other warnings, you can suppress them with the `[run] disable_warnings` configuration setting.
  - Added the classmethod <span class="title-ref">.Coverage.current</span> to get the latest started Coverage instance.

## Bugs Fixed

  - The `coverage run` command has always adjusted the first entry in sys.path, to properly emulate how Python runs your program. Now this adjustment is skipped if sys.path\[0\] is already different than Python's default. This fixes [issue 715](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/715).
  - Python files run with `-m` now have `__spec__` defined properly. This fixes [issue 745](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/745) (about not being able to run unittest tests that spawn subprocesses), and [issue 838](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/838), which described the problem directly.
  - Coverage will create directories as needed for the data file if they don't exist, closing [issue 721](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/721).
  - `fail_under` values more than 100 are reported as errors. Thanks to Mike Fiedler for closing [issue 746](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/746).
  - The "missing" values in the text output are now sorted by line number, so that missing branches are reported near the other lines they affect. The values used to show all missing lines, and then all missing branches.
  - Coverage.py no longer fails if the user program deletes its current directory. Fixes [issue 806](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/806). Thanks, Dan Hemberger.

Change history for coverage.py
==============================

These changes are listed in decreasing version number order. Note this can be different from a strict chronological order when there are two branches in development at the same time, such as 4.5.x and 5.0.

See `migrating`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} for significant changes that might be required when upgrading your version of coverage.py.

Unreleased
----------

Nothing yet.

Version 7.6.7 --- 2024-11-15 {#changes_7-6-7}
----------------------------

-   fix: ugh, the other assert from 7.6.5 can also be encountered in the wild, so it\'s been restored to a conditional. Sorry for the churn.

Version 7.6.6 --- 2024-11-15 {#changes_7-6-6}
----------------------------

-   One of the new asserts from 7.6.5 caused problems in real projects, as reported in [issue 1891](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1891). The assert has been removed.

Version 7.6.5 --- 2024-11-14 {#changes_7-6-5}
----------------------------

-   fix: fine-tuned the exact Python version (3.12.6) when exiting from `with` statements changed how they traced. This affected whether people saw the fix for [issue 1880](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1880).
-   fix: isolate our code more from mocking in the os module that in rare cases can cause [bizarre behavior](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/666).
-   refactor: some code unreachable code paths in parser.py were changed to asserts. If you encounter any of these, please let me know!

Version 7.6.4 --- 2024-10-20 {#changes_7-6-4}
----------------------------

-   fix: multi-line `with` statements could cause contained branches to be incorrectly marked as missing ([issue 1880](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1880)). This is now fixed.

Version 7.6.3 --- 2024-10-13 {#changes_7-6-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix: nested context managers could incorrectly be analyzed to flag a missing branch on the last context manager, as described in [issue 1876](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1876). This is now fixed.
-   Fix: the missing branch message about not exiting a module had an extra \"didn\'t,\" as described in [issue 1873](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1873). This is now fixed.

Version 7.6.2 --- 2024-10-09 {#changes_7-6-2}
----------------------------

-   Dropped support for Python 3.8 and PyPy 3.8.
-   Fix: a final wildcard match/case clause assigning to a name (`case _ as value`) was incorrectly marked as a missing branch. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1860](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1860).
-   Fewer things are considered branches now. Lambdas, comprehensions, and generator expressions are no longer marked as missing branches if they don\'t complete execution. Closes [issue 1852](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1852).
-   Fix: the HTML report didn\'t properly show multi-line f-strings that end with a backslash continuation. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1836](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1836), thanks to [LiuYinCarl and Marco Ricci](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1838).
-   Fix: the LCOV report now has correct line numbers (fixing [issue 1846](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1846)) and better branch descriptions for BRDA records (fixing [issue 1850](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1850)). There are other changes to lcov also, including a new configuration option `line_checksums <config_lcov_line_checksums>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to control whether line checksums are included in the lcov report. The default is false. To keep checksums set it to true. All this work is thanks to Zack Weinberg ([pull 1849](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1849) and [pull 1851](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1851)).
-   Fixed the docs for multi-line regex exclusions, closing [issue 1863](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1863).
-   Fixed a potential crash in the C tracer, closing [issue 1835](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1835), thanks to [Jan Kühle](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1843).

Version 7.6.1 --- 2024-08-04 {#changes_7-6-1}
----------------------------

-   Fix: coverage used to fail when measuring code using `runpy.run_path
    <python:runpy.run_path>`{.interpreted-text role="func"} with a `Path <python:pathlib.Path>`{.interpreted-text role="class"} argument. This is now fixed, thanks to [Ask Hjorth Larsen](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1819).
-   Fix: backslashes preceding a multi-line backslashed string could confuse the HTML report. This is now fixed, thanks to [LiuYinCarl](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1828).
-   Now we publish wheels for Python 3.13, both regular and free-threaded.

Version 7.6.0 --- 2024-07-11 {#changes_7-6-0}
----------------------------

-   Exclusion patterns can now be multi-line, thanks to [Daniel Diniz \<pull 1807\_\>](). This enables many interesting exclusion use-cases, including those requested in issues [118](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/118) (entire files), [996](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/996) (multiple lines only when appearing together), [1741](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1741) (remainder of a function), and [1803](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1803) (arbitrary sequence of marked lines). See the `multi_line_exclude`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} section of the docs for more details and examples.
-   The JSON report now includes per-function and per-class coverage information. Thanks to [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1809) for getting the work started. This closes [issue 1793](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1793) and [issue 1532](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1532).
-   Fixed an incorrect calculation of \"(no class)\" lines in the HTML classes report.
-   Python 3.13.0b3 is supported.

Version 7.5.4 --- 2024-06-22 {#changes_7-5-4}
----------------------------

-   If you attempt to combine statement coverage data with branch coverage data, coverage.py used to fail with the message \"Can\'t combine arc data with line data\" or its reverse, \"Can\'t combine line data with arc data.\" These messages used internal terminology, making it hard for people to understand the problem. They are now changed to mention \"branch coverage data\" and \"statement coverage data.\"
-   Fixed a minor branch coverage problem with wildcard match/case cases using names or guard clauses.
-   Started testing on 3.13 free-threading (nogil) builds of Python. I\'m not claiming full support yet. Closes [issue 1799](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1799).

Version 7.5.3 --- 2024-05-28 {#changes_7-5-3}
----------------------------

-   Performance improvements for combining data files, especially when measuring line coverage. A few different quadratic behaviors were eliminated. In one extreme case of combining 700+ data files, the time dropped from more than three hours to seven minutes. Thanks for Kraken Tech for funding the fix.
-   Performance improvements for generating HTML reports, with a side benefit of reducing memory use, closing [issue 1791](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1791). Thanks to Daniel Diniz for helping to diagnose the problem.

Version 7.5.2 --- 2024-05-24 {#changes_7-5-2}
----------------------------

-   Fix: nested matches of exclude patterns could exclude too much code, as reported in [issue 1779](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1779). This is now fixed.
-   Changed: previously, coverage.py would consider a module docstring to be an executable statement if it appeared after line 1 in the file, but not executable if it was the first line. Now module docstrings are never counted as executable statements. This can change coverage.py\'s count of the number of statements in a file, which can slightly change the coverage percentage reported.
-   In the HTML report, the filter term and \"hide covered\" checkbox settings are remembered between viewings, thanks to [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1776).
-   Python 3.13.0b1 is supported.
-   Fix: parsing error handling is improved to ensure bizarre source files are handled gracefully, and to unblock oss-fuzz fuzzing, thanks to [Liam DeVoe](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1788). Closes [issue 1787](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1787).

Version 7.5.1 --- 2024-05-04 {#changes_7-5-1}
----------------------------

-   Fix: a pragma comment on the continuation lines of a multi-line statement now excludes the statement and its body, the same as if the pragma is on the first line. This closes [issue 754](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/754). The fix was contributed by [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1773).
-   Fix: very complex source files like [this one](https://github.com/sympy/sympy/blob/130950f3e6b3f97fcc17f4599ac08f70fdd2e9d4/sympy/polys/numberfields/resolvent_lookup.py) could cause a maximum recursion error when creating an HTML report. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1774](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1774).
-   HTML report improvements:
    -   Support files (JavaScript and CSS) referenced by the HTML report now have hashes added to their names to ensure updated files are used instead of stale cached copies.
    -   Missing branch coverage explanations that said \"the condition was never false\" now read \"the condition was always true\" because it\'s easier to understand.
    -   Column sort order is remembered better as you move between the index pages, fixing [issue 1766](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1766). Thanks, [Daniel Diniz](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1768).

Version 7.5.0 --- 2024-04-23 {#changes_7-5-0}
----------------------------

-   Added initial support for function and class reporting in the HTML report. There are now three index pages which link to each other: files, functions, and classes. Other reports don\'t yet have this information, but it will be added in the future where it makes sense. Feedback gladly accepted! Finishes [issue 780](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/780).
-   Other HTML report improvements:
    -   There is now a \"hide covered\" checkbox to filter out 100% files, finishing [issue 1384](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1384).
    -   The index page is always sorted by one of its columns, with clearer indications of the sorting.
    -   The \"previous file\" shortcut key didn\'t work on the index page, but now it does, fixing [issue 1765](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1765).
-   The debug output showing which configuration files were tried now shows absolute paths to help diagnose problems where settings aren\'t taking effect, and is renamed from \"attempted\_config\_files\" to the more logical \"config\_files\_attempted.\"
-   Python 3.13.0a6 is supported.

Version 7.4.4 --- 2024-03-14 {#changes_7-4-4}
----------------------------

-   Fix: in some cases, even with `[run] relative_files=True`, a data file could be created with absolute path names. When combined with other relative data files, it was random whether the absolute file names would be made relative or not. If they weren\'t, then a file would be listed twice in reports, as detailed in [issue 1752](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1752). This is now fixed: absolute file names are always made relative when combining. Thanks to Bruno Rodrigues dos Santos for support.
-   Fix: the last case of a match/case statement had an incorrect message if the branch was missed. It said the pattern never matched, when actually the branch is missed if the last case always matched.
-   Fix: clicking a line number in the HTML report now positions more accurately.
-   Fix: the `report:format` setting was defined as a boolean, but should be a string. Thanks, [Tanaydin Sirin](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1754). It is also now documented on the `configuration page <config_report_format>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}.

Version 7.4.3 --- 2024-02-23 {#changes_7-4-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix: in some cases, coverage could fail with a RuntimeError: \"Set changed size during iteration.\" This is now fixed, closing [issue 1733](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1733).

Version 7.4.2 --- 2024-02-20 {#changes_7-4-2}
----------------------------

-   Fix: setting `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` no longer errors on 3.11 and lower, thanks [Hugo van Kemenade](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1747). It now issues a warning that sys.monitoring is not available and falls back to the default core instead.

Version 7.4.1 --- 2024-01-26 {#changes_7-4-1}
----------------------------

-   Python 3.13.0a3 is supported.
-   Fix: the JSON report now includes an explicit format version number, closing [issue 1732](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1732).

Version 7.4.0 --- 2023-12-27 {#changes_7-4-0}
----------------------------

-   In Python 3.12 and above, you can try an experimental core based on the new `sys.monitoring <python:sys.monitoring>`{.interpreted-text role="mod"} module by defining a `COVERAGE_CORE=sysmon` environment variable. This should be faster for line coverage, but not for branch coverage, and plugins and dynamic contexts are not yet supported with it. I am very interested to hear how it works (or doesn\'t!) for you.

Version 7.3.4 --- 2023-12-20 {#changes_7-3-4}
----------------------------

-   Fix: the change for multi-line signature exclusions in 7.3.3 broke other forms of nested clauses being excluded properly. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1713](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1713).
-   Fix: in the HTML report, selecting code for copying won\'t select the line numbers also. Thanks, [Robert Harris](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1717).

Version 7.3.3 --- 2023-12-14 {#changes_7-3-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix: function definitions with multi-line signatures can now be excluded by matching any of the lines, closing [issue 684](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/684). Thanks, [Jan Rusak, Maciej Kowalczyk and Joanna Ejzel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1705).
-   Fix: XML reports could fail with a TypeError if files had numeric components that were duplicates except for leading zeroes, like `file1.py` and `file001.py`. Fixes [issue 1709](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1709).
-   The `coverage annotate` command used to announce that it would be removed in a future version. Enough people got in touch to say that they use it, so it will stay. Don\'t expect it to keep up with other new features though.
-   Added new `debug options <cmd_run_debug>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}:
    -   `pytest` writes the pytest test name into the debug output.
    -   `dataop2` writes the full data being added to CoverageData objects.

Version 7.3.2 --- 2023-10-02 {#changes_7-3-2}
----------------------------

-   The `coverage lcov` command ignored the `[report] exclude_lines` and `[report] exclude_also` settings ([issue 1684](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1684)). This is now fixed, thanks [Jacqueline Lee](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1685).
-   Sometimes SQLite will create journal files alongside the coverage.py database files. These are ephemeral, but could be mistakenly included when combining data files. Now they are always ignored, fixing [issue 1605](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1605). Thanks to Brad Smith for suggesting fixes and providing detailed debugging.
-   On Python 3.12+, we now disable SQLite writing journal files, which should be a little faster.
-   The new 3.12 soft keyword `type` is properly bolded in HTML reports.
-   Removed the \"fullcoverage\" feature used by CPython to measure the coverage of early-imported standard library modules. CPython [stopped using it](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/88054) in 2021, and it stopped working completely in Python 3.13.

Version 7.3.1 --- 2023-09-06 {#changes_7-3-1}
----------------------------

-   The semantics of stars in file patterns has been clarified in the docs. A leading or trailing star matches any number of path components, like a double star would. This is different than the behavior of a star in the middle of a pattern. This discrepancy was [identified by Sviatoslav Sydorenko](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407#issuecomment-1631085209), who [provided patient detailed diagnosis](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1650) and graciously agreed to a pragmatic resolution.
-   The API docs were missing from the last version. They are now [restored](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api_coverage.html).

Version 7.3.0 --- 2023-08-12 {#changes_7-3-0}
----------------------------

-   Added a `.Coverage.collect`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} context manager to start and stop coverage data collection.
-   Dropped support for Python 3.7.
-   Fix: in unusual circumstances, SQLite cannot be set to asynchronous mode. Coverage.py would fail with the error `Safety level may not be changed inside a transaction.` This is now avoided, closing [issue 1646](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1646). Thanks to Michael Bell for the detailed bug report.
-   Docs: examples of configuration files now include separate examples for the different syntaxes: .coveragerc, pyproject.toml, setup.cfg, and tox.ini.
-   Fix: added `nosemgrep` comments to our JavaScript code so that semgrep-based SAST security checks won\'t raise false alarms about security problems that aren\'t problems.
-   Added a CITATION.cff file, thanks to [Ken Schackart](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1641).

Version 7.2.7 --- 2023-05-29 {#changes_7-2-7}
----------------------------

-   Fix: reverted a [change from 6.4.3](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347) that helped Cython, but also increased the size of data files when using dynamic contexts, as described in the now-fixed [issue 1586](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1586). The problem is now avoided due to a recent change ([issue 1538](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538)). Thanks to [Anders Kaseorg](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1629) and David Szotten for persisting with problem reports and detailed diagnoses.
-   Wheels are now provided for CPython 3.12.

Version 7.2.6 --- 2023-05-23 {#changes_7-2-6}
----------------------------

-   Fix: the `lcov` command could raise an IndexError exception if a file is translated to Python but then executed under its own name. Jinja2 does this when rendering templates. Fixes [issue 1553](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1553).
-   Python 3.12 beta 1 now inlines comprehensions. Previously they were compiled as invisible functions and coverage.py would warn you if they weren\'t completely executed. This no longer happens under Python 3.12.
-   Fix: the `coverage debug sys` command includes some environment variables in its output. This could have included sensitive data. Those values are now hidden with asterisks, closing [issue 1628](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1628).

Version 7.2.5 --- 2023-04-30 {#changes_7-2-5}
----------------------------

-   Fix: `html_report()` could fail with an AttributeError on `isatty` if run in an unusual environment where sys.stdout had been replaced. This is now fixed.

Version 7.2.4 --- 2023-04-28 {#changes_7-2-4}
----------------------------

PyCon 2023 sprint fixes!

-   Fix: with `relative_files = true`, specifying a specific file to include or omit wouldn\'t work correctly ([issue 1604](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1604)). This is now fixed, with testing help by [Marc Gibbons](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1608).
-   Fix: the XML report would have an incorrect `<source>` element when using relative files and the source option ended with a slash ([issue 1541](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1541)). This is now fixed, thanks to [Kevin Brown-Silva](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1608).
-   When the HTML report location is printed to the terminal, it\'s now a terminal-compatible URL, so that you can click the location to open the HTML file in your browser. Finishes [issue 1523](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1523) thanks to [Ricardo Newbery](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1613).
-   Docs: a new `Migrating page <migrating>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} with details about how to migrate between major versions of coverage.py. It currently covers the wildcard changes in 7.x. Thanks, [Brian Grohe](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1610).

Version 7.2.3 --- 2023-04-06 {#changes_7-2-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix: the `config_run_sigterm`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting was meant to capture data if a process was terminated with a SIGTERM signal, but it didn\'t always. This was fixed thanks to [Lewis Gaul](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1600), closing [issue 1599](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1599).
-   Performance: HTML reports with context information are now much more compact. File sizes are typically as small as one-third the previous size, but can be dramatically smaller. This closes [issue 1584](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1584) thanks to [Oleh Krehel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1587).
-   Development dependencies no longer use hashed pins, closing [issue 1592](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1592).

Version 7.2.2 --- 2023-03-16 {#changes_7-2-2}
----------------------------

-   Fix: if a virtualenv was created inside a source directory, and a sourced package was installed inside the virtualenv, then all of the third-party packages inside the virtualenv would be measured. This was incorrect, but has now been fixed: only the specified packages will be measured, thanks to [Manuel Jacob](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1560).
-   Fix: the `coverage lcov` command could create a .lcov file with incorrect LF (lines found) and LH (lines hit) totals. This is now fixed, thanks to [Ian Moore](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1583).
-   Fix: the `coverage xml` command on Windows could create a .xml file with duplicate `<package>` elements. This is now fixed, thanks to [Benjamin Parzella](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1574), closing [issue 1573](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1573).

Version 7.2.1 --- 2023-02-26 {#changes_7-2-1}
----------------------------

-   Fix: the PyPI page had broken links to documentation pages, but no longer does, closing [issue 1566](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1566).
-   Fix: public members of the coverage module are now properly indicated so that mypy will find them, fixing [issue 1564](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1564).

Version 7.2.0 --- 2023-02-22 {#changes_7-2-0}
----------------------------

-   Added a new setting `[report] exclude_also` to let you add more exclusions without overwriting the defaults. Thanks, [Alpha Chen](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1557), closing [issue 1391](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1391).
-   Added a `.CoverageData.purge_files`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method to remove recorded data for a particular file. Contributed by [Stephan Deibel](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1547).
-   Fix: when reporting commands fail, they will no longer congratulate themselves with messages like \"Wrote XML report to file.xml\" before spewing a traceback about their failure.
-   Fix: arguments in the public API that name file paths now accept pathlib.Path objects. This includes the `data_file` and `config_file` arguments to the Coverage constructor and the `basename` argument to CoverageData. Closes [issue 1552](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1552).
-   Fix: In some embedded environments, an IndexError could occur on stop() when the originating thread exits before completion. This is now fixed, thanks to [Russell Keith-Magee](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1543), closing [issue 1542](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1542).
-   Added a `py.typed` file to announce our type-hintedness. Thanks, [KotlinIsland](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1550).

Version 7.1.0 --- 2023-01-24 {#changes_7-1-0}
----------------------------

-   Added: the debug output file can now be specified with `[run] debug_file` in the configuration file. Closes [issue 1319](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1319).
-   Performance: fixed a slowdown with dynamic contexts that\'s been around since 6.4.3. The fix closes [issue 1538](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1538). Thankfully this doesn\'t break the [Cython change](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347) that fixed [issue 972](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972). Thanks to Mathieu Kniewallner for the deep investigative work and comprehensive issue report.
-   Typing: all product and test code has type annotations.

Version 7.0.5 --- 2023-01-10 {#changes_7-0-5}
----------------------------

-   Fix: On Python 3.7, a file with type annotations but no `from __future__ import annotations` would be missing statements in the coverage report. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1524](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1524).

Version 7.0.4 --- 2023-01-07 {#changes_7-0-4}
----------------------------

-   Performance: an internal cache of file names was accidentally disabled, resulting in sometimes drastic reductions in performance. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1527](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1527). Thanks to Ivan Ciuvalschii for the reproducible test case.

Version 7.0.3 --- 2023-01-03 {#changes_7-0-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix: when using pytest-cov or pytest-xdist, or perhaps both, the combining step could fail with `assert row is not None` using 7.0.2. This was due to a race condition that has always been possible and is still possible. In 7.0.1 and before, the error was silently swallowed by the combining code. Now it will produce a message \"Couldn\'t combine data file\" and ignore the data file as it used to do before 7.0.2. Closes [issue 1522](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1522).

Version 7.0.2 --- 2023-01-02 {#changes_7-0-2}
----------------------------

-   Fix: when using the `[run] relative_files = True` setting, a relative `[paths]` pattern was still being made absolute. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1519](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1519).
-   Fix: if Python doesn\'t provide tomllib, then TOML configuration files can only be read if coverage.py is installed with the `[toml]` extra. Coverage.py will raise an error if TOML support is not installed when it sees your settings are in a .toml file. But it didn\'t understand that `[tools.coverage]` was a valid section header, so the error wasn\'t reported if you used that header, and settings were silently ignored. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1516](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1516).
-   Fix: adjusted how decorators are traced on PyPy 7.3.10, fixing [issue 1515](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1515).
-   Fix: the `coverage lcov` report did not properly implement the `--fail-under=MIN` option. This has been fixed.
-   Refactor: added many type annotations, including a number of refactorings. This should not affect outward behavior, but they were a bit invasive in some places, so keep your eyes peeled for oddities.
-   Refactor: removed the vestigial and long untested support for Jython and IronPython.

Version 7.0.1 --- 2022-12-23 {#changes_7-0-1}
----------------------------

-   When checking if a file mapping resolved to a file that exists, we weren\'t considering files in .whl files. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1511](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1511).
-   File pattern rules were too strict, forbidding plus signs and curly braces in directory and file names. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1513](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1513).
-   Unusual Unicode or control characters in source files could prevent reporting. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1512](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1512).
-   The PyPy wheel now installs on PyPy 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9, closing [issue 1510](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1510).

Version 7.0.0 --- 2022-12-18 {#changes_7-0-0}
----------------------------

Nothing new beyond 7.0.0b1.

Version 7.0.0b1 --- 2022-12-03 {#changes_7-0-0b1}
------------------------------

A number of changes have been made to file path handling, including pattern matching and path remapping with the `[paths]` setting (see `config_paths`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}). These changes might affect you, and require you to update your settings.

(This release includes the changes from [6.6.0b1](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-6-6-0b1), since 6.6.0 was never released.)

-   Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your configuration:
    -   Previously, `*` would incorrectly match directory separators, making precise matching difficult. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1407](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407).
    -   Now `**` matches any number of nested directories, including none.
-   Improvements to combining data files when using the `config_run_relative_files`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting, which might require updating your configuration:
    -   During `coverage combine`, relative file paths are implicitly combined without needing a `[paths]` configuration setting. This also fixed [issue 991](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991).
    -   A `[paths]` setting like `*/foo` will now match `foo/bar.py` so that relative file paths can be combined more easily.
    -   The `config_run_relative_files`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting is properly interpreted in more places, fixing [issue 1280](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280).
-   When remapping file paths with `[paths]`, a path will be remapped only if the resulting path exists. The documentation has long said the prefix had to exist, but it was never enforced. This fixes [issue 608](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/608), improves [issue 649](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/649), and closes [issue 757](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/757).
-   Reporting operations now implicitly use the `[paths]` setting to remap file paths within a single data file. Combining multiple files still requires the `coverage combine` step, but this simplifies some single-file situations. Closes [issue 1212](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1212) and [issue 713](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/713).
-   The `coverage report` command now has a `--format=` option. The original style is now `--format=text`, and is the default.
    -   Using `--format=markdown` will write the table in Markdown format, thanks to [Steve Oswald](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1479), closing [issue 1418](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1418).
    -   Using `--format=total` will write a single total number to the output. This can be useful for making badges or writing status updates.
-   Combining data files with `coverage combine` now hashes the data files to skip files that add no new information. This can reduce the time needed. Many details affect the speed-up, but for coverage.py\'s own test suite, combining is about 40% faster. Closes [issue 1483](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1483).
-   When searching for completely un-executed files, coverage.py uses the presence of `__init__.py` files to determine which directories have source that could have been imported. However, [implicit namespace packages](https://peps.python.org/pep-0420/) don\'t require `__init__.py`. A new setting `[report] include_namespace_packages` tells coverage.py to consider these directories during reporting. Thanks to [Felix Horvat](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1387) for the contribution. Closes [issue 1383](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1383) and [issue 1024](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1024).
-   Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files. It was overly broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in [issue 1481](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481) and [issue 1345](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345). This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment substitution.
-   An empty file has a coverage total of 100%, but used to fail with `--fail-under`. This has been fixed, closing [issue 1470](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1470).
-   The text report table no longer writes out two separator lines if there are no files listed in the table. One is plenty.
-   Fixed a mis-measurement of a strange use of wildcard alternatives in match/case statements, closing [issue 1421](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1421).
-   Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on implementations other than CPython or PyPy ([issue 1474](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474)).
-   The deprecated `[run] note` setting has been completely removed.

Version 6.6.0b1 --- 2022-10-31 {#changes_6-6-0b1}
------------------------------

(Note: 6.6.0 final was never released. These changes are part of [7.0.0b1](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changes.html#changes-7-0-0b1).)

-   Changes to file pattern matching, which might require updating your configuration:
    -   Previously, `*` would incorrectly match directory separators, making precise matching difficult. This is now fixed, closing [issue 1407](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1407).
    -   Now `**` matches any number of nested directories, including none.
-   Improvements to combining data files when using the `config_run_relative_files`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} setting:
    -   During `coverage combine`, relative file paths are implicitly combined without needing a `[paths]` configuration setting. This also fixed [issue 991](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/991).
    -   A `[paths]` setting like `*/foo` will now match `foo/bar.py` so that relative file paths can be combined more easily.
    -   The setting is properly interpreted in more places, fixing [issue 1280](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1280).
-   Fixed environment variable expansion in pyproject.toml files. It was overly broad, causing errors outside of coverage.py settings, as described in [issue 1481](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1481) and [issue 1345](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1345). This is now fixed, but in rare cases will require changing your pyproject.toml to quote non-string values that use environment substitution.
-   Fixed internal logic that prevented coverage.py from running on implementations other than CPython or PyPy ([issue 1474](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1474)).

Version 6.5.0 --- 2022-09-29 {#changes_6-5-0}
----------------------------

-   The JSON report now includes details of which branches were taken, and which are missing for each file. Thanks, [Christoph Blessing](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1438). Closes [issue 1425](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1425).
-   Starting with coverage.py 6.2, `class` statements were marked as a branch. This wasn\'t right, and has been reverted, fixing [issue 1449](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1449). Note this will very slightly reduce your coverage total if you are measuring branch coverage.
-   Packaging is now compliant with [PEP 517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/), closing [issue 1395](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1395).
-   A new debug option `--debug=pathmap` shows details of the remapping of paths that happens during combine due to the `[paths]` setting.
-   Fix an internal problem with caching of invalid Python parsing. Found by OSS-Fuzz, fixing their [bug 50381](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/oss-fuzz/issues/detail?id=50381).

Version 6.4.4 --- 2022-08-16 {#changes_6-4-4}
----------------------------

-   Wheels are now provided for Python 3.11.

Version 6.4.3 --- 2022-08-06 {#changes_6-4-3}
----------------------------

-   Fix a failure when combining data files if the file names contained glob-like patterns. Thanks, [Michael Krebs and Benjamin Schubert](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1405).
-   Fix a messaging failure when combining Windows data files on a different drive than the current directory, closing [issue 1428](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1428). Thanks, [Lorenzo Micò](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1430).
-   Fix path calculations when running in the root directory, as you might do in a Docker container. Thanks [Arthur Rio](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1403).
-   Filtering in the HTML report wouldn\'t work when reloading the index page. This is now fixed. Thanks, [Marc Legendre](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1413).
-   Fix a problem with Cython code measurement, closing [issue 972](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/972). Thanks, [Matus Valo](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1347).

Version 6.4.2 --- 2022-07-12 {#changes_6-4-2}
----------------------------

-   Updated for a small change in Python 3.11.0 beta 4: modules now start with a line with line number 0, which is ignored. This line cannot be executed, so coverage totals were thrown off. This line is now ignored by coverage.py, but this also means that truly empty modules (like `__init__.py`) have no lines in them, rather than one phantom line. Fixes [issue 1419](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1419).
-   Internal debugging data added to sys.modules is now an actual module, to avoid confusing code that examines everything in sys.modules. Thanks, [Yilei Yang](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1399).

Version 6.4.1 --- 2022-06-02 {#changes_6-4-1}
----------------------------

-   Greatly improved performance on PyPy, and other environments that need the pure Python trace function. Thanks, Carl Friedrich Bolz-Tereick ([pull 1381](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1381) and [pull 1388](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1388)). Slightly improved performance when using the C trace function, as most environments do. Closes [issue 1339](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1339).
-   The conditions for using tomllib from the standard library have been made more precise, so that 3.11 alphas will continue to work. Closes [issue 1390](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1390).

Version 6.4 --- 2022-05-22 {#changes_64}
--------------------------

-   A new setting, `config_run_sigterm`{.interpreted-text role="ref"}, controls whether a SIGTERM signal handler is used. In 6.3, the signal handler was always installed, to capture data at unusual process ends. Unfortunately, this introduced other problems (see [issue 1310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310)). Now the signal handler is only used if you opt-in by setting `[run] sigterm = true`.
-   Small changes to the HTML report:
    -   Added links to next and previous file, and more keyboard shortcuts: `[` and `]` for next file and previous file; `u` for up to the index; and `?` to open/close the help panel. Thanks, [J. M. F. Tsang](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1364).
    -   The time stamp and version are displayed at the top of the report. Thanks, [Ammar Askar](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1354). Closes [issue 1351](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1351).
-   A new debug option `debug=sqldata` adds more detail to `debug=sql`, logging all the data being written to the database.
-   Previously, running `coverage report` (or any of the reporting commands) in an empty directory would create a .coverage data file. Now they do not, fixing [issue 1328](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1328).
-   On Python 3.11, the `[toml]` extra no longer installs tomli, instead using tomllib from the standard library. Thanks [Shantanu](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1359).
-   In-memory CoverageData objects now properly update(), closing [issue 1323](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1323).

Version 6.3.3 --- 2022-05-12 {#changes_633}
----------------------------

-   Fix: Coverage.py now builds successfully on CPython 3.11 (3.11.0b1) again. Closes [issue 1367](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1367). Some results for generators may have changed.

Version 6.3.2 --- 2022-02-20 {#changes_632}
----------------------------

-   Fix: adapt to pypy3.9\'s decorator tracing behavior. It now traces function decorators like CPython 3.8: both the @-line and the def-line are traced. Fixes [issue 1326](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1326).
-   Debug: added `pybehave` to the list of `coverage debug <cmd_debug>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} and `cmd_run_debug`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} options.
-   Fix: show an intelligible error message if `--concurrency=multiprocessing` is used without a configuration file. Closes [issue 1320](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1320).

Version 6.3.1 --- 2022-02-01 {#changes_631}
----------------------------

-   Fix: deadlocks could occur when terminating processes. Some of these deadlocks (described in [issue 1310](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1310)) are now fixed.
-   Fix: a signal handler was being set from multiple threads, causing an error: \"ValueError: signal only works in main thread\". This is now fixed, closing [issue 1312](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1312).
-   Fix: `--precision` on the command-line was being ignored while considering `--fail-under`. This is now fixed, thanks to [Marcelo Trylesinski](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1317).
-   Fix: releases no longer provide 3.11.0-alpha wheels. Coverage.py uses CPython internal fields which are moving during the alpha phase. Fixes [issue 1316](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1316).

Version 6.3 --- 2022-01-25 {#changes_63}
--------------------------

-   Feature: Added the `lcov` command to generate reports in LCOV format. Thanks, [Bradley Burns](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1289). Closes issues [587](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/587) and [626](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/626).
-   Feature: the coverage data file can now be specified on the command line with the `--data-file` option in any command that reads or writes data. This is in addition to the existing `COVERAGE_FILE` environment variable. Closes [issue 624](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/624). Thanks, [Nikita Bloshchanevich](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1304).
-   Feature: coverage measurement data will now be written when a SIGTERM signal is received by the process. This includes `Process.terminate <python:multiprocessing.Process.terminate>`{.interpreted-text role="meth"}, and other ways to terminate a process. Currently this is only on Linux and Mac; Windows is not supported. Fixes [issue 1307](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1307).
-   Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached end-of-life on 2021-12-23.
-   Updated Python 3.11 support to 3.11.0a4, fixing [issue 1294](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1294).
-   Fix: the coverage data file is now created in a more robust way, to avoid problems when multiple processes are trying to write data at once. Fixes issues [1303](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1303) and [883](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/883).
-   Fix: a .gitignore file will only be written into the HTML report output directory if the directory is empty. This should prevent certain unfortunate accidents of writing the file where it is not wanted.
-   Releases now have MacOS arm64 wheels for Apple Silicon, fixing [issue 1288](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1288).

Version 6.2 --- 2021-11-26 {#changes_62}
--------------------------

-   Feature: Now the `--concurrency` setting can have a list of values, so that threads and another lightweight threading package can be measured together, such as `--concurrency=gevent,thread`. Closes [issue 1012](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1012) and [issue 1082](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1082). This also means that `thread` must be explicitly specified in some cases that used to be implicit such as `--concurrency=multiprocessing`, which must be changed to `--concurrency=multiprocessing,thread`.
-   Fix: A module specified as the `source` setting is imported during startup, before the user program imports it. This could cause problems if the rest of the program isn\'t ready yet. For example, [issue 1203](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1203) describes a Django setting that is accessed before settings have been configured. Now the early import is wrapped in a try/except so errors then don\'t stop execution.
-   Fix: A colon in a decorator expression would cause an exclusion to end too early, preventing the exclusion of the decorated function. This is now fixed.
-   Fix: The HTML report now will not overwrite a .gitignore file that already exists in the HTML output directory (follow-on for [issue 1244](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244)).
-   API: The exceptions raised by Coverage.py have been specialized, to provide finer-grained catching of exceptions by third-party code.
-   API: Using `suffix=False` when constructing a Coverage object with multiprocessing wouldn\'t suppress the data file suffix ([issue 989](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/989)). This is now fixed.
-   Debug: The `coverage debug data` command will now sniff out combinable data files, and report on all of them.
-   Debug: The `coverage debug` command used to accept a number of topics at a time, and show all of them, though this was never documented. This no longer works, to allow for command-line options in the future.

Version 6.1.2 --- 2021-11-10 {#changes_612}
----------------------------

-   Python 3.11 is supported (tested with 3.11.0a2). One still-open issue has to do with [exits through with-statements](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1270).
-   Fix: When remapping file paths through the `[paths]` setting while combining, the `[run] relative_files` setting was ignored, resulting in absolute paths for remapped file names ([issue 1147](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1147)). This is now fixed.
-   Fix: Complex conditionals over excluded lines could have incorrectly reported a missing branch ([issue 1271](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1271)). This is now fixed.
-   Fix: More exceptions are now handled when trying to parse source files for reporting. Problems that used to terminate coverage.py can now be handled with `[report] ignore_errors`. This helps with plugins failing to read files ([django\_coverage\_plugin issue 78](https://github.com/nedbat/django_coverage_plugin/issues/78)).
-   Fix: Removed another vestige of jQuery from the source tarball ([issue 840](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840)).
-   Fix: Added a default value for a new-to-6.x argument of an internal class. This unsupported class is being used by coveralls ([issue 1273](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1273)). Although I\'d rather not \"fix\" unsupported interfaces, it\'s actually nicer with a default value.

Version 6.1.1 --- 2021-10-31 {#changes_611}
----------------------------

-   Fix: The sticky header on the HTML report didn\'t work unless you had branch coverage enabled. This is now fixed: the sticky header works for everyone. (Do people still use coverage without branch measurement!? j/k)
-   Fix: When using explicitly declared namespace packages, the \"already imported a file that will be measured\" warning would be issued ([issue 888](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/888)). This is now fixed.

Version 6.1 --- 2021-10-30 {#changes_61}
--------------------------

-   Deprecated: The `annotate` command and the `Coverage.annotate` function will be removed in a future version, unless people let me know that they are using it. Instead, the `html` command gives better-looking (and more accurate) output, and the `report -m` command will tell you line numbers of missing lines. Please get in touch if you have a reason to use `annotate` over those better options: <ned@nedbatchelder.com>.
-   Feature: Coverage now sets an environment variable, `COVERAGE_RUN` when running your code with the `coverage run` command. The value is not important, and may change in the future. Closes [issue 553](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/553).
-   Feature: The HTML report pages for Python source files now have a sticky header so the file name and controls are always visible.
-   Feature: The `xml` and `json` commands now describe what they wrote where.
-   Feature: The `html`, `combine`, `xml`, and `json` commands all accept a `-q/--quiet` option to suppress the messages they write to stdout about what they are doing ([issue 1254](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1254)).
-   Feature: The `html` command writes a `.gitignore` file into the HTML output directory, to prevent the report from being committed to git. If you want to commit it, you will need to delete that file. Closes [issue 1244](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1244).
-   Feature: Added support for PyPy 3.8.
-   Fix: More generated code is now excluded from measurement. Code such as [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/) boilerplate, or doctest code, was being measured though the synthetic line numbers meant they were never reported. Once Cython was involved though, the generated .so files were parsed as Python, raising syntax errors, as reported in [issue 1160](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1160). This is now fixed.
-   Fix: When sorting human-readable names, numeric components are sorted correctly: file10.py will appear after file9.py. This applies to file names, module names, environment variables, and test contexts.
-   Performance: Branch coverage measurement is faster, though you might only notice on code that is executed many times, such as long-running loops.
-   Build: jQuery is no longer used or vendored ([issue 840](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/840) and [issue 1118](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1118)). Huge thanks to Nils Kattenbeck (septatrix) for the conversion to vanilla JavaScript in [pull request 1248](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1248).

Version 6.0.2 --- 2021-10-11 {#changes_602}
----------------------------

-   Namespace packages being measured weren\'t properly handled by the new code that ignores third-party packages. If the namespace package was installed, it was ignored as a third-party package. That problem ([issue 1231](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1231)) is now fixed.
-   Packages named as \"source packages\" (with `source`, or `source_pkgs`, or pytest-cov\'s `--cov`) might have been only partially measured. Their top-level statements could be marked as un-executed, because they were imported by coverage.py before measurement began ([issue 1232](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1232)). This is now fixed, but the package will be imported twice, once by coverage.py, then again by your test suite. This could cause problems if importing the package has side effects.
-   The `.CoverageData.contexts_by_lineno`{.interpreted-text role="meth"} method was documented to return a dict, but was returning a defaultdict. Now it returns a plain dict. It also no longer returns negative numbered keys.

Version 6.0.1 --- 2021-10-06 {#changes_601}
----------------------------

-   In 6.0, the coverage.py exceptions moved from coverage.misc to coverage.exceptions. These exceptions are not part of the public supported API, CoverageException is. But a number of other third-party packages were importing the exceptions from coverage.misc, so they are now available from there again ([issue 1226](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1226)).
-   Changed an internal detail of how tomli is imported, so that tomli can use coverage.py for their own test suite ([issue 1228](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1228)).
-   Defend against an obscure possibility under code obfuscation, where a function can have an argument called \"self\", but no local named \"self\" ([pull request 1210](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1210)). Thanks, Ben Carlsson.

Version 6.0 --- 2021-10-03 {#changes_60}
--------------------------

-   The `coverage html` command now prints a message indicating where the HTML report was written. Fixes [issue 1195](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1195).
-   The `coverage combine` command now prints messages indicating each data file being combined. Fixes [issue 1105](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1105).
-   The HTML report now includes a sentence about skipped files due to `skip_covered` or `skip_empty` settings. Fixes [issue 1163](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1163).
-   Unrecognized options in the configuration file are no longer errors. They are now warnings, to ease the use of coverage across versions. Fixes [issue 1035](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1035).
-   Fix handling of exceptions through context managers in Python 3.10. A missing exception is no longer considered a missing branch from the with statement. Fixes [issue 1205](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1205).
-   Fix another rarer instance of \"Error binding parameter 0 - probably unsupported type.\" ([issue 1010](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010)).
-   Creating a directory for the coverage data file now is safer against conflicts when two coverage runs happen simultaneously ([pull 1220](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1220)). Thanks, Clément Pit-Claudel.

Version 6.0b1 --- 2021-07-18 {#changes_60b1}
----------------------------

-   Dropped support for Python 2.7, PyPy 2, and Python 3.5.
-   Added support for the Python 3.10 `match/case` syntax.
-   Data collection is now thread-safe. There may have been rare instances of exceptions raised in multi-threaded programs.
-   Plugins (like the [Django coverage plugin](https://pypi.org/project/django-coverage-plugin/)) were generating \"Already imported a file that will be measured\" warnings about Django itself. These have been fixed, closing [issue 1150](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1150).
-   Warnings generated by coverage.py are now real Python warnings.
-   Using `--fail-under=100` with coverage near 100% could result in the self-contradictory message `total of 100 is less than fail-under=100`. This bug ([issue 1168](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1168)) is now fixed.
-   The `COVERAGE_DEBUG_FILE` environment variable now accepts `stdout` and `stderr` to write to those destinations.
-   TOML parsing now uses the [tomli](https://pypi.org/project/tomli/) library.
-   Some minor changes to usually invisible details of the HTML report:
    -   Use a modern hash algorithm when fingerprinting, for high-security environments ([issue 1189](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1189)). When generating the HTML report, we save the hash of the data, to avoid regenerating an unchanged HTML page. We used to use MD5 to generate the hash, and now use SHA-3-256. This was never a security concern, but security scanners would notice the MD5 algorithm and raise a false alarm.
    -   Change how report file names are generated, to avoid leading underscores ([issue 1167](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1167)), to avoid rare file name collisions ([issue 584](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/584)), and to avoid file names becoming too long ([issue 580](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/580)).

Version 5.6b1 --- 2021-04-13 {#changes_56b1}
----------------------------

Note: 5.6 final was never released. These changes are part of 6.0.

-   Third-party packages are now ignored in coverage reporting. This solves a few problems:
    -   Coverage will no longer report about other people\'s code ([issue 876](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/876)). This is true even when using `--source=.` with a venv in the current directory.
    -   Coverage will no longer generate \"Already imported a file that will be measured\" warnings about coverage itself ([issue 905](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/905)).
-   The HTML report uses j/k to move up and down among the highlighted chunks of code. They used to highlight the current chunk, but 5.0 broke that behavior. Now the highlighting is working again.
-   The JSON report now includes `percent_covered_display`, a string with the total percentage, rounded to the same number of decimal places as the other reports\' totals.

Version 5.5 --- 2021-02-28 {#changes_55}
--------------------------

-   `coverage combine` has a new option, `--keep` to keep the original data files after combining them. The default is still to delete the files after they have been combined. This was requested in [issue 1108](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1108) and implemented in [pull request 1110](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1110). Thanks, Éric Larivière.
-   When reporting missing branches in `coverage report`, branches aren\'t reported that jump to missing lines. This adds to the long-standing behavior of not reporting branches from missing lines. Now branches are only reported if both the source and destination lines are executed. Closes both [issue 1065](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1065) and [issue 955](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/955).
-   Minor improvements to the HTML report:
    -   The state of the line visibility selector buttons is saved in local storage so you don\'t have to fiddle with them so often, fixing [issue 1123](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1123).
    -   It has a little more room for line numbers so that 4-digit numbers work well, fixing [issue 1124](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1124).
-   Improved the error message when combining line and branch data, so that users will be more likely to understand what\'s happening, closing [issue 803](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/803).

Version 5.4 --- 2021-01-24 {#changes_54}
--------------------------

-   The text report produced by `coverage report` now always outputs a TOTAL line, even if only one Python file is reported. This makes regex parsing of the output easier. Thanks, Judson Neer. This had been requested a number of times ([issue 1086](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1086), [issue 922](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/922), [issue 732](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/732)).
-   The `skip_covered` and `skip_empty` settings in the configuration file can now be specified in the `[html]` section, so that text reports and HTML reports can use separate settings. The HTML report will still use the `[report]` settings if there isn\'t a value in the `[html]` section. Closes [issue 1090](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1090).
-   Combining files on Windows across drives now works properly, fixing [issue 577](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/577). Thanks, [Valentin Lab](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1080).
-   Fix an obscure warning from deep in the \_decimal module, as reported in [issue 1084](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1084).
-   Update to support Python 3.10 alphas in progress, including [PEP 626: Precise line numbers for debugging and other tools](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0626/).

Version 5.3.1 --- 2020-12-19 {#changes_531}
----------------------------

-   When using `--source` on a large source tree, v5.x was slower than previous versions. This performance regression is now fixed, closing [issue 1037](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1037).
-   Mysterious SQLite errors can happen on PyPy, as reported in [issue 1010](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1010). An immediate retry seems to fix the problem, although it is an unsatisfying solution.
-   The HTML report now saves the sort order in a more widely supported way, fixing [issue 986](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/986). Thanks, Sebastián Ramírez ([pull request 1066](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/pull/1066)).
-   The HTML report pages now have a `Sleepy Snake <sleepy>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} favicon.
-   Wheels are now provided for manylinux2010, and for PyPy3 (pp36 and pp37).
-   Continuous integration has moved from Travis and AppVeyor to GitHub Actions.

Version 5.3 --- 2020-09-13 {#changes_53}
--------------------------

-   The `source` setting has always been interpreted as either a file path or a module, depending on which existed. If both interpretations were valid, it was assumed to be a file path. The new `source_pkgs` setting can be used to name a package to disambiguate this case. Thanks, Thomas Grainger. Fixes [issue 268](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/268).
-   If a plugin was disabled due to an exception, we used to still try to record its information, causing an exception, as reported in [issue 1011](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/1011). This is now fixed.

      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Coverage.py measures code coverage, typically during test execution. It uses the code analysis tools and tracing hooks provided in the Python standard library to determine which lines are executable, and which have been executed.

Coverage.py runs on these versions of Python:

-   Python 3.9 through 3.14 alpha 1, including free-threading.
-   PyPy3 versions 3.9 and 3.10.

Documentation is on [Read the Docs](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/). Code repository and issue tracker are on [GitHub](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy).

**New in 7.x:** multi-line exclusion patterns; function/class reporting; experimental support for sys.monitoring; dropped support for Python 3.7 and 3.8; added `Coverage.collect()` context manager; improved data combining; `[run] exclude_also` setting; `report --format=`; type annotations.

**New in 6.x:** dropped support for Python 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6; write data on SIGTERM; added support for 3.10 match/case statements.

* Release checklist

- Check that the current virtualenv matches the current coverage branch.
- start branch for release work
    $ make relbranch
- check version number in coverage/version.py
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        - edit to look like one of these:
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "alpha", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "beta", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "candidate", 1)
        version_info = (4, 0, 2, "final", 0)
    - IF NOT PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make release_version
- Update source files with release facts, and get useful snippets:
    $ make edit_for_release cheats
- Edit supported Python version numbers. Search for "PYVERSIONS".
    - Especially README.rst and doc/index.rst
- Look over CHANGES.rst
- Update README.rst
    - "New in x.y:"
- Update docs
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        - Version of latest stable release in doc/index.rst
    - Make sure the docs are cogged:
        $ make prebuild
    - Don't forget the man page: doc/python-coverage.1.txt
    - Check that the docs build correctly:
        $ tox -e doc
- commit the release-prep changes
    $ make relcommit1
- Generate new sample_html to get the latest, incl footer version number:
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make sample_html_beta
    - IF NOT PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make sample_html
        - check in the new sample html
            $ make relcommit2
- Build and publish docs:
    - IF PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make publishbeta
    - ELSE:
        $ make publish
    - commit and publish nedbatchelder.com
- Done with changes to source files
    $ g puo; gshipit
        - check them in on the release prep branch
        - wait for ci to finish
        - merge to master
        - git push
- Start the kits:
    $ opvars github
    - Trigger the kit GitHub Action
        $ make build_kits
- Kits:
    - Wait for kits to finish:
        - https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/actions/workflows/kit.yml
    - test the pypi upload:
        $ make test_upload
        - approve the action
            - https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/actions/workflows/publish.yml
    - upload kits:
        $ make pypi_upload
        - approve the action
            - https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/actions/workflows/publish.yml
- Tag the tree, update GitHub releases and comment on issues:
    $ make clean tag github_releases comment_on_fixes
$ deopvars
- Bump version:
    $ make bump_version
- Update readthedocs
    - IF PRE-RELEASE
        - find the latest tag in the inactive list, edit it, make it active.
        - keep just the latest version of each x.y release, make the rest active but hidden.
            - pre-releases should be hidden
    - IF NOT PRE-RELEASE:
        $ make update_rtd
- Once CI passes, merge the bump-version branch to master and push it
    $ gshipit


* Testing

- Testing of Python code is handled by tox.
    - Create and activate a virtualenv
    - pip install -r requirements/dev.pip
    - $ tox

- For complete coverage testing:

    $ make metacov

    This will run coverage.py under its own measurement.  You can do this in
    different environments (Linux vs. Windows, for example), then copy the data
    files (.metacov.*) to one machine for combination and reporting.  To
    combine and report:

    $ make metahtml

- To run the Javascript tests:

    open tests/js/index.html in variety of browsers.
