# April 2015 is "adopt pytest month"

Are you an enthusiastic pytest user, the local testing guru in your workplace? Or are you considering using pytest for your open source project, but not sure how to get started? Then you may be interested in "adopt pytest month"\!

We will pair experienced pytest users with open source projects, for a month's effort of getting new development teams started with pytest.

In 2015 we are trying this for the first time. In February and March 2015 we will gather volunteers on both sides, in April we will do the work, and in May we will evaluate how it went. This effort is being coordinated by Brianna Laugher. If you have any questions or comments, you can raise them on the [@pytestdotorg twitter account](https://twitter.com/pytestdotorg), the `issue tracker <676>` or the [pytest-dev mailing list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pytest-dev).

## The ideal pytest helper

>   - will be able to commit 2-4 hours a week to working with their particular project (this might involve joining their mailing list, installing the software and exploring any existing tests, offering advice, writing some example tests)
>   - feels confident in using pytest (e.g. has explored command line options, knows how to write parametrized tests, has an idea about conftest contents)
>   - does not need to be an expert in every aspect\!

Pytest helpers, sign up here\! (preferably in February, hard deadline 22 March)

## The ideal partner project

>   - is open source, and predominantly written in Python
>   - has an automated/documented install process for developers
>   - has more than one core developer
>   - has at least one official release (e.g. is available on pypi)
>   - has the support of the core development team, in trying out pytest adoption
>   - has no tests... or 100% test coverage... or somewhere in between\!

Partner projects, sign up here\! (by 22 March)

## What does it mean to "adopt pytest"?

There can be many different definitions of "success". Pytest can run many [unittest](unittest.html) tests by default, so using pytest as your testrunner may be possible from day 1. Job done, right?

Progressive success might look like:

>   - tests can be run (by pytest) without errors (there may be failures)
> 
>   - tests can be run (by pytest) without failures
> 
>   - test runner is integrated into CI server
> 
>   -   - existing tests are rewritten to take advantage of pytest features - this can happen in several iterations, for example:
>         
>           - changing to native [assert](assert.html) statements ([pycmd](https://bitbucket.org/hpk42/pycmd/overview) has a script to help with that, `pyconvert_unittest.py`)
>           - changing [setUp/tearDown methods](xunit_setup.html) to [fixtures](fixture.html)
>           - adding [markers](mark.html)
>           - other changes to reduce boilerplate
> 
>   - assess needs for future tests to be written, e.g. new fixtures, [distributed](xdist.html) testing tweaks

"Success" should also include that the development team feels comfortable with their knowledge of how to use pytest. In fact this is probably more important than anything else. So spending a lot of time on communication, giving examples, etc will probably be important - both in running the tests, and in writing them.

It may be after the month is up, the partner project decides that pytest is not right for it. That's okay - hopefully the pytest team will also learn something about its weaknesses or deficiencies.

# py.test 2.0.0: asserts++, unittest++, reporting++, config++, docs++

Welcome to pytest-2.0.0, a major new release of "py.test", the rapid easy Python testing tool. There are many new features and enhancements, see below for summary and detailed lists. A lot of long-deprecated code has been removed, resulting in a much smaller and cleaner implementation. See the new docs with examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/en/stable/index.html>

A note on packaging: pytest used to part of the "py" distribution up until version py-1.3.4 but this has changed now: pytest-2.0.0 only contains py.test related code and is expected to be backward-compatible to existing test code. If you want to install pytest, just type one of:

    pip install -U pytest
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or complaining. Particular thanks to Floris Bruynooghe and Ronny Pfannschmidt for their great coding contributions and many others for feedback and help.

best, holger krekel

## New Features

  - new invocations through Python interpreter and from Python:
    
        python -m pytest      # on all pythons >= 2.5
    
    or from a python program:
    
        import pytest ; pytest.main(arglist, pluginlist)
    
    see <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/usage.html> for details.

  - new and better reporting information in assert expressions if comparing lists, sequences or strings.
    
    see <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html#newreport>

  - new configuration through ini-files (setup.cfg or tox.ini recognized), for example:
    
        [pytest]
        norecursedirs = .hg data*  # don't ever recurse in such dirs
        addopts = -x --pyargs      # add these command line options by default
    
    see <http://pytest.org/en/stable/reference/customize.html>

  - improved standard unittest support. In general py.test should now better be able to run custom unittest.TestCases like twisted trial or Django based TestCases. Also you can now run the tests of an installed 'unittest' package with py.test:
    
        py.test --pyargs unittest

  - new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more nose/unittest-style "dot" output.

  - many, many, more detailed improvements details

## Fixes

  - fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set\_trace() to trace execution via PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
  - fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
  - fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded. (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
  - fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
  - fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
  - fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark" applied at class/module level

## Important Notes

  - The usual way in pre-2.0 times to use py.test in python code was to import "py" and then e.g. use "py.test.raises" for the helper. This remains valid and is not planned to be deprecated. However, in most examples and internal code you'll find "import pytest" and "pytest.raises" used as the recommended default way.
  - pytest now first performs collection of the complete test suite before running any test. This changes for example the semantics of when pytest\_collectstart/pytest\_collectreport are called. Some plugins may need upgrading.
  - The pytest package consists of a 400 LOC core.py and about 20 builtin plugins, summing up to roughly 5000 LOCs, including docstrings. To be fair, it also uses generic code from the "pylib", and the new "py" package to help with filesystem and introspection/code manipulation.

## (Incompatible) Removals

  - py.test.config is now only available if you are in a test run.

  - the following (mostly already deprecated) functionality was removed:
    
      - removed support for Module/Class/... collection node definitions in conftest.py files. They will cause nothing special.
      - removed support for calling the pre-1.0 collection API of "run()" and "join"
      - removed reading option values from conftest.py files or env variables. This can now be done much, much, better and easier through the ini-file mechanism and the "addopts" entry in particular.
      - removed the "disabled" attribute in test classes. Use the skipping and pytestmark mechanism to skip or xfail a test class.

  - py.test.collect.Directory does not exist anymore and it is not possible to provide an own "Directory" object. If you have used this and don't know what to do, get in contact. We'll figure something out.
    
    Note that pytest\_collect\_directory() is still called but any return value will be ignored. This allows to keep old code working that performed for example "py.test.skip()" in collect() to prevent recursion into directory trees if a certain dependency or command line option is missing.

see \[changelog\](\#changelog) for more detailed changes.

# py.test 2.0.1: bug fixes

Welcome to pytest-2.0.1, a maintenance and bug fix release of pytest, a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython and latest PyPy interpreters. See extensive docs with tested examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/>

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or complaining. Particular thanks to Floris Bruynooghe and Ronny Pfannschmidt for their great coding contributions and many others for feedback and help.

best, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.0.0 and 2.0.1

  - refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py file or plugin.
  - fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information to reporting test header
  - fix issue17 (import-\* reporting issue on python3) by requiring py\>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
  - fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining assertion interpretation in py lib
  - fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
  - remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
  - improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
  - improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO" (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential false positives)
  - introduce a pytest\_cmdline\_processargs(args) hook to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments. This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0 allowed to set command line options from conftest.py files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
  - fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules. unexpected failures in doctests will not generally show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
  - fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally passing (not xpassing) if they succeed. This only is true for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown\_class/ teardown\_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
  - fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
  - refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
  - refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
  - introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the command line, see <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/plugins.html#cmdunregister>
  - activate resultlog plugin by default
  - fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the collection-before-running semantics were not setup as with pytest 1.3.4. Note, however, that the recommended and much cleaner way to do test parametrization remains the "pytest\_generate\_tests" mechanism, see the docs.

# py.test 2.0.2: bug fixes, improved xfail/skip expressions, speed ups

Welcome to pytest-2.0.2, a maintenance and bug fix release of pytest, a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython and latest PyPy interpreters. See the extensive docs with tested examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/>

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Many thanks to all issue reporters and people asking questions or complaining, particularly Jurko for his insistence, Laura, Victor and Brianna for helping with improving and Ronny for his general advise.

best, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.0.1 and 2.0.2

  - tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions by reducing the relative overhead

  - fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting. If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail expressions you now get nice error reports.
    
    Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif expressions so that this for example works now:
    
        import pytest
        import mymodule
        @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
        def test_function():
            pass
    
    This will not run the test function if the module's version string does not start with a "1". Note that specifying a string instead of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping (or xfail-ing) tests.

  - fix issue28 - setup\_method and pytest\_generate\_tests work together The setup\_method fixture method now gets called also for test function invocations generated from the pytest\_generate\_tests hook.

  - fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline in order to execute a particular test.

  - fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

  - fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges this.

  - fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular thanks to Laura Creighton who also reviewed parts of the documentation.

  - fix slightly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes (thanks Amaury)

  - more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

  - avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

# py.test 2.0.3: bug fixes and speed ups

Welcome to pytest-2.0.3, a maintenance and bug fix release of pytest, a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython and latest PyPy interpreters. See the extensive docs with tested examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/>

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

There also is a bugfix release 1.6 of pytest-xdist, the plugin that enables seamless distributed and "looponfail" testing for Python.

best, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.0.2 and 2.0.3

  - fix issue38: nicer tracebacks on calls to hooks, particularly early configure/sessionstart ones
  - fix missing skip reason/meta information in junitxml files, reported via <http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2011-March/003928.html>
  - fix issue34: avoid collection failure with "test" prefixed classes deriving from object.
  - don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without --genscript actually being used.
  - speed up skips (by not doing a full traceback representation internally)
  - fix issue37: avoid invalid characters in junitxml's output

# py.test 2.1.0: perfected assertions and bug fixes

Welcome to the release of pytest-2.1, a mature testing tool for Python, supporting CPython 2.4-3.2, Jython and latest PyPy interpreters. See the improved extensive docs (now also as PDF\!) with tested examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/>

The single biggest news about this release are **perfected assertions** courtesy of Benjamin Peterson. You can now safely use `assert` statements in test modules without having to worry about side effects or python optimization ("-OO") options. This is achieved by rewriting assert statements in test modules upon import, using a PEP302 hook. See <https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html> for detailed information. The work has been partly sponsored by my company, merlinux GmbH.

For further details on bug fixes and smaller enhancements see below.

If you want to install or upgrade pytest, just type one of:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

best, holger krekel / <https://merlinux.eu/>

## Changes between 2.0.3 and 2.1.0

  - fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
  - fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
  - merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported. see doc/assert.txt for more info.
  - fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on unexpected exceptions
  - fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
  - fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception
  - fix issue49: avoid confusing error when initialization partially fails
  - fix issue44: env/username expansion for junitxml file path
  - show releaselevel information in test runs for pypy
  - reworked doc pages for better navigation and PDF generation
  - report KeyboardInterrupt even if interrupted during session startup
  - fix issue 35 - provide PDF doc version and download link from index page

# py.test 2.2.0: test marking++, parametrization++ and duration profiling

pytest-2.2.0 is a test-suite compatible release of the popular py.test testing tool. Plugins might need upgrades. It comes with these improvements:

  - easier and more powerful parametrization of tests:
      - new @pytest.mark.parametrize decorator to run tests with different arguments
      - new metafunc.parametrize() API for parametrizing arguments independently
      - see examples at <http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html>
      - NOTE that parametrize() related APIs are still a bit experimental and might change in future releases.
  - improved handling of test markers and refined marking mechanism:
      - "-m markexpr" option for selecting tests according to their mark
      - a new "markers" ini-variable for registering test markers for your project
      - the new "--strict" bails out with an error if using unregistered markers.
      - see examples at <http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/markers.html>
  - duration profiling: new "--duration=N" option showing the N slowest test execution or setup/teardown calls. This is most useful if you want to find out where your slowest test code is.
  - also 2.2.0 performs more eager calling of teardown/finalizers functions resulting in better and more accurate reporting when they fail

Besides there is the usual set of bug fixes along with a cleanup of pytest's own test suite allowing it to run on a wider range of environments.

For general information, see extensive docs with examples here:

> <http://pytest.org/>

If you want to install or upgrade pytest you might just type:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt, David Burns, Jeff Donner, Daniel Nouri, Alfredo Deza and all who gave feedback or sent bug reports.

best, holger krekel

## notes on incompatibility

While test suites should work unchanged you might need to upgrade plugins:

  - You need a new version of the pytest-xdist plugin (1.7) for distributing test runs.
  - Other plugins might need an upgrade if they implement the `pytest_runtest_logreport` hook which now is called unconditionally for the setup/teardown fixture phases of a test. You may choose to ignore setup/teardown failures by inserting "if rep.when \!= 'call': return" or something similar. Note that most code probably "just" works because the hook was already called for failing setup/teardown phases of a test so a plugin should have been ready to grok such reports already.

## Changes between 2.1.3 and 2.2.0

  - fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that teardown function are called earlier.
  - add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore from independent plugins and places.
  - add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily call a test function with different argument values.
  - Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
  - introduce registration for "pytest.mark.\*" helpers via ini-files or through plugin hooks. Also introduce a "--strict" option which will treat unregistered markers as errors allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers for your test suite. See examples at <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/mark.html> and its links.
  - issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers (this is a stricter and more predictable version of "-k" in that "-m" only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or semantics.
  - new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests: --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls and setup/teardown methods.
  - fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
  - fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
  - fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs
  - fix issue83: link to generated funcarg list

To install or upgrade pytest:

> pip install -U pytest \# or easy\_install -U pytest

Special thanks for helping on this release to Ronny Pfannschmidt, Jurko Gospodnetic and Ralf Schmitt.

best, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.2.0 and 2.2.1

  - fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest\_internalerror input arguments.
  - fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
  - fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns": the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for the good reporting and feedback. The pytest\_runtest\_protocol as well as the pytest\_runtest\_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
  - fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)

# pytest-2.3: improved fixtures / better unittest integration

pytest-2.3 comes with many major improvements for fixture/funcarg management and parametrized testing in Python. It is now easier, more efficient and more predictable to re-run the same tests with different fixture instances. Also, you can directly declare the caching "scope" of fixtures so that dependent tests throughout your whole test suite can reuse database or other expensive fixture objects with ease. Lastly, it's possible for fixture functions (formerly known as funcarg factories) to use other fixtures, allowing for a completely modular and reusable fixture design.

For detailed info and tutorial-style examples, see:

> <http://pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html>

Moreover, there is now support for using pytest fixtures/funcargs with unittest-style suites, see here for examples:

> <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/unittest.html>

Besides, more unittest-test suites are now expected to "simply work" with pytest.

All changes are backward compatible and you should be able to continue to run your test suites and 3rd party plugins that worked with pytest-2.2.4.

If you are interested in the precise reasoning (including examples) of the pytest-2.3 fixture evolution, please consult <http://pytest.org/en/stable/funcarg_compare.html>

For general info on installation and getting started:

> <http://pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html>

Docs and PDF access as usual at:

> <http://pytest.org>

and more details for those already in the knowing of pytest can be found in the CHANGELOG below.

Particular thanks for this release go to Floris Bruynooghe, Alex Okrushko Carl Meyer, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Benjamin Peterson and Alex Gaynor for helping to get the new features right and well integrated. Ronny and Floris also helped to fix a number of bugs and yet more people helped by providing bug reports.

have fun, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.2.4 and 2.3.0

  - fix issue202 - better automatic names for parametrized test functions

  - fix issue139 - introduce @pytest.fixture which allows direct scoping and parametrization of funcarg factories. Introduce new @pytest.setup marker to allow the writing of setup functions which accept funcargs.

  - fix issue198 - conftest fixtures were not found on windows32 in some circumstances with nested directory structures due to path manipulation issues

  - fix issue193 skip test functions with were parametrized with empty parameter sets

  - fix python3.3 compat, mostly reporting bits that previously depended on dict ordering

  - introduce re-ordering of tests by resource and parametrization setup which takes precedence to the usual file-ordering

  - fix issue185 monkeypatching time.time does not cause pytest to fail

  - fix issue172 duplicate call of pytest.setup-decoratored setup\_module functions

  - fix junitxml=path construction so that if tests change the current working directory and the path is a relative path it is constructed correctly from the original current working dir.

  - fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return

  - fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ

  - catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing

  - fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get>

  - always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

  - fix issue160: a failing setup of an xfail-marked tests should be reported as xfail (not xpass)

  - fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

  - fix issue179: properly show the dependency chain of factories

  - pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

  - fix issue159: improve <https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.1/faq.html> especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

  - make request.keywords and node.keywords writable. All descendant collection nodes will see keyword values. Keywords are dictionaries containing markers and other info.

  - fix issue 178: xml binary escapes are now wrapped in py.xml.raw

  - fix issue 176: correctly catch the builtin AssertionError even when we replaced AssertionError with a subclass on the python level

  - factory discovery no longer fails with magic global callables that provide no sane \_\_code\_\_ object (mock.call for example)

  - fix issue 182: testdir.inprocess\_run now considers passed plugins

  -   - fix issue 188: ensure sys.exc\_info is clear on python2  
        before calling into a test

  - fix issue 191: add unittest TestCase runTest method support

  - fix issue 156: monkeypatch correctly handles class level descriptors

  - reporting refinements:
    
      - pytest\_report\_header now receives a "startdir" so that you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show nice relative path
      - allow plugins to implement both pytest\_report\_header and pytest\_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).
      - don't show deselected reason line if there is none
      - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisons instead of truncating

# pytest-2.3.3: integration fixes, py24 support, `*/**` shown in traceback

pytest-2.3.3 is another stabilization release of the py.test tool which offers uebersimple assertions, scalable fixture mechanisms and deep customization for testing with Python. Particularly, this release provides:

  - integration fixes and improvements related to flask, numpy, nose, unittest, mock
  - makes pytest work on py24 again (yes, people sometimes still need to use it)
  - show `*,**` args in pytest tracebacks

Thanks to Manuel Jacob, Thomas Waldmann, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Pavel Repin and Andreas Taumoefolau for providing patches and all for the issues.

## Changes between 2.3.2 and 2.3.3

  - fix issue214 - parse modules that contain special objects like e. g. flask's request object which blows up on getattr access if no request is active. thanks Thomas Waldmann.
  - fix issue213 - allow to parametrize with values like numpy arrays that do not support an \_\_eq\_\_ operator
  - fix issue215 - split test\_python.org into multiple files
  - fix issue148 - @unittest.skip on classes is now recognized and avoids calling setUpClass/tearDownClass, thanks Pavel Repin

  - nose support: only call setup if it's a callable, thanks Andrew Taumoefolau
  - fix issue219 - add py2.4-3.3 classifiers to TROVE list
  - in tracebacks *,*\* arg values are now shown next to normal arguments (thanks Manuel Jacob)
  - fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.
  - fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest\_addoption() and add a `config.getoption(name)` helper function for consistency.

# pytest-2.3.4: stabilization, more flexible selection via "-k expr"

pytest-2.3.4 is a small stabilization release of the py.test tool which offers uebersimple assertions, scalable fixture mechanisms and deep customization for testing with Python. This release comes with the following fixes and features:

  - make "-k" option accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc. This is a slight usage incompatibility if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test\_method" which you now need to write as -k "TestClass and test\_method" to match a certain method in a certain test class.
  - allow to dynamically define markers via item.keywords\[...\]=assignment integrating with "-m" option
  - yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see: <http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html>
  - fix autouse-issue where autouse-fixtures would not be discovered if defined in an a/conftest.py file and tests in a/tests/test\_some.py
  - fix issue226 - LIFO ordering for fixture teardowns
  - fix issue224 - invocations with \>256 char arguments now work
  - fix issue91 - add/discuss package/directory level setups in example
  - fixes related to autouse discovery and calling

Thanks in particular to Thomas Waldmann for spotting and reporting issues.

# pytest-2.3.5: bug fixes and little improvements

pytest-2.3.5 is a maintenance release with many bug fixes and little improvements. See the changelog below for details. No backward compatibility issues are foreseen and all plugins which worked with the prior version are expected to work unmodified. Speaking of which, a few interesting new plugins saw the light last month:

  - pytest-instafail: show failure information while tests are running
  - pytest-qt: testing of GUI applications written with QT/Pyside
  - pytest-xprocess: managing external processes across test runs
  - pytest-random: randomize test ordering

And several others like pytest-django saw maintenance releases. For a more complete list, check out <https://pypi.org/search/?q=pytest>

To install or upgrade pytest:

> pip install -U pytest \# or easy\_install -U pytest

Particular thanks to Floris, Ronny, Benjamin and the many bug reporters and fix providers.

may the fixtures be with you, holger krekel

## Changes between 2.3.4 and 2.3.5

  - never consider a fixture function for test function collection
  - allow re-running of test items / helps to fix pytest-reruntests plugin and also help to keep less fixture/resource references alive
  - put captured stdout/stderr into junitxml output even for passing tests (thanks Adam Goucher)
  - Issue 265 - integrate nose setup/teardown with setupstate so it doesn't try to teardown if it did not setup

  - issue 259 - when assertion rewriting, be consistent with the default source encoding of ASCII on Python 2
  - issue 251 - report a skip instead of ignoring classes with init
  - issue250 unicode/str mixes in parametrization names and values now works
  - issue257, assertion-triggered compilation of source ending in a comment line doesn't blow up in python2.5 (fixed through py\>=1.4.13.dev6)
  - fix --genscript option to generate standalone scripts that also work with python3.3 (importer ordering)
  - issue171 - in assertion rewriting, show the repr of some global variables
  - fix option help for "-k"
  - move long description of distribution into README.rst
  - improve docstring for metafunc.parametrize()

# pytest-2.4.0: new fixture features/hooks and bug fixes

The just released pytest-2.4.0 brings many improvements and numerous bug fixes while remaining plugin- and test-suite compatible apart from a few supposedly very minor incompatibilities. See below for a full list of details. A few feature highlights:

  - new yield-style fixtures [pytest.yield\_fixture](http://pytest.org/en/stable/yieldfixture.html), allowing to use existing with-style context managers in fixture functions.
  - improved pdb support: `import pdb ; pdb.set_trace()` now works without requiring prior disabling of stdout/stderr capturing. Also the `--pdb` options works now on collection and internal errors and we introduced a new experimental hook for IDEs/plugins to intercept debugging: `pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)`.
  - shorter monkeypatch variant to allow specifying an import path as a target, for example: `monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)`
  - better unittest/nose compatibility: all teardown methods are now only called if the corresponding setup method succeeded.
  - integrate tab-completion on command line options if you have `argcomplete` configured.
  - allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail if a "reason" is also specified.
  - a new hook `pytest_load_initial_conftests` allows plugins like `pytest-django` to influence the environment before conftest files import `django`.
  - reporting: color the last line red or green depending if failures/errors occurred or everything passed.

The documentation has been updated to accommodate the changes, see <http://pytest.org>

To install or upgrade pytest:

    pip install -U pytest # or
    easy_install -U pytest

**Many thanks to all who helped, including Floris Bruynooghe, Brianna Laugher, Andreas Pelme, Anthon van der Neut, Anatoly Bubenkoff, Vladimir Keleshev, Mathieu Agopian, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Christian Theunert and many others.**

may passing tests be with you,

holger krekel

## Changes between 2.3.5 and 2.4

known incompatibilities:

  - if calling --genscript from python2.7 or above, you only get a standalone script which works on python2.7 or above. Use Python2.6 to also get a python2.5 compatible version.
  - all xunit-style teardown methods (nose-style, pytest-style, unittest-style) will not be called if the corresponding setup method failed, see issue322 below.
  - the pytest\_plugin\_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed.
  - pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use yield) anymore. This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes unforeseen real-life issues. However, you can always write and return an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate over the returned generator. This change was done in lieu of the new `pytest.yield_fixture` decorator, see below.

new features:

  - experimentally introduce a new `pytest.yield_fixture` decorator which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but mandates a `yield` statement instead of a `return statement` from fixture functions. This allows direct integration with "with-style" context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the "after-yield" as teardown code. Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions.

  - allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail if a "reason" is also specified. Rework skipping documentation to recommend "condition as booleans" because it prevents surprises when importing markers between modules. Specifying conditions as strings will remain fully supported.

  - reporting: color the last line red or green depending if failures/errors occurred or everything passed. thanks Christian Theunert.

  - make "import pdb ; pdb.set\_trace()" work natively wrt capturing (no "-s" needed anymore), making `pytest.set_trace()` a mere shortcut.

  - fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and on internal errors) . This was implemented by a slight internal refactoring and the introduction of a new hook `pytest_exception_interact` hook (see next item).

  - fix issue341: introduce new experimental hook for IDEs/terminals to intercept debugging: `pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)`.

  - new monkeypatch.setattr() variant to provide a shorter invocation for patching out classes/functions from modules:
    
    > monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)
    
    will replace the "get" function of the "requests" module with `myfunc`.

  - fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix. Also make all of pytest/nose finalizer mimic the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and fails, don't run teardownX. This internally introduces a new method "node.addfinalizer()" helper which can only be called during the setup phase of a node.

  - simplify pytest.mark.parametrize() signature: allow to pass a CSV-separated string to specify argnames. For example: `pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected",  [(1,2), (2,3)])` works as well as the previous: `pytest.mark.parametrize(("input", "expected"), ...)`.

  - add support for setUpModule/tearDownModule detection, thanks Brian Okken.

  - integrate tab-completion on options through use of "argcomplete". Thanks Anthon van der Neut for the PR.

  - change option names to be hyphen-separated long options but keep the old spelling backward compatible. py.test -h will only show the hyphenated version, for example "--collect-only" but "--collectonly" will remain valid as well (for backward-compat reasons). Many thanks to Anthon van der Neut for the implementation and to Hynek Schlawack for pushing us.

  - fix issue 308 - allow to mark/xfail/skip individual parameter sets when parametrizing. Thanks Brianna Laugher.

  - call new experimental pytest\_load\_initial\_conftests hook to allow 3rd party plugins to do something before a conftest is loaded.

Bug fixes:

  - fix issue358 - capturing options are now parsed more properly by using a new parser.parse\_known\_args method.
  - pytest now uses argparse instead of optparse (thanks Anthon) which means that "argparse" is added as a dependency if installing into python2.6 environments or below.
  - fix issue333: fix a case of bad unittest/pytest hook interaction.
  - PR27: correctly handle nose.SkipTest during collection. Thanks Antonio Cuni, Ronny Pfannschmidt.
  - fix issue355: junitxml puts name="pytest" attribute to testsuite tag.
  - fix issue336: autouse fixture in plugins should work again.
  - fix issue279: improve object comparisons on assertion failure for standard datatypes and recognise collections.abc. Thanks to Brianna Laugher and Mathieu Agopian.
  - fix issue317: assertion rewriter support for the is\_package method
  - fix issue335: document py.code.ExceptionInfo() object returned from pytest.raises(), thanks Mathieu Agopian.
  - remove implicit distribute\_setup support from setup.py.
  - fix issue305: ignore any problems when writing pyc files.
  - SO-17664702: call fixture finalizers even if the fixture function partially failed (finalizers would not always be called before)
  - fix issue320 - fix class scope for fixtures when mixed with module-level functions. Thanks Anatoly Bubenkoff.
  - you can specify "-q" or "-qq" to get different levels of "quieter" reporting (thanks Katarzyna Jachim)
  - fix issue300 - Fix order of conftest loading when starting py.test in a subdirectory.
  - fix issue323 - sorting of many module-scoped arg parametrizations
  - make sessionfinish hooks execute with the same cwd-context as at session start (helps fix plugin behaviour which write output files with relative path such as pytest-cov)
  - fix issue316 - properly reference collection hooks in docs
  - fix issue 306 - cleanup of -k/-m options to only match markers/test names/keywords respectively. Thanks Wouter van Ackooy.
  - improved doctest counting for doctests in python modules --files without any doctest items will not show up anymore and doctest examples are counted as separate test items. thanks Danilo Bellini.
  - fix issue245 by depending on the released py-1.4.14 which fixes py.io.dupfile to work with files with no mode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs.
  - fix junitxml generation when test output contains control characters, addressing issue267, thanks Jaap Broekhuizen
  - fix issue338: honor --tb style for setup/teardown errors as well. Thanks Maho.
  - fix issue307 - use yaml.safe\_load in example, thanks Mark Eichin.
  - better parametrize error messages, thanks Brianna Laugher
  - pytest\_terminal\_summary(terminalreporter) hooks can now use ".section(title)" and ".line(msg)" methods to print extra information at the end of a test run.

# pytest-2.4.1: fixing three regressions compared to 2.3.5

pytest-2.4.1 is a quick follow up release to fix three regressions compared to 2.3.5 before they hit more people:

  - When using parser.addoption() unicode arguments to the "type" keyword should also be converted to the respective types. thanks Floris Bruynooghe, @dnozay. (fixes issue360 and issue362)
  - fix dotted filename completion when using argcomplete thanks Anthon van der Neuth. (fixes issue361)
  - fix regression when a 1-tuple ("arg",) is used for specifying parametrization (the values of the parametrization were passed nested in a tuple). Thanks Donald Stufft.
  - also merge doc typo fixes, thanks Andy Dirnberger

# pytest-2.4.2: colorama on windows, plugin/tmpdir fixes

pytest-2.4.2 is another bug-fixing release:

  - on Windows require colorama and a newer py lib so that py.io.TerminalWriter() now uses colorama instead of its own ctypes hacks. (fixes issue365) thanks Paul Moore for bringing it up.
  - fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.
  - avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially when parametrization is used (issue354)
  - fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.) Thanks Andi Zeidler.
  - introduce node.get\_marker/node.add\_marker API for plugins like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy details of the node.keywords pseudo-dicts. Adapted docs.
  - remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky. the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities of tests messing up standard FDs.
  - add pluginmanager.do\_configure(config) as a link to config.do\_configure() for plugin-compatibility

as usual, docs at <http://pytest.org> and upgrades via:

# pytest-2.5.0: now down to ZERO reported bugs\!

pytest-2.5.0 is a big fixing release, the result of two community bug fixing days plus numerous additional works from many people and reporters. The release should be fully compatible to 2.4.2, existing plugins and test suites. We aim at maintaining this level of ZERO reported bugs because it's no fun if your testing tool has bugs, is it? Under a condition, though: when submitting a bug report please provide clear information about the circumstances and a simple example which reproduces the problem.

The issue tracker is of course not empty now. We have many remaining "enhancement" issues which we'll hopefully can tackle in 2014 with your help.

For those who use older Python versions, please note that pytest is not automatically tested on python2.5 due to virtualenv, setuptools and tox not supporting it anymore. Manual verification shows that it mostly works fine but it's not going to be part of the automated release process and thus likely to break in the future.

As usual, current docs are at

> <http://pytest.org>

and you can upgrade from pypi via:

    pip install -U pytest

Particular thanks for helping with this release go to Anatoly Bubenkoff, Floris Bruynooghe, Marc Abramowitz, Ralph Schmitt, Ronny Pfannschmidt, Donald Stufft, James Lan, Rob Dennis, Jason R. Coombs, Mathieu Agopian, Virgil Dupras, Bruno Oliveira, Alex Gaynor and others.

## 2.5.0

  - dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works with this release we believe).

  - simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved. finalization is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase". While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code. User-level code should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest\_runtest\_teardown hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway).

  - PR90: add --color=yesauto option to force terminal coloring mode ("auto" is default). Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

  - fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors. Many thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR. Also means we depend on py\>=1.4.19 now.

  - fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized tests independently from number of methods on the class.

  - refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead to problems for more than \>966 non-function scoped parameters).

  - fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing with repeated same values (sometimes useful to test if calling a second time works as with the first time).

  - close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it interacts with PEP420-namespace packages.

  - fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture. (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of this sentence :) Thanks Ralph Schmitt for the precise failure example.

  - fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use indices for parametrized test ids

  - fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will still have failed. We reraise the first failing exception because it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.

  - fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings are used with test methods. This fixes issue346 and should help with random "xdist" collection failures. Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.

  - fix issue357 - special case "-k" expressions to allow for filtering with simple strings that are not valid python expressions. Examples: "-k 1.3" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3. "-k None" filters all tests that have "None" in their name and conversely "-k 'not None'". Previously these examples would raise syntax errors.

  - fix issue384 by removing the trial support code since the unittest compat enhancements allow trial to handle it on its own

  - don't hide an ImportError when importing a plugin produces one. fixes issue375.

  - fix issue275 - allow usefixtures and autouse fixtures for running doctest text files.

  - fix issue380 by making --resultlog only rely on longrepr instead of the "reprcrash" attribute which only exists sometimes.

  - address issue122: allow @pytest.fixture(params=iterator) by exploding into a list early on.

  - fix pexpect-3.0 compatibility for pytest's own tests. (fixes issue386)

  - allow nested parametrize-value markers, thanks James Lan for the PR.

  - fix unicode handling with new monkeypatch.setattr(import\_path, value) API. Thanks Rob Dennis. Fixes issue371.

  - fix unicode handling with junitxml, fixes issue368.

  - In assertion rewriting mode on Python 2, fix the detection of coding cookies. See issue \#330.

  - make "--runxfail" turn imperative pytest.xfail calls into no ops (it already did neutralize pytest.mark.xfail markers)

  - refine pytest / pkg\_resources interactions: The AssertionRewritingHook PEP302 compliant loader now registers itself with setuptools/pkg\_resources properly so that the pkg\_resources.resource\_stream method works properly. Fixes issue366. Thanks for the investigations and full PR to Jason R. Coombs.

  - pytestconfig fixture is now session-scoped as it is the same object during the whole test run. Fixes issue370.

  - avoid one surprising case of marker malfunction/confusion:
    
        @pytest.mark.some(lambda arg: ...)
        def test_function():
    
    would not work correctly because pytest assumes @pytest.mark.some gets a function to be decorated already. We now at least detect if this arg is a lambda and thus the example will work. Thanks Alex Gaynor for bringing it up.

  - xfail a test on pypy that checks wrong encoding/ascii (pypy does not error out). fixes issue385.

  - internally make varnames() deal with classes's \_\_init\_\_, although it's not needed by pytest itself atm. Also fix caching. Fixes issue376.

  - fix issue221 - handle importing of namespace-package with no \_\_init\_\_.py properly.

  - refactor internal FixtureRequest handling to avoid monkeypatching. One of the positive user-facing effects is that the "request" object can now be used in closures.

  - fixed version comparison in pytest.importskip(modname, minverstring)

  - fix issue377 by clarifying in the nose-compat docs that pytest does not duplicate the unittest-API into the "plain" namespace.

  - fix verbose reporting for @mock'd test functions

# pytest-2.5.1: fixes and new home page styling

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1000 tests against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

The 2.5.1 release maintains the "zero-reported-bugs" promise by fixing the three bugs reported since the last release a few days ago. It also features a new home page styling implemented by Tobias Bieniek, based on the flask theme from Armin Ronacher:

> <http://pytest.org>

If you have anything more to improve styling and docs, we'd be very happy to merge further pull requests.

On the coding side, the release also contains a little enhancement to fixture decorators allowing to directly influence generation of test ids, thanks to Floris Bruynooghe. Other thanks for helping with this release go to Anatoly Bubenkoff and Ronny Pfannschmidt.

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via:

    pip install -U pytest

have fun and a nice remaining "bug-free" time of the year :) holger krekel

## 2.5.1

  - merge new documentation styling PR from Tobias Bieniek.
  - fix issue403: allow parametrize of multiple same-name functions within a collection node. Thanks Andreas Kloeckner and Alex Gaynor for reporting and analysis.
  - Allow parameterized fixtures to specify the ID of the parameters by adding an ids argument to pytest.fixture() and pytest.yield\_fixture(). Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - fix issue404 by always using the binary xml escape in the junitxml plugin. Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt.
  - fix issue407: fix addoption docstring to point to argparse instead of optparse. Thanks Daniel D. Wright.

## 2.5.2

  - fix issue409 -- better interoperate with cx\_freeze by not trying to import from collections.abc which causes problems for py27/cx\_freeze. Thanks Wolfgang L. for reporting and tracking it down.
  - fixed docs and code to use "pytest" instead of "py.test" almost everywhere. Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the complete PR.
  - fix issue425: mention at end of "py.test -h" that --markers and --fixtures work according to specified test path (or current dir)
  - fix issue413: exceptions with unicode attributes are now printed correctly also on python2 and with pytest-xdist runs. (the fix requires py-1.4.20)
  - copy, cleanup and integrate py.io capture from pylib 1.4.20.dev2 (rev 13d9af95547e)
  - address issue416: clarify docs as to conftest.py loading semantics
  - fix issue429: comparing byte strings with non-ascii chars in assert expressions now work better. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - make capfd/capsys.capture private, its unused and shouldn't be exposed

# pytest-2.6.0: shorter tracebacks, new warning system, test runner compat

pytest is a mature Python testing tool with more than 1000 tests against itself, passing on many different interpreters and platforms.

The 2.6.0 release should be drop-in backward compatible to 2.5.2 and fixes a number of bugs and brings some new features, mainly:

  - shorter tracebacks by default: only the first (test function) entry and the last (failure location) entry are shown, the ones between only in "short" format. Use `--tb=long` to get back the old behaviour of showing "long" entries everywhere.
  - a new warning system which reports oddities during collection and execution. For example, ignoring collecting Test\* classes with an `__init__` now produces a warning.
  - various improvements to nose/mock/unittest integration

Note also that 2.6.0 departs with the "zero reported bugs" policy because it has been too hard to keep up with it, unfortunately. Instead we are for now rather bound to work on "upvoted" issues in the <https://bitbucket.org/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?status=new&status=open&sort=-votes> issue tracker.

See docs at:

> <http://pytest.org>

As usual, you can upgrade from pypi via:

    pip install -U pytest

Thanks to all who contributed, among them:

> Benjamin Peterson Jurko Gospodnetić Floris Bruynooghe Marc Abramowitz Marc Schlaich Trevor Bekolay Bruno Oliveira Alex Groenholm

have fun, holger krekel

## 2.6.0

  - fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default. Thanks Benjamin Peterson.
  - fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default. The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks for the first and last entry. You can get the old behaviour of printing all entries as long entries with "--tb=long". Also short entries by default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.
  - fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes Thanks Benjamin Peterson.
  - change -v output to include full node IDs of tests. Users can copy a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a positional argument in order to run only a single test.
  - fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling pytest.raises with wrong exception type.
  - fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.
  - cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the PR.
  - change XPASS colour to yellow rather than red when tests are run with -v.
  - fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class dict when double-patching.
  - fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that the fixture is still invalidated.
  - fix issue453: the result of the pytest\_assertrepr\_compare hook now gets it's newlines escaped so that format\_exception does not blow up.
  - internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when it detects oddities in your test collection or execution. Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest\_logwarning hook which is currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on warnings) is specified.
  - change skips into warnings for test classes with an \_\_init\_\_ and callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.
  - fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command line arguments by using the result of parse\_known\_args rather than the previous flaky heuristics. Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests and initial fixing approaches in this area.
  - fix issue \#479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions during collection/loading of test modules. Thanks to Marc Schlaich for the complete PR.
  - fix issue490: include pytest\_load\_initial\_conftests in documentation and improve docstring.
  - fix issue472: clarify that `pytest.config.getvalue()` cannot work if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.
  - merge PR123: improved integration with mock.patch decorator on tests.
  - fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now captured without crashes.
  - fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly. Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.
  - improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test" which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you can pass additional options as a quoted string. Thanks Trevor Bekolay.
  - simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.
  - improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs from Marc Abramowitz
  - fix issue492: avoid leak in test\_writeorg. Thanks Marc Abramowitz.
  - fix issue493: don't run tests in doc directory with `python setup.py test` (use tox -e doctesting for that)
  - fix issue486: better reporting and handling of early conftest loading failures
  - some cleanup and simplification of internal conftest handling.
  - work a bit harder to break reference cycles when catching exceptions. Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic.
  - fix issue443: fix skip examples to use proper comparison. Thanks Alex Groenholm.
  - support nose-style `__test__` attribute on modules, classes and functions, including unittest-style Classes. If set to False, the test will not be collected.
  - fix issue512: show "\<notset\>" for arguments which might not be set in monkeypatch plugin. Improves output in documentation.
  - avoid importing "py.test" (an old alias module for "pytest")

# Changes 2.6.1

  - No longer show line numbers in the --verbose output, the output is now purely the nodeid. The line number is still shown in failure reports. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - fix issue437 where assertion rewriting could cause pytest-xdist worker nodes to collect different tests. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - fix issue555: add "errors" attribute to capture-streams to satisfy some distutils and possibly other code accessing sys.stdout.errors.
  - fix issue547 capsys/capfd also work when output capturing ("-s") is disabled.
  - address issue170: allow pytest.mark.xfail(...) to specify expected exceptions via an optional "raises=EXC" argument where EXC can be a single exception or a tuple of exception classes. Thanks David Mohr for the complete PR.
  - fix integration of pytest with unittest.mock.patch decorator when it uses the "new" argument. Thanks Nicolas Delaby for test and PR.
  - fix issue with detecting conftest files if the arguments contain "::" node id specifications (copy pasted from "-v" output)
  - fix issue544 by only removing "@NUM" at the end of "::" separated parts and if the part has a ".py" extension
  - don't use py.std import helper, rather import things directly. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

  - fix conftest related fixture visibility issue: when running with a CWD outside of a test package pytest would get fixture discovery wrong. Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring for figuring out a reproducible example.
  - Introduce pytest\_enter\_pdb hook (needed e.g. by pytest\_timeout to cancel the timeout when interactively entering pdb). Thanks Wolfgang Schnerring.
  - check xfail/skip also with non-python function test items. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

## 2.7.0 (compared to 2.6.4)

  - fix issue435: make reload() work when assert rewriting is active. Thanks Daniel Hahler.
  - fix issue616: conftest.py files and their contained fixtures are now properly considered for visibility, independently from the exact current working directory and test arguments that are used. Many thanks to Eric Siegerman and his PR235 which contains systematic tests for conftest visibility and now passes. This change also introduces the concept of a `rootdir` which is printed as a new pytest header and documented in the pytest customize web page.
  - change reporting of "diverted" tests, i.e. tests that are collected in one file but actually come from another (e.g. when tests in a test class come from a base class in a different file). We now show the nodeid and indicate via a postfix the other file.
  - add ability to set command line options by environment variable PYTEST\_ADDOPTS.
  - added documentation on the new pytest-dev teams on bitbucket and github. See <https://pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html> . Thanks to Anatoly for pushing and initial work on this.
  - fix issue650: new option `--doctest-ignore-import-errors` which will turn import errors in doctests into skips. Thanks Charles Cloud for the complete PR.
  - fix issue655: work around different ways that cause python2/3 to leak sys.exc\_info into fixtures/tests causing failures in 3rd party code
  - fix issue615: assertion rewriting did not correctly escape % signs when formatting boolean operations, which tripped over mixing booleans with modulo operators. Thanks to Tom Viner for the report, triaging and fix.
  - implement issue351: add ability to specify parametrize ids as a callable to generate custom test ids. Thanks Brianna Laugher for the idea and implementation.
  - introduce and document new hookwrapper mechanism useful for plugins which want to wrap the execution of certain hooks for their purposes. This supersedes the undocumented `__multicall__` protocol which pytest itself and some external plugins use. Note that pytest-2.8 is scheduled to drop supporting the old `__multicall__` and only support the hookwrapper protocol.
  - majorly speed up invocation of plugin hooks
  - use hookwrapper mechanism in builtin pytest plugins.
  - add a doctest ini option for doctest flags, thanks Holger Peters.
  - add note to docs that if you want to mark a parameter and the parameter is a callable, you also need to pass in a reason to disambiguate it from the "decorator" case. Thanks Tom Viner.
  - "python\_classes" and "python\_functions" options now support glob-patterns for test discovery, as discussed in issue600. Thanks Ldiary Translations.
  - allow to override parametrized fixtures with non-parametrized ones and vice versa (bubenkoff).
  - fix issue463: raise specific error for 'parameterize' misspelling (pfctdayelise).
  - On failure, the `sys.last_value`, `sys.last_type` and `sys.last_traceback` are set, so that a user can inspect the error via postmortem debugging (almarklein).

Happy testing, The py.test Development Team

## 2.9.0 (compared to 2.8.7)

**New Features**

  - New `pytest.mark.skip` mark, which unconditionally skips marked tests. Thanks `MichaelAquilina` for the complete PR (`1040`).
  - `--doctest-glob` may now be passed multiple times in the command-line. Thanks `jab` and `nicoddemus` for the PR.
  - New `-rp` and `-rP` reporting options give the summary and full output of passing tests, respectively. Thanks to `codewarrior0` for the PR.
  - `pytest.mark.xfail` now has a `strict` option which makes `XPASS` tests to fail the test suite, defaulting to `False`. There's also a `xfail_strict` ini option that can be used to configure it project-wise. Thanks `rabbbit` for the request and `nicoddemus` for the PR (`1355`).
  - `Parser.addini` now supports options of type `bool`. Thanks `nicoddemus` for the PR.
  - New `ALLOW_BYTES` doctest option strips `b` prefixes from byte strings in doctest output (similar to `ALLOW_UNICODE`). Thanks `jaraco` for the request and `nicoddemus` for the PR (`1287`).
  - give a hint on KeyboardInterrupt to use the --fulltrace option to show the errors, this fixes `1366`. Thanks to `hpk42` for the report and `RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.
  - catch IndexError exceptions when getting exception source location. This fixes pytest internal error for dynamically generated code (fixtures and tests) where source lines are fake by intention

**Changes**

  - **Important**: [py.code](https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html) has been merged into the `pytest` repository as `pytest._code`. This decision was made because `py.code` had very few uses outside `pytest` and the fact that it was in a different repository made it difficult to fix bugs on its code in a timely manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better refactor out and improve that code. This change shouldn't affect users, but it is useful to let users aware if they encounter any strange behavior.
    
    Keep in mind that the code for `pytest._code` is **private** and **experimental**, so you definitely should not import it explicitly\!
    
    Please note that the original `py.code` is still available in [pylib](https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

  - `pytest_enter_pdb` now optionally receives the pytest config object. Thanks `nicoddemus` for the PR.

  - Removed code and documentation for Python 2.5 or lower versions, including removal of the obsolete `_pytest.assertion.oldinterpret` module. Thanks `nicoddemus` for the PR (`1226`).

  - Comparisons now always show up in full when `CI` or `BUILD_NUMBER` is found in the environment, even when -vv isn't used. Thanks `The-Compiler` for the PR.

  - `--lf` and `--ff` now support long names: `--last-failed` and `--failed-first` respectively. Thanks `MichaelAquilina` for the PR.

  - Added expected exceptions to pytest.raises fail message

  - Collection only displays progress ("collecting X items") when in a terminal. This avoids cluttering the output when using `--color=yes` to obtain colors in CI integrations systems (`1397`).

**Bug Fixes**

  - The `-s` and `-c` options should now work under `xdist`; `Config.fromdictargs` now represents its input much more faithfully. Thanks to `bukzor` for the complete PR (`680`).
  - Fix (`1290`): support Python 3.5's `@` operator in assertion rewriting. Thanks `Shinkenjoe` for report with test case and `tomviner` for the PR.
  - Fix formatting utf-8 explanation messages (`1379`). Thanks `biern` for the PR.
  - Fix [traceback style docs](https://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/output.html#modifying-python-traceback-printing) to describe all of the available options (auto/long/short/line/native/no), with `auto` being the default since v2.6. Thanks `hackebrot` for the PR.
  - Fix (`1422`): junit record\_xml\_property doesn't allow multiple records with same name.

  - Fix (`469`): junit parses report.nodeid incorrectly, when params IDs contain `::`. Thanks `tomviner` for the PR (`1431`).
  - Fix (`578`): SyntaxErrors containing non-ascii lines at the point of failure generated an internal py.test error. Thanks `asottile` for the report and `nicoddemus` for the PR.

# python testing sprint June 20th-26th 2016

![image](../img/freiburg2.jpg)

The pytest core group held the biggest sprint in its history in June 2016, taking place in the black forest town Freiburg in Germany. In February 2016 we started a [funding campaign on Indiegogo to cover expenses](http://igg.me/at/pytest-sprint/x/4034848) The page also mentions some preliminary topics:

  - improving pytest-xdist test scheduling to take into account fixture setups and explicit user hints.
  - provide info on fixture dependencies during --collect-only
  - tying pytest-xdist to tox so that you can do "py.test -e py34" to run tests in a particular tox-managed virtualenv. Also look into making pytest-xdist use tox environments on remote ssh-sides so that remote dependency management becomes easier.
  - refactoring the fixture system so more people understand it :)
  - integrating PyUnit setup methods as autouse fixtures. possibly adding ways to influence ordering of same-scoped fixtures (so you can make a choice of which fixtures come before others)
  - fixing bugs and issues from the tracker, really an endless source :)

## Participants

Over 20 participants took part from 4 continents, including employees from Splunk, Personalkollen, Cobe.io, FanDuel and Dolby. Some newcomers mixed with developers who have worked on pytest since its beginning, and of course everyone in between.

## Sprint organisation, schedule

People arrived in Freiburg on the 19th, with sprint development taking place on 20th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 25th. On the 23rd we took a break day for some hot hiking in the Black Forest.

Sprint activity was organised heavily around pairing, with plenty of group discussions to take advantage of the high bandwidth, and lightning talks as well.

## Money / funding

The Indiegogo campaign aimed for 11000 USD and in the end raised over 12000, to reimburse travel costs, pay for a sprint venue and catering.

Excess money is reserved for further sprint/travel funding for pytest/tox contributors.

# Backwards Compatibility Policy

Pytest is an actively evolving project that has been decades in the making. We keep learning about new and better structures to express different details about testing.

While we implement those modifications, we try to ensure an easy transition and don't want to impose unnecessary churn on our users and community/plugin authors.

As of now, pytest considers multiple types of backward compatibility transitions:

1)  trivial: APIs that trivially translate to the new mechanism and do not cause problematic changes.
    
    We try to support those indefinitely while encouraging users to switch to newer or better mechanisms through documentation.

2)  transitional: the old and new APIs don't conflict, and we can help users transition by using warnings while supporting both for a prolonged period of time.
    
    We will only start the removal of deprecated functionality in major releases (e.g., if we deprecate something in 3.0, we will start to remove it in 4.0), and keep it around for at least two minor releases (e.g., if we deprecate something in 3.9 and 4.0 is the next release, we start to remove it in 5.0, not in 4.0).
    
    A deprecated feature scheduled to be removed in major version X will use the warning class <span class="title-ref">PytestRemovedInXWarning</span> (a subclass of <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning</span>).
    
    When the deprecation expires (e.g., 4.0 is released), we won't remove the deprecated functionality immediately but will use the standard warning filters to turn <span class="title-ref">PytestRemovedInXWarning</span> (e.g., <span class="title-ref">PytestRemovedIn4Warning</span>) into **errors** by default. This approach makes it explicit that removal is imminent and still gives you time to turn the deprecated feature into a warning instead of an error so it can be dealt with in your own time. In the next minor release (e.g., 4.1), the feature will be effectively removed.

3)  True breakage should only be considered when a normal transition is unreasonably unsustainable and would offset important developments or features by years. In addition, they should be limited to APIs where the number of actual users is very small (for example, only impacting some plugins) and can be coordinated with the community in advance.
    
    Examples for such upcoming changes:
    
      - removal of `pytest_runtest_protocol/nextitem` - `895`
      - rearranging of the node tree to include `FunctionDefinition`
      - rearranging of `SetupState` `895`
    
    True breakages must be announced first in an issue containing:
    
      - Detailed description of the change
      - Rationale
      - Expected impact on users and plugin authors (example in `895`)
    
    After there's no hard *-1* on the issue it should be followed up by an initial proof-of-concept Pull Request.
    
    This POC serves as both a coordination point to assess impact and potential inspiration to come up with a transitional solution after all.
    
    After a reasonable amount of time the PR can be merged to base a new major release.
    
    For the PR to mature from POC to acceptance, it must contain:
    
      - Setup of deprecation errors/warnings that help users fix and port their code. If it is possible to introduce a deprecation period under the current series, before the true breakage, it should be introduced in a separate PR and be part of the current release stream.
      - Detailed description of the rationale and examples on how to port code in `doc/en/deprecations.rst`.

# History

## Focus primary on smooth transition - stance (pre 6.0)

Keeping backwards compatibility has a very high priority in the pytest project. Although we have deprecated functionality over the years, most of it is still supported. All deprecations in pytest were done because simpler or more efficient ways of accomplishing the same tasks have emerged, making the old way of doing things unnecessary.

With the pytest 3.0 release, we introduced a clear communication scheme for when we will actually remove the old busted joint and politely ask you to use the new hotness instead, while giving you enough time to adjust your tests or raise concerns if there are valid reasons to keep deprecated functionality around.

To communicate changes, we issue deprecation warnings using a custom warning hierarchy (see \[internal-warnings\](\#internal-warnings)). These warnings may be suppressed using the standard means: `-W` command-line flag or `filterwarnings` ini options (see \[warnings\](\#warnings)), but we suggest to use these sparingly and temporarily, and heed the warnings when possible.

We will only start the removal of deprecated functionality in major releases (e.g. if we deprecate something in 3.0, we will start to remove it in 4.0), and keep it around for at least two minor releases (e.g. if we deprecate something in 3.9 and 4.0 is the next release, we start to remove it in 5.0, not in 4.0).

When the deprecation expires (e.g. 4.0 is released), we won't remove the deprecated functionality immediately, but will use the standard warning filters to turn them into **errors** by default. This approach makes it explicit that removal is imminent, and still gives you time to turn the deprecated feature into a warning instead of an error so it can be dealt with in your own time. In the next minor release (e.g. 4.1), the feature will be effectively removed.

### Deprecation Roadmap

Features currently deprecated and removed in previous releases can be found in \[deprecations\](\#deprecations).

We track future deprecation and removal of features using milestones and the [deprecation](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues?q=label%3A%22type%3A+deprecation%22) and [removal](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type%3A%20removal) labels on GitHub.

#### Improved documentation

  - [\#12663](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12663): Clarify that the <span class="title-ref">pytest\_deselected</span> hook should be called from <span class="title-ref">pytest\_collection\_modifyitems</span> hook implementations when items are deselected.

### pytest 8.3.1 (2024-07-20)

The 8.3.0 release failed to include the change notes and docs for the release. This patch release remedies this. There are no other changes.

### pytest 8.3.0 (2024-07-20)

#### New features

  - [\#12231](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12231): Added <span class="title-ref">--xfail-tb</span> flag, which turns on traceback output for XFAIL results.
    
      - If the <span class="title-ref">--xfail-tb</span> flag is not given, tracebacks for XFAIL results are NOT shown.
      - The style of traceback for XFAIL is set with <span class="title-ref">--tb</span>, and can be <span class="title-ref">auto|long|short|line|native|no</span>.
      - Note: Even if you have <span class="title-ref">--xfail-tb</span> set, you won't see them if <span class="title-ref">--tb=no</span>.
    
    Some history:
    
    With pytest 8.0, <span class="title-ref">-rx</span> or <span class="title-ref">-ra</span> would not only turn on summary reports for xfail, but also report the tracebacks for xfail results. This caused issues with some projects that utilize xfail, but don't want to see all of the xfail tracebacks.
    
    This change detaches xfail tracebacks from <span class="title-ref">-rx</span>, and now we turn on xfail tracebacks with <span class="title-ref">--xfail-tb</span>. With this, the default <span class="title-ref">-rx</span>/ <span class="title-ref">-ra</span> behavior is identical to pre-8.0 with respect to xfail tracebacks. While this is a behavior change, it brings default behavior back to pre-8.0.0 behavior, which ultimately was considered the better course of action.

  - [\#12281](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12281): Added support for keyword matching in marker expressions.
    
    Now tests can be selected by marker keyword arguments. Supported values are <span class="title-ref">int</span>, (unescaped) <span class="title-ref">str</span>, <span class="title-ref">bool</span> & <span class="title-ref">None</span>.
    
    See \[marker examples \<marker\_keyword\_expression\_example\>\](\#marker-examples-\<marker\_keyword\_expression\_example\>) for more information.

  - [\#12567](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12567): Added `--no-fold-skipped` command line option.
    
    If this option is set, then skipped tests in short summary are no longer grouped by reason but all tests are printed individually with their nodeid in the same way as other statuses.

#### Improvements in existing functionality

  - [\#12469](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469): The console output now uses the "third-party plugins" terminology, replacing the previously established but confusing and outdated reference to :std\[setuptools \<setuptools:index\>\](setuptools \<setuptools:index\>.md) -- by `webknjaz`.

  - [\#12544](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12544), [\#12545](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12545): Python virtual environment detection was improved by checking for a `pyvenv.cfg` file, ensuring reliable detection on various platforms -- by `zachsnickers`.

  - [\#2871](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/2871): Do not truncate arguments to functions in output when running with <span class="title-ref">-vvv</span>.

  - [\#389](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/389): The readability of assertion introspection of bound methods has been enhanced -- by `farbodahm`, `webknjaz`, `obestwalter`, `flub` and `glyphack`.
    
    Earlier, it was like:
    
      - \`\`\`console  
        \=================================== FAILURES =================================== \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_ test \_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_
        
        > def test():
        
        \> assert Help().fun() == 2 E assert 1 == 2 E + where 1 = \<bound method Help.fun of \<example.Help instance at 0x256a830\>\>() E + where \<bound method Help.fun of \<example.Help instance at 0x256a830\>\> = \<example.Help instance at 0x256a830\>.fun E + where \<example.Help instance at 0x256a830\> = Help()
        
        example.py:7: AssertionError =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================
    
    And now it's like:
    
    ``` console
    =================================== FAILURES ===================================
    _____________________________________ test _____________________________________
    
        def test():

    E        +  where 1 = fun()
    E        +    where fun = <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230>.fun
    E        +      where <test_local.Help object at 0x1074be230> = Help()
    
    test_local.py:13: AssertionError
    =========================== 1 failed in 0.03 seconds ===========================
    ```

  - [\#7662](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7662): Added timezone information to the testsuite timestamp in the JUnit XML report.

Bug fixes `` ` ---------  - `#11706 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11706>`_: Fixed reporting of teardown errors in higher-scoped fixtures when using `--maxfail` or `--stepwise`.    Originally added in pytest 8.0.0, but reverted in 8.0.2 due to a regression in pytest-xdist.   This regression was fixed in pytest-xdist 3.6.1.   - `#11797 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11797>`_: `pytest.approx` now correctly handles `Sequence <collections.abc.Sequence>`-like objects.   - `#12204 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12204>`_, `#12264 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12264>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0 where tracebacks get longer and longer when multiple   tests fail due to a shared higher-scope fixture which raised -- by :user:`bluetech`.    Also fixed a similar regression in pytest 5.4 for collectors which raise during setup.    The fix necessitated internal changes which may affect some plugins:    * ``FixtureDef.cached\_result\[2\]`is now a tuple`(exc, tb)`instead of`exc`.   *`SetupState.stack`failures are now a tuple`(exc, tb)`instead of`exc``.   - `#12275 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12275>`_: Fixed collection error upon encountering an :mod:`abstract <abc>` class, including abstract `unittest.TestCase` subclasses.   - `#12328 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12328>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where package-scoped parameterized items were not correctly reordered to minimize setups/teardowns in some cases.   - `#12424 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12424>`_: Fixed crash with `assert testcase is not None` assertion failure when re-running unittest tests using plugins like pytest-rerunfailures. Regressed in 8.2.2.   - `#12472 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12472>`_: Fixed a crash when returning category``"error"`or`"failed"``with a custom test status from :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook -- :user:`pbrezina`.   - `#12505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12505>`_: Improved handling of invalid regex patterns in `pytest.raises(match=r'...') <pytest.raises>` by providing a clear error message.   - `#12580 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12580>`_: Fixed a crash when using the cache class on Windows and the cache directory was created concurrently.   - `#6962 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6962>`_: Parametrization parameters are now compared using `==` instead of `is` (`is` is still used as a fallback if the parameter does not support `==`).   This fixes use of parameters such as lists, which have a different `id` but compare equal, causing fixtures to be re-computed instead of being cached.   - `#7166 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7166>`_: Fixed progress percentages (the``\[ 87%\]`at the edge of the screen) sometimes not aligning correctly when running with pytest-xdist`-n``.    Improved documentation ----------------------  - `#12153 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12153>`_: Documented using :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` to detect if code is running from within a pytest run.   - `#12469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12469>`_: The external plugin mentions in the documentation now avoid mentioning   :std[setuptools entry-points <setuptools:index>](setuptools entry-points <setuptools:index>.md) as the concept is   much more generic nowadays. Instead, the terminology of "external",   "installed", or "third-party" plugins (or packages) replaces that.    -- by :user:`webknjaz`   - `#12577 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12577>`_: `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables role is described in   the reference doc. They now also appear when doing `pytest -h`   -- by :user:`MarcBresson`.    Contributor-facing changes --------------------------  - `#12467 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12467>`_: Migrated all internal type-annotations to the python3.10+ style by using the `annotations` future import.    -- by :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt`   - `#11771 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11771>`_, `#12557 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12557>`_: The PyPy runtime version has been updated to 3.9 from 3.8 that introduced   a flaky bug at the garbage collector which was not expected to fix there   as the 3.8 is EoL.    -- by :user:`x612skm`   - `#12493 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12493>`_: The change log draft preview integration has been refactored to use a   third party extension``sphinxcontib-towncrier``. The previous in-repo   script was putting the change log preview file at   :file:`doc/en/_changelog_towncrier_draft.rst`. Said file is no longer   ignored in Git and might show up among untracked files in the   development environments of the contributors. To address that, the   contributors can run the following command that will clean it up:``\`console $ git clean -x -i -- doc/en/\_changelog\_towncrier\_draft.rst

  - [\#12498](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12498): All the undocumented `tox` environments now have descriptions. They can be listed in one's development environment by invoking `tox -av` in a terminal.

  - [\#12501](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12501): The changelog configuration has been updated to introduce more accurate audience-tailored categories. Previously, there was a `trivial` change log fragment type with an unclear and broad meaning. It was removed and we now have `contrib`, `misc` and `packaging` in place of it.
    
    The new change note types target the readers who are downstream packagers and project contributors. Additionally, the miscellaneous section is kept for unspecified updates that do not fit anywhere else.

  - [\#12502](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12502): The UX of the GitHub automation making pull requests to update the plugin list has been updated. Previously, the maintainers had to close the automatically created pull requests and re-open them to trigger the CI runs. From now on, they only need to click the <span class="title-ref">Ready for review</span> button instead.

  - [\#12522](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12522): The `:pull:` RST role has been replaced with a shorter `:pr:` due to starting to use the implementation from the third-party `sphinx-issues` Sphinx extension -- by `webknjaz`.

  - [\#12531](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12531): The coverage reporting configuration has been updated to exclude pytest's own tests marked as expected to fail from the coverage report. This has an effect of reducing the influence of flaky tests on the resulting number.
    
    \-- by `webknjaz`

  - [\#12533](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12533): The `extlinks` Sphinx extension is no longer enabled. The `:bpo:` role it used to declare has been removed with that. BPO itself has migrated to GitHub some years ago and it is possible to link the respective issues by using their GitHub issue numbers and the `:issue:` role that the `sphinx-issues` extension implements.

  - [\#12562](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12562): Possible typos in using the `:user:` RST role is now being linted through the pre-commit tool integration -- by `webknjaz`.

pytest 8.2.2 (2024-06-04) `` ` =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#12355 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12355>`_: Fix possible catastrophic performance slowdown on a certain parametrization pattern involving many higher-scoped parameters.   - `#12367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12367>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where unittest class instances (a fresh one is created for each test) were not released promptly on test teardown but only on session teardown.   - `#12381 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12381>`_: Fix possible "Directory not empty" crashes arising from concurrent cache dir ( ``.pytest\_cache``) creation. Regressed in pytest 8.2.0.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#12290 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12290>`_: Updated Sphinx theme to use Furo instead of Flask, enabling Dark mode theme.   - `#12356 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12356>`_: Added a subsection to the documentation for debugging flaky tests to mention   lack of thread safety in pytest as a possible source of flakiness.   - `#12363 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12363>`_: The documentation webpages now links to a canonical version to reduce outdated documentation in search engine results.   pytest 8.2.1 (2024-05-19) =========================  Improvements ------------  - `#12334 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12334>`_: Support for Python 3.13 (beta1 at the time of writing).    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#12120 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12120>`_: Fix `PermissionError` crashes arising from directories which are not selected on the command-line.   - `#12191 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12191>`_: Keyboard interrupts and system exits are now properly handled during the test collection.   - `#12300 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12300>`_: Fixed handling of 'Function not implemented' error under squashfuse_ll, which is a different way to say that the mountpoint is read-only.   - `#12308 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12308>`_: Fix a regression in pytest 8.2.0 where the permissions of automatically-created``.pytest\_cache`directories became`rwx------`instead of the expected`rwxr-xr-x``.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#12333 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12333>`_: pytest releases are now attested using the recent `Artifact Attestation <https://github.blog/2024-05-02-introducing-artifact-attestations-now-in-public-beta/>`_ support from GitHub, allowing users to verify the provenance of pytest's sdist and wheel artifacts.   pytest 8.2.0 (2024-04-27) =========================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - `#12089 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/12089>`_: pytest now requires that `unittest.TestCase` subclasses can be instantiated freely using``MyTestCase('runTest')`.    If the class doesn't allow this, you may see an error during collection such as`AttributeError: 'MyTestCase' object has no attribute 'runTest'`.    Classes which do not override`\_\_init\_\_`, or do not access the test method in`\_\_init\_\_`using`getattr`or similar, are unaffected.    Classes which do should take care to not crash when`"runTest"``is given, as is shown in `unittest.TestCases's implementation <https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/51aefc5bf907ddffaaf083ded0de773adcdf08c8/Lib/unittest/case.py#L419-L426>`_.   Alternatively, consider using `setUp <unittest.TestCase.setUp>` instead of``\_\_init\_\_`.    If you run into this issue using`tornado.AsyncTestCase``, please see `issue 12263 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12263>`_.    If you run into this issue using an abstract``TestCase``subclass, please see `issue 12275 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12275>`_.    Historical note: the effect of this change on custom TestCase implementations was not properly considered initially, this is why it was done in a minor release. We apologize for the inconvenience.  Deprecations ------------  - `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_: A deprecation warning is now raised when implementations of one of the following hooks request a deprecated``py.path.local`parameter instead of the`pathlib.Path``parameter which replaced it:    - :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` - the``path`parameter - use`collection\_path``instead.   - :hook:`pytest_collect_file` - the``path`parameter - use`file\_path``instead.   - :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule` - the``path`parameter - use`module\_path``instead.   - :hook:`pytest_report_header` - the``startdir`parameter - use`start\_path``instead.   - :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish` - the``startdir`parameter - use`start\_path``instead.    The replacement parameters are available since pytest 7.0.0.   The old parameters will be removed in pytest 9.0.0.    See [legacy-path-hooks-deprecated](#legacy-path-hooks-deprecated) for more details.    Features --------  - `#11871 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11871>`_: Added support for reading command line arguments from a file using the prefix character``@`, like e.g.:`pytest @tests.txt``. The file must have one argument per line.    See [Read arguments from file <args-from-file>](#read-arguments-from-file-<args-from-file>) for details.    Improvements ------------  - `#11523 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11523>`_: `pytest.importorskip` will now issue a warning if the module could be found, but raised `ImportError` instead of `ModuleNotFoundError`.    The warning can be suppressed by passing``exc\_type=ImportError``to `pytest.importorskip`.    See [import-or-skip-import-error](#import-or-skip-import-error) for details.   - `#11728 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11728>`_: For``unittest``-based tests, exceptions during class cleanup (as raised by functions registered with `TestCase.addClassCleanup <unittest.TestCase.addClassCleanup>`) are now reported instead of silently failing.   - `#11777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11777>`_: Text is no longer truncated in the``short test summary info`section when`-vv``is given.   - `#12112 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12112>`_: Improved namespace packages detection when :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` is enabled, covering more situations (like editable installs).   - `#9502 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9502>`_: Added :envvar:`PYTEST_VERSION` environment variable which is defined at the start of the pytest session and undefined afterwards. It contains the value of``pytest.\_\_version\_\_``, and among other things can be used to easily check if code is running from within a pytest run.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#12065 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12065>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 where test classes containing``setup\_method`and tests using`@staticmethod`or`@classmethod`would crash with`AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'setup\_method'``.    Now the `request.instance <pytest.FixtureRequest.instance>` attribute of tests using``@staticmethod`and`@classmethod`is no longer`None`, but a fresh instance of the class, like in non-static methods.   Previously it was`None`, and all fixtures of such tests would share a single`self``.   - `#12135 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12135>`_: Fixed issue where fixtures adding their finalizer multiple times to fixtures they request would cause unreliable and non-intuitive teardown ordering in some instances.   - `#12194 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12194>`_: Fixed a bug with``--importmode=importlib`and`--doctest-modules``where child modules did not appear as attributes in parent modules.   - `#1489 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1489>`_: Fixed some instances where teardown of higher-scoped fixtures was not happening in the reverse order they were initialized in.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_:``pluggy\>=1.5.0``is now required.   - `#12167 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12167>`_: [cache <cache>](#cache-<cache>): create supporting files (``CACHEDIR.TAG`,`.gitignore``, etc.) in a temporary directory to provide atomic semantics.   pytest 8.1.2 (2024-04-26) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#12114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12114>`_: Fixed error in `pytest.approx` when used with `numpy` arrays and comparing with other types.   pytest 8.1.1 (2024-03-08) =========================  > **Note** >         This release is not a usual bug fix release -- it contains features and improvements, being a follow up        to``8.1.0``, which has been yanked from PyPI.  Features --------  - `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: Added the new :confval:`consider_namespace_packages` configuration option, defaulting to``False`.    If set to`True``, pytest will attempt to identify modules that are part of `namespace packages <https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages>`__ when importing modules.   - `#11653 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11653>`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_test_cases` configuration option for fine-grained control of test execution verbosity.   See [Fine-grained verbosity <pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>](#fine-grained-verbosity-<pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>) for more details.    Improvements ------------  - `#10865 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10865>`_: `pytest.warns` now validates that `warnings.warn` was called with a `str` or a `Warning`.   Currently in Python it is possible to use other types, however this causes an exception when `warnings.filterwarnings` is used to filter those warnings (see `CPython #103577 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/103577>`__ for a discussion).   While this can be considered a bug in CPython, we decided to put guards in pytest as the error message produced without this check in place is confusing.   - `#11311 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11311>`_: When using``--override-ini``for paths in invocations without a configuration file defined, the current working directory is used   as the relative directory.    Previously this would raise an `AssertionError`.   - `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: [--import-mode=importlib <import-mode-importlib>](#--import-mode=importlib-<import-mode-importlib>) now tries to import modules using the standard import mechanism (but still without changing :py`sys.path`), falling back to importing modules directly only if that fails.    This means that installed packages will be imported under their canonical name if possible first, for example``app.core.models`, instead of having the module name always be derived from their path (for example`.env310.lib.site\_packages.app.core.models``).   - `#11801 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11801>`_: Added the `iter_parents() <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_parents>` helper method on nodes.   It is similar to `listchain <_pytest.nodes.Node.listchain>`, but goes from bottom to top, and returns an iterator, not a list.   - `#11850 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11850>`_: Added support for `sys.last_exc` for post-mortem debugging on Python>=3.12.   - `#11962 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11962>`_: In case no other suitable candidates for configuration file are found, a``pyproject.toml`(even without a`\[tool.pytest.ini\_options\]`table) will be considered as the configuration file and define the`rootdir``.   - `#11978 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11978>`_: Add``--log-file-mode`option to the logging plugin, enabling appending to log-files. This option accepts either`"w"`or`"a"`and defaults to`"w"`.    Previously, the mode was hard-coded to be`"w"``which truncates the file before logging.   - `#12047 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12047>`_: When multiple finalizers of a fixture raise an exception, now all exceptions are reported as an exception group.   Previously, only the first exception was reported.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#11475 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11475>`_: Fixed regression where``--importmode=importlib``would import non-test modules more than once.   - `#11904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11904>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 8.0.0 that would cause test collection to fail due to permission errors when using``--pyargs`.    This change improves the collection tree for tests specified using`--pyargs``, see :pr:`12043` for a comparison with pytest 8.0 and <8.   - `#12011 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12011>`_: Fixed a regression in 8.0.1 whereby``setup\_module`xunit-style fixtures are not executed when`--doctest-modules``is passed.   - `#12014 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12014>`_: Fix the``stacklevel``used when warning about marks used on fixtures.   - `#12039 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12039>`_: Fixed a regression in``8.0.2``where tests created using :fixture:`tmp_path` have been collected multiple times in CI under Windows.   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#11790 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11790>`_: Documented the retention of temporary directories created using the``tmp\_path``fixture in more detail.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#11785 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11785>`_: Some changes were made to private functions which may affect plugins which access them:    -``FixtureManager.\_getautousenames()`now takes a`Node`itself instead of the nodeid.   -`FixtureManager.getfixturedefs()`now takes the`Node`itself instead of the nodeid.   - The`\_pytest.nodes.iterparentnodeids()``function is removed without replacement.     Prefer to traverse the node hierarchy itself instead.     If you really need to, copy the function from the previous pytest release.   - `#12069 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/12069>`_: Delayed the deprecation of the following features to``9.0.0`:    * [node-ctor-fspath-deprecation](#node-ctor-fspath-deprecation).   * [legacy-path-hooks-deprecated](#legacy-path-hooks-deprecated).    It was discovered after`8.1.0`was released that the warnings about the impeding removal were not being displayed, so the team decided to revert the removal.    This is the reason for`8.1.0``being yanked.   pytest 8.1.0 (YANKED) =====================   > **Note** >         This release has been **yanked**: it broke some plugins without the proper warning period, due to        some warnings not showing up as expected.

NOTE: This change was reverted in pytest 8.0.2 to fix a `regression <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist/issues/1024>`_ it caused in pytest-xdist.   - `#11758 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11758>`_: Fixed``IndexError: string index out of range`crash in`if highlighted\[-1\] == "n" and source\[-1\] \!= "n"``.   This bug was introduced in pytest 8.0.0rc1.   - `#9765 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9765>`_, `#11816 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11816>`_: Fixed a frustrating bug that afflicted some users with the only error being``assert mod not in mods`. The issue was caused by the fact that`str(Path(mod))`and`mod.\_\_file\_\_`don't necessarily produce the same string, and was being erroneously used interchangeably in some places in the code.    This fix also broke the internal API of`PytestPluginManager.consider\_conftest``by introducing a new parameter -- we mention this in case it is being used by external code, even if marked as *private*.   pytest 8.0.0rc1 (2023-12-30) ============================  Breaking Changes ----------------  Old Deprecations Are Now Errors ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#7363 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7363>`_: **PytestRemovedIn8Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**    Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as   possible, all warnings of type``PytestRemovedIn8Warning`now generate errors   instead of warning messages by default.    **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 8.1**, so please consult the   [deprecations](#deprecations) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.    In the pytest`8.0.X`series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a   stopgap measure by adding this to your`pytest.ini`file:`\`ini \[pytest\] filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning

> But this will stop working when pytest `8.1` is released.

> **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to `7363`.

Version Compatibility `` ` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#11151 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11151>`_: Dropped support for Python 3.7, which `reached end-of-life on 2023-06-27 <https://devguide.python.org/versions/>`__.   - ``pluggy\>=1.3.0``is now required.   Collection Changes ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  In this version we've made several breaking changes to pytest's collection phase, particularly around how filesystem directories and Python packages are collected, fixing deficiencies and allowing for cleanups and improvements to pytest's internals. A deprecation period for these changes was not possible.   - `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Files and directories are now collected in alphabetical order jointly, unless changed by a plugin.   Previously, files were collected before directories.   See below for an example.   - `#8976 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8976>`_: Running `pytest pkg/__init__.py` now collects the `pkg/__init__.py` file (module) only.   Previously, it collected the entire `pkg` package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the `__init__.py` file itself   (unless :confval:`python_files` was changed to allow `__init__.py` file).    To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: `pytest pkg`.   - `#11137 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11137>`_: `pytest.Package` is no longer a `pytest.Module` or `pytest.File`.    The``Package``collector node designates a Python package, that is, a directory with an `__init__.py` file.   Previously``Package`was a subtype of`pytest.Module``(which represents a single Python module),   the module being the `__init__.py` file.   This has been deemed a design mistake (see :issue:`11137` and :issue:`7777` for details).    The``path`property of`Package`nodes now points to the package directory instead of the`\_\_init\_\_.py`file.    Note that a`Module`node for`\_\_init\_\_.py`(which is not a`Package``) may still exist,   if it is picked up during collection (e.g. if you configured :confval:`python_files` to include``\_\_init\_\_.py``files).   - `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Added a new `pytest.Directory` base collection node, which all collector nodes for filesystem directories are expected to subclass.   This is analogous to the existing `pytest.File` for file nodes.    Changed `pytest.Package` to be a subclass of `pytest.Directory`.   A``Package`represents a filesystem directory which is a Python package,   i.e. contains an`\_\_init\_\_.py``file.    `pytest.Package` now only collects files in its own directory; previously it collected recursively.   Sub-directories are collected as their own collector nodes, which then collect themselves, thus creating a collection tree which mirrors the filesystem hierarchy.    Added a new `pytest.Dir` concrete collection node, a subclass of `pytest.Directory`.   This node represents a filesystem directory, which is not a `pytest.Package`,   that is, does not contain an``\_\_init\_\_.py`file.   Similarly to`Package``, it only collects the files in its own directory.    `pytest.Session` now only collects the initial arguments, without recursing into directories.   This work is now done by the `recursive expansion process <pytest.Collector.collect>` of directory collector nodes.    `session.name <pytest.Session.name>` is now``""``; previously it was the rootdir directory name.   This matches `session.nodeid <_pytest.nodes.Node.nodeid>` which has always been `""`.    The collection tree now contains directories/packages up to the [rootdir <rootdir>](#rootdir-<rootdir>),   for initial arguments that are found within the rootdir.   For files outside the rootdir, only the immediate directory/package is collected --   note however that collecting from outside the rootdir is discouraged.    As an example, given the following filesystem tree::        myroot/           pytest.ini           top/           ├── aaa           │   └── test_aaa.py           ├── test_a.py           ├── test_b           │   ├── __init__.py           │   └── test_b.py           ├── test_c.py           └── zzz               ├── __init__.py               └── test_zzz.py    the collection tree, as shown by `pytest --collect-only top/` but with the otherwise-hidden `~pytest.Session` node added for clarity,   is now the following::        <Session>         <Dir myroot>           <Dir top>             <Dir aaa>               <Module test_aaa.py>                 <Function test_it>             <Module test_a.py>               <Function test_it>             <Package test_b>               <Module test_b.py>                 <Function test_it>             <Module test_c.py>               <Function test_it>             <Package zzz>               <Module test_zzz.py>                 <Function test_it>    Previously, it was::        <Session>         <Module top/test_a.py>           <Function test_it>         <Module top/test_c.py>           <Function test_it>         <Module top/aaa/test_aaa.py>           <Function test_it>         <Package test_b>           <Module test_b.py>             <Function test_it>         <Package zzz>           <Module test_zzz.py>             <Function test_it>    Code/plugins which rely on a specific shape of the collection tree might need to update.   - `#11676 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11676>`_: The classes `~_pytest.nodes.Node`, `~pytest.Collector`, `~pytest.Item`, `~pytest.File`, `~_pytest.nodes.FSCollector` are now marked abstract (see :mod:`abc`).    We do not expect this change to affect users and plugin authors, it will only cause errors when the code is already wrong or problematic.   Other breaking changes ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  These are breaking changes where deprecation was not possible.   - `#11282 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11282>`_: Sanitized the handling of the``default`parameter when defining configuration options.    Previously if`default``was not supplied for `parser.addini <pytest.Parser.addini>` and the configuration option value was not defined in a test session, then calls to `config.getini <pytest.Config.getini>` returned an *empty list* or an *empty string* depending on whether``type`was supplied or not respectively, which is clearly incorrect. Also,`None`was not honored even if`default=None``was used explicitly while defining the option.    Now the behavior of `parser.addini <pytest.Parser.addini>` is as follows:    * If``default`is NOT passed but`type`is provided, then a type-specific default will be returned. For example`type=bool`will return`False`,`type=str`will return`""`, etc.   * If`default=None`is passed and the option is not defined in a test session, then`None`will be returned, regardless of the`type`.   * If neither`default`nor`type`are provided, assume`type=str`and return`""``as default (this is as per previous behavior).    The team decided to not introduce a deprecation period for this change, as doing so would be complicated both in terms of communicating this to the community as well as implementing it, and also because the team believes this change should not break existing plugins except in rare cases.   - `#11667 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11667>`_: pytest's``setup.py`file is removed.   If you relied on this file, e.g. to install pytest using`setup.py install``,   please see `Why you shouldn't invoke setup.py directly <https://blog.ganssle.io/articles/2021/10/setup-py-deprecated.html#summary>`_ for alternatives.   - `#9288 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9288>`_: `~pytest.warns` now re-emits unmatched warnings when the context   closes -- previously it would consume all warnings, hiding those that were not   matched by the function.    While this is a new feature, we announce it as a breaking change   because many test suites are configured to error-out on warnings, and will   therefore fail on the newly-re-emitted warnings.   - The internal``FixtureManager.getfixtureclosure`method has changed. Plugins which use this method or   which subclass`FixtureManager``and overwrite that method will need to adapt to the change.    Deprecations ------------  - `#10465 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10465>`_: Test functions returning a value other than``None``will now issue a `pytest.PytestWarning` instead of``pytest.PytestRemovedIn8Warning``, meaning this will stay a warning instead of becoming an error in the future.   - `#3664 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3664>`_: Applying a mark to a fixture function now issues a warning: marks in fixtures never had any effect, but it is a common user error to apply a mark to a fixture (for example``usefixtures`) and expect it to work.    This will become an error in pytest 9.0.    Features and Improvements -------------------------  Improved Diffs ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  These changes improve the diffs that pytest prints when an assertion fails. Note that syntax highlighting requires the`pygments``package.   - `#11520 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11520>`_: The very verbose (``-vv``) diff output is now colored as a diff instead of a big chunk of red.    Python code in error reports is now syntax-highlighted as Python.    The sections in the error reports are now better separated.   - `#1531 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1531>`_: The very verbose diff (``-vv``) for every standard library container type is improved. The indentation is now consistent and the markers are on their own separate lines, which should reduce the diffs shown to users.    Previously, the standard Python pretty printer was used to generate the output, which puts opening and closing   markers on the same line as the first/last entry, in addition to not having consistent indentation.   - `#10617 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10617>`_: Added more comprehensive set assertion rewrites for comparisons other than equality``==`, with   the following operations now providing better failure messages:`\!=`,`\<=`,`\>=`,`\<`, and`\>``.   Separate Control For Assertion Verbosity ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#11387 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11387>`_: Added the new :confval:`verbosity_assertions` configuration option for fine-grained control of failed assertions verbosity.    If you've ever wished that pytest always show you full diffs, but without making everything else verbose, this is for you.    See [Fine-grained verbosity <pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>](#fine-grained-verbosity-<pytest.fine_grained_verbosity>) for more details.    For plugin authors, `config.get_verbosity <pytest.Config.get_verbosity>` can be used to retrieve the verbosity level for a specific verbosity type.   Additional Support For Exception Groups and``\_\_notes\_\_`` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  These changes improve pytest's support for exception groups.   - `#10441 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10441>`_: Added `ExceptionInfo.group_contains() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.group_contains>`, an assertion helper that tests if an `ExceptionGroup` contains a matching exception.    See [assert-matching-exception-groups](#assert-matching-exception-groups) for an example.   - `#11227 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11227>`_: Allow `pytest.raises` ``match`` argument to match against `PEP-678 <https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/>` ``\_\_notes\_\_``.   Custom Directory collectors ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#7777 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7777>`_: Added a new hook :hook:`pytest_collect_directory`,   which is called by filesystem-traversing collector nodes,   such as `pytest.Session`, `pytest.Dir` and `pytest.Package`,   to create a collector node for a sub-directory.   It is expected to return a subclass of `pytest.Directory`.   This hook allows plugins to [customize the collection of directories <custom directory collectors>](#customize-the-collection-of-directories-<custom-directory-collectors>).   "New-style" Hook Wrappers ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#11122 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11122>`_: pytest now uses "new-style" hook wrappers internally, available since pluggy 1.2.0.   See `pluggy's 1.2.0 changelog <https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/changelog.html#pluggy-1-2-0-2023-06-21>`_ and the [updated docs <hookwrapper>](#updated-docs-<hookwrapper>) for details.    Plugins which want to use new-style wrappers can do so if they require``pytest\>=8``.   Other Improvements ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  - `#11216 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11216>`_: If a test is skipped from inside an [xunit setup fixture <classic xunit>](#xunit-setup-fixture-<classic-xunit>), the test summary now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.   - `#11314 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11314>`_: Logging to a file using the``--log-file`option will use`--log-level`,`--log-format`and`--log-date-format`as fallback   if`--log-file-level`,`--log-file-format`and`--log-file-date-format``are not provided respectively.   - `#11610 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11610>`_: Added the `LogCaptureFixture.filtering() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.filtering>` context manager which   adds a given `logging.Filter` object to the :fixture:`caplog` fixture.   - `#11447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11447>`_: `pytest.deprecated_call` now also considers warnings of type `FutureWarning`.   - `#11600 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11600>`_: Improved the documentation and type signature for `pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail>`'s``condition`param to use`False``as the default value.   - `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: `~pytest.FixtureDef` is now exported as``pytest.FixtureDef``for typing purposes.   - `#11353 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11353>`_: Added typing to `~pytest.PytestPluginManager`.   Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10701 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10701>`_: `pytest.WarningsRecorder.pop` will return the most-closely-matched warning in the list,   rather than the first warning which is an instance of the requested type.   - `#11255 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11255>`_: Fixed crash on `parametrize(..., scope="package")` without a package present.   - `#11277 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11277>`_: Fixed a bug that when there are multiple fixtures for an indirect parameter,   the scope of the highest-scope fixture is picked for the parameter set, instead of that of the one with the narrowest scope.   - `#11456 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11456>`_: Parametrized tests now *really do* ensure that the ids given to each input are unique - for   example,``a, a, a0`now results in`a1, a2, a0`instead of the previous (buggy)`a0, a1, a0``.   This necessarily means changing nodeids where these were previously colliding, and for   readability adds an underscore when non-unique ids end in a number.   - `#11563 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11563>`_: Fixed a crash when using an empty string for the same parametrized value more than once.   - `#11712 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11712>`_: Fixed handling``NO\_COLOR`and`FORCE\_COLOR``to ignore an empty value.   - `#9036 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9036>`_:``pytest.warns`and similar functions now capture warnings when an exception is raised inside a`with``block.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#11011 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11011>`_: Added a warning about modifying the root logger during tests when using``caplog``.   - `#11065 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11065>`_: Use``pytestconfig`instead of`request.config``in cache example to be consistent with the API documentation.   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#11208 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11208>`_: The (internal)``FixtureDef.cached\_result`type has changed.   Now the third item`cached\_result\[2\]``, when set, is an exception instance instead of an exception triplet.   - `#11218 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11218>`_: (This entry is meant to assist plugins which access private pytest internals to instantiate``FixtureRequest``objects.)    `~pytest.FixtureRequest` is now an abstract class which can't be instantiated directly.   A new concrete``TopRequest`subclass of`FixtureRequest`has been added for the`request`fixture in test functions,   as counterpart to the existing`SubRequest`subclass for the`request``fixture in fixture functions.   - `#11315 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11315>`_: The :fixture:`pytester` fixture now uses the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture to manage the current working directory.   If you use``pytester``in combination with `monkeypatch.undo() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.undo>`, the CWD might get restored.   Use `monkeypatch.context() <pytest.MonkeyPatch.context>` instead.   - `#11333 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11333>`_: Corrected the spelling of``Config.ArgsSource.INVOCATION\_DIR`.   The previous spelling`INCOVATION\_DIR``remains as an alias.   - `#11638 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11638>`_: Fixed the selftests to pass correctly if``FORCE\_COLOR`,`NO\_COLOR`or`PY\_COLORS``is set in the calling environment.  pytest 7.4.4 (2023-12-31) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#11140 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11140>`_: Fix non-string constants at the top of file being detected as docstrings on Python>=3.8.   - `#11572 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11572>`_: Handle an edge case where `sys.stderr` and `sys.__stderr__` might already be closed when [faulthandler](#faulthandler) is tearing down.   - `#11710 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11710>`_: Fixed tracebacks from collection errors not getting pruned.   - `#7966 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7966>`_: Removed unhelpful error message from assertion rewrite mechanism when exceptions are raised in``\_\_iter\_\_``methods. Now they are treated un-iterable instead.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#11091 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11091>`_: Updated documentation to refer to hyphenated options: replaced``--junitxml`with`--junit-xml`and`--collectonly`with`--collect-only``.   pytest 7.4.3 (2023-10-24) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10447>`_: Markers are now considered in the reverse mro order to ensure base  class markers are considered first -- this resolves a regression.   - `#11239 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11239>`_: Fixed``:=``in asserts impacting unrelated test cases.   - `#11439 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11439>`_: Handled an edge case where `sys.stderr` might already be closed when [faulthandler](#faulthandler) is tearing down.   pytest 7.4.2 (2023-09-07) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#11237 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11237>`_: Fix doctest collection of `functools.cached_property` objects.   - `#11306 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11306>`_: Fixed bug using``--importmode=importlib`which would cause package`\_\_init\_\_.py``files to be imported more than once in some cases.   - `#11367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11367>`_: Fixed bug where `user_properties` where not being saved in the JUnit XML file if a fixture failed during teardown.   - `#11394 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11394>`_: Fixed crash when parsing long command line arguments that might be interpreted as files.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#11391 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11391>`_: Improved disclaimer on pytest plugin reference page to better indicate this is an automated, non-curated listing.   pytest 7.4.1 (2023-09-02) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10337>`_: Fixed bug where fake intermediate modules generated by``--import-mode=importlib``would not include the   child modules as attributes of the parent modules.   - `#10702 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10702>`_: Fixed error assertion handling in `pytest.approx` when``None``is an expected or received value when comparing dictionaries.   - `#10811 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10811>`_: Fixed issue when using``--import-mode=importlib`together with`--doctest-modules``that caused modules   to be imported more than once, causing problems with modules that have import side effects.   pytest 7.4.0 (2023-06-23) =========================  Features --------  - `#10901 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10901>`_: Added `ExceptionInfo.from_exception() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exception>`, a simpler way to create an `~pytest.ExceptionInfo` from an exception.   This can replace `ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info() <pytest.ExceptionInfo.from_exc_info()>` for most uses.    Improvements ------------  - `#10872 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10872>`_: Update test log report annotation to named tuple and fixed inconsistency in docs for :hook:`pytest_report_teststatus` hook.   - `#10907 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10907>`_: When an exception traceback to be displayed is completely filtered out (by mechanisms such as``\_\_tracebackhide\_\_``, internal frames, and similar), now only the exception string and the following message are shown:    "All traceback entries are hidden. Pass `--full-trace` to see hidden and internal frames.".    Previously, the last frame of the traceback was shown, even though it was hidden.   - `#10940 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10940>`_: Improved verbose output (``-vv`) of`skip`and`xfail`reasons by performing text wrapping while leaving a clear margin for progress output.    Added`TerminalReporter.wrap\_write()``as a helper for that.   - `#10991 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10991>`_: Added handling of``%f`directive to print microseconds in log format options, such as`log-date-format``.   - `#11005 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11005>`_: Added the underlying exception to the cache provider's path creation and write warning messages.   - `#11013 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11013>`_: Added warning when :confval:`testpaths` is set, but paths are not found by glob. In this case, pytest will fall back to searching from the current directory.   - `#11043 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11043>`_: When `--confcutdir` is not specified, and there is no config file present, the conftest cutoff directory (`--confcutdir`) is now set to the [rootdir <rootdir>](#rootdir-<rootdir>).   Previously in such cases, `conftest.py` files would be probed all the way to the root directory of the filesystem.   If you are badly affected by this change, consider adding an empty config file to your desired cutoff directory, or explicitly set `--confcutdir`.   - `#11081 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11081>`_: The :confval:`norecursedirs` check is now performed in a :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` implementation, so plugins can affect it.    If after updating to this version you see that your `norecursedirs` setting is not being respected,   it means that a conftest or a plugin you use has a bad `pytest_ignore_collect` implementation.   Most likely, your hook returns `False` for paths it does not want to ignore,   which ends the processing and doesn't allow other plugins, including pytest itself, to ignore the path.   The fix is to return `None` instead of `False` for paths your hook doesn't want to ignore.   - `#8711 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8711>`_: `caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` and `caplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>`   will temporarily enable the requested``level`if`level`was disabled globally via`logging.disable(LEVEL)``.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10831 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10831>`_: Terminal Reporting: Fixed bug when running in``--tb=line`mode where`pytest.fail(pytrace=False)`tests report`None``.   - `#11068 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11068>`_: Fixed the``--last-failed``whole-file skipping functionality ("skipped N files") for [non-python test files <non-python tests>](#non-python-test-files-<non-python-tests>).   - `#11104 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11104>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.3.2 which caused to :confval:`testpaths` to be considered for loading initial conftests,   even when it was not utilized (e.g. when explicit paths were given on the command line).   Now the``testpaths``are only considered when they are in use.   - `#1904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904>`_: Fixed traceback entries hidden with``\_\_tracebackhide\_\_ = True``still being shown for chained exceptions (parts after "... the above exception ..." message).   - `#7781 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7781>`_: Fix writing non-encodable text to log file when using``--debug``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#9146 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9146>`_: Improved documentation for `caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>`.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#11031 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11031>`_: Enhanced the CLI flag for``-c`to now include`--config-file``to make it clear that this flag applies to the usage of a custom config file.   pytest 7.3.2 (2023-06-10) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10169 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10169>`_: Fix bug where very long option names could cause pytest to break with``OSError: \[Errno 36\] File name too long``on some systems.   - `#10894 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10894>`_: Support for Python 3.12 (beta at the time of writing).   - `#10987 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10987>`_: :confval:`testpaths` is now honored to load root``conftests``.   - `#10999 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10999>`_: The `monkeypatch` `setitem`/`delitem` type annotations now allow `TypedDict` arguments.   - `#11028 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11028>`_: Fixed bug in assertion rewriting where a variable assigned with the walrus operator could not be used later in a function call.   - `#11054 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/11054>`_: Fixed``--last-failed``'s "(skipped N files)" functionality for files inside of packages (directories with `__init__.py` files).   pytest 7.3.1 (2023-04-14) =========================  Improvements ------------  - `#10875 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10875>`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed``RuntimeError: TestResult has no addDuration method`when running`unittest``tests.   - `#10890 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10890>`_: Python 3.12 support: fixed``shutil.rmtree(onerror=...)``deprecation warning when using :fixture:`tmp_path`.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10896 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10896>`_: Fixed performance regression related to :fixture:`tmp_path` and the new :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` option.   - `#10903 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10903>`_: Fix crash``INTERNALERROR IndexError: list index out of range`which happens when displaying an exception where all entries are hidden.   This reverts the change "Correctly handle`\_\_tracebackhide\_\_``for chained exceptions." introduced in version 7.3.0.   pytest 7.3.0 (2023-04-08) =========================  Features --------  - `#10525 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10525>`_: Test methods decorated with``@classmethod``can now be discovered as tests, following the same rules as normal methods. This fills the gap that static methods were discoverable as tests but not class methods.   - `#10755 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10755>`_: :confval:`console_output_style` now supports``progress-even-when-capture-no``to force the use of the progress output even when capture is disabled. This is useful in large test suites where capture may have significant performance impact.   - `#7431 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7431>`_:``--log-disable``CLI option added to disable individual loggers.   - `#8141 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8141>`_: Added :confval:`tmp_path_retention_count` and :confval:`tmp_path_retention_policy` configuration options to control how directories created by the :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture are kept.    Improvements ------------  - `#10226 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10226>`_: If multiple errors are raised in teardown, we now re-raise an``ExceptionGroup``of them instead of discarding all but the last.   - `#10658 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10658>`_: Allow``-p`arguments to include spaces (eg:`-p no:logging`instead of`-pno:logging`). Mostly useful in the`addopts``section of the configuration   file.   - `#10710 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10710>`_: Added``start`and`stop`timestamps to`TestReport``objects.   - `#10727 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10727>`_: Split the report header for``rootdir`,`config file`and`testpaths``so each has its own line.   - `#10840 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10840>`_: pytest should no longer crash on AST with pathological position attributes, for example testing AST produced by `Hylang <https://github.com/hylang/hy>__`.   - `#6267 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/6267>`_: The full output of a test is no longer truncated if the truncation message would be longer than   the hidden text. The line number shown has also been fixed.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10743 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10743>`_: The assertion rewriting mechanism now works correctly when assertion expressions contain the walrus operator.   - `#10765 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10765>`_: Fixed :fixture:`tmp_path` fixture always raising `OSError` on``emscripten``platform due to missing `os.getuid`.   - `#1904 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/1904>`_: Correctly handle``\_\_tracebackhide\_\_``for chained exceptions.   NOTE: This change was reverted in version 7.3.1.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#10782 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10782>`_: Fixed the minimal example in [goodpractices](#goodpractices):``pip install -e .`requires a`version`entry in`pyproject.toml``to run successfully.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#10669 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10669>`_: pytest no longer directly depends on the `attrs <https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/>`__ package. While   we at pytest all love the package dearly and would like to thank the``attrs`team for many years of cooperation and support,   it makes sense for`pytest`to have as little external dependencies as possible, as this helps downstream projects.   With that in mind, we have replaced the pytest's limited internal usage to use the standard library's`dataclasses`instead.    Nice diffs for`attrs``classes are still supported though.   pytest 7.2.2 (2023-03-03) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10533 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10533>`_: Fixed `pytest.approx` handling of dictionaries containing one or more values of `0.0`.   - `#10592 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10592>`_: Fixed crash if `--cache-show` and `--help` are passed at the same time.   - `#10597 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10597>`_: Fixed bug where a fixture method named``teardown`would be called as part of`nose``teardown stage.   - `#10626 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10626>`_: Fixed crash if``--fixtures`and`--help``are passed at the same time.   - `#10660 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10660>`_: Fixed :py`pytest.raises` to return a 'ContextManager' so that type-checkers could narrow   :code:`pytest.raises(...) if ... else nullcontext()` down to 'ContextManager' rather than 'object'.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#10690 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10690>`_: Added `CI` and `BUILD_NUMBER` environment variables to the documentation.   - `#10721 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10721>`_: Fixed entry-points declaration in the documentation example using Hatch.   - `#10753 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10753>`_: Changed wording of the module level skip to be very explicit   about not collecting tests and not executing the rest of the module.   pytest 7.2.1 (2023-01-13) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10452 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10452>`_: Fix 'importlib.abc.TraversableResources' deprecation warning in Python 3.12.   - `#10457 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10457>`_: If a test is skipped from inside a fixture, the test summary now shows the test location instead of the fixture location.   - `#10506 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10506>`_: Fix bug where sometimes pytest would use the file system root directory as [rootdir <rootdir>](#rootdir-<rootdir>) on Windows.   - `#10607 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10607>`_: Fix a race condition when creating junitxml reports, which could occur when multiple instances of pytest execute in parallel.   - `#10641 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10641>`_: Fix a race condition when creating or updating the stepwise plugin's cache, which could occur when multiple xdist worker nodes try to simultaneously update the stepwise plugin's cache.   pytest 7.2.0 (2022-10-23) =========================  Deprecations ------------  - `#10012 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10012>`_: Update``pytest.PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning``to a deprecation; it will raise an error in pytest 8.   - `#10396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10396>`_: pytest no longer depends on the``py`library.`pytest`provides a vendored copy of`py.error`and`py.path`modules but will use the`py`library if it is installed.  If you need other`py.\*`modules, continue to install the deprecated`py``library separately, otherwise it can usually be removed as a dependency.   - `#4562 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4562>`_: Deprecate configuring hook specs/impls using attributes/marks.    Instead use :py`pytest.hookimpl` and :py`pytest.hookspec`.   For more details, see the [docs <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>](#docs-<legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>).   - `#9886 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9886>`_: The functionality for running tests written for``nose`has been officially deprecated.    This includes:    * Plain`setup`and`teardown`functions and methods: this might catch users by surprise, as`setup()`and`teardown()`are not pytest idioms, but part of the`nose``support.   * Setup/teardown using the `@with_setup <with-setup-nose>`_ decorator.    For more details, consult the [deprecation docs <nose-deprecation>](#deprecation-docs-<nose-deprecation>).    .. _`with-setup-nose`: https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/testing_tools.html?highlight=with_setup#nose.tools.with_setup  - `#7337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7337>`_: A deprecation warning is now emitted if a test function returns something other than `None`. This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a `bool` (for example `return foo(a, b) == result`) would cause a test to pass or fail, instead of using `assert`. The plan is to make returning non-`None` from tests an error in the future.   Features --------  - `#9897 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9897>`_: Added shell-style wildcard support to``testpaths``.    Improvements ------------  - `#10218 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10218>`_:``@pytest.mark.parametrize()`(and similar functions) now accepts any`Sequence\[str\]`for the argument names,   instead of just`list\[str\]`and`tuple\[str, ...\]`.    (Note that`str`, which is itself a`Sequence\[str\]``, is still treated as a   comma-delimited name list, as before).   - `#10381 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10381>`_: The``--no-showlocals`flag has been added. This can be passed directly to tests to override`--showlocals`declared through`addopts``.   - `#3426 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3426>`_: Assertion failures with strings in NFC and NFD forms that normalize to the same string now have a dedicated error message detailing the issue, and their utf-8 representation is expressed instead.   - `#8508 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8508>`_: Introduce multiline display for warning matching  via :py`pytest.warns` and   enhance match comparison for :py`pytest.ExceptionInfo.match` as returned by :py`pytest.raises`.   - `#8646 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8646>`_: Improve :py`pytest.raises`. Previously passing an empty tuple would give a confusing   error. We now raise immediately with a more helpful message.   - `#9741 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9741>`_: On Python 3.11, use the standard library's :mod:`tomllib` to parse TOML.    `tomli` is no longer a dependency on Python 3.11.   - `#9742 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9742>`_: Display assertion message without escaped newline characters with``-vv``.   - `#9823 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9823>`_: Improved error message that is shown when no collector is found for a given file.   - `#9873 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9873>`_: Some coloring has been added to the short test summary.   - `#9883 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9883>`_: Normalize the help description of all command-line options.   - `#9920 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9920>`_: Display full crash messages in``short test summary info``, when running in a CI environment.   - `#9987 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9987>`_: Added support for hidden configuration file by allowing``.pytest.ini`as an alternative to`pytest.ini``.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10150 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10150>`_: `sys.stdin` now contains all expected methods of a file-like object when capture is enabled.   - `#10382 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10382>`_: Do not break into pdb when``raise unittest.SkipTest()``appears top-level in a file.   - `#7792 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7792>`_: Marks are now inherited according to the full MRO in test classes. Previously, if a test class inherited from two or more classes, only marks from the first super-class would apply.    When inheriting marks from super-classes, marks from the sub-classes are now ordered before marks from the super-classes, in MRO order. Previously it was the reverse.    When inheriting marks from super-classes, the `pytestmark` attribute of the sub-class now only contains the marks directly applied to it. Previously, it also contained marks from its super-classes. Please note that this attribute should not normally be accessed directly; use `Node.iter_markers <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers>` instead.   - `#9159 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9159>`_: Showing inner exceptions by forcing native display in``ExceptionGroups`even when using display options other than`--tb=native`. A temporary step before full implementation of pytest-native display for inner exceptions in`ExceptionGroups``.   - `#9877 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9877>`_: Ensure``caplog.get\_records(when)`returns current/correct data after invoking`caplog.clear()``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#10344 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10344>`_: Update information on writing plugins to use``pyproject.toml`instead of`setup.py``.   - `#9248 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9248>`_: The documentation is now built using Sphinx 5.x (up from 3.x previously).   - `#9291 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9291>`_: Update documentation on how `pytest.warns` affects `DeprecationWarning`.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#10313 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10313>`_: Made``\_pytest.doctest.DoctestItem`export`pytest.DoctestItem``for   type check and runtime purposes. Made `_pytest.doctest` use internal APIs   to avoid circular imports.   - `#9906 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9906>`_: Made``\_pytest.compat`re-export`importlib\_metadata``in the eyes of type checkers.   - `#9910 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9910>`_: Fix default encoding warning (``EncodingWarning`) in`cacheprovider``- `#9984 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9984>`_: Improve the error message when we attempt to access a fixture that has been   torn down.   Add an additional sentence to the docstring explaining when it's not a good   idea to call``getfixturevalue``.   pytest 7.1.3 (2022-08-31) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#10060 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10060>`_: When running with``--pdb`,`TestCase.tearDown`is no longer called for tests when the *class* has been skipped via`unittest.skip`or`pytest.mark.skip``.   - `#10190 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10190>`_: Invalid XML characters in setup or teardown error messages are now properly escaped for JUnit XML reports.   - `#10230 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10230>`_: Ignore``.py`files created by`pyproject.toml``-based editable builds introduced in `pip 21.3 <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/news/#v21-3>`__.   - `#3396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/3396>`_: Doctests now respect the``--import-mode``flag.   - `#9514 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9514>`_: Type-annotate``FixtureRequest.param`as`Any``as a stop gap measure until :issue:`8073` is fixed.   - `#9791 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9791>`_: Fixed a path handling code in``rewrite.py``that seems to work fine, but was incorrect and fails in some systems.   - `#9917 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9917>`_: Fixed string representation for `pytest.approx` when used to compare tuples.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#9937 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9937>`_: Explicit note that :fixture:`tmpdir` fixture is discouraged in favour of :fixture:`tmp_path`.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#10114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/10114>`_: Replace `atomicwrites <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`__ dependency on windows with `os.replace`.   pytest 7.1.2 (2022-04-23) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#9726 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9726>`_: An unnecessary``numpy``import inside `pytest.approx` was removed.   - `#9820 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9820>`_: Fix comparison of``dataclasses`with`InitVar``.   - `#9869 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9869>`_: Increase``stacklevel`for the`NODE\_CTOR\_FSPATH\_ARG``deprecation to point to the   user's code, not pytest.   - `#9871 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9871>`_: Fix a bizarre (and fortunately rare) bug where the `temp_path` fixture could raise   an internal error while attempting to get the current user's username.   pytest 7.1.1 (2022-03-17) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#9767 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9767>`_: Fixed a regression in pytest 7.1.0 where some conftest.py files outside of the source tree (e.g. in the `site-packages` directory) were not picked up.   pytest 7.1.0 (2022-03-13) =========================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - `#8838 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8838>`_: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 6.X series and are now   removed:    *``pytest.\_fillfuncargs`function.    *`pytest\_warning\_captured`hook - use`pytest\_warning\_recorded`instead.    *`-k -foobar`syntax - use`-k 'not foobar'`instead.    *`-k foobar:`syntax.    *`pytest.collect`module - import from`pytest``directly.    For more information consult   `Deprecations and Removals <https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/deprecations.html>`__ in the docs.   - `#9437 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9437>`_: Dropped support for Python 3.6, which reached `end-of-life <https://devguide.python.org/#status-of-python-branches>`__ at 2021-12-23.    Improvements ------------  - `#5192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5192>`_: Fixed test output for some data types where``-v`would show less information.    Also, when showing diffs for sequences,`-q``would produce full diffs instead of the expected diff.   - `#9362 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9362>`_: pytest now avoids specialized assert formatting when it is detected that the default``\_\_eq\_\_`is overridden in`attrs`or`dataclasses``.   - `#9536 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9536>`_: When``-vv``is given on command line, show skipping and xfail reasons in full instead of truncating them to fit the terminal width.   - `#9644 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9644>`_: More information about the location of resources that led Python to raise `ResourceWarning` can now   be obtained by enabling :mod:`tracemalloc`.    See [resource-warnings](#resource-warnings) for more information.   - `#9678 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9678>`_: More types are now accepted in the``ids`argument to`@pytest.mark.parametrize``.   Previously only `str`, `float`, `int` and `bool` were accepted;   now `bytes`, `complex`, `re.Pattern`, `Enum` and anything with a `__name__` are also accepted.   - `#9692 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9692>`_: `pytest.approx` now raises a `TypeError` when given an unordered sequence (such as `set`).    Note that this implies that custom classes which only implement``\_\_iter\_\_`and`\_\_len\_\_``are no longer supported as they don't guarantee order.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#8242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8242>`_: The deprecation of raising `unittest.SkipTest` to skip collection of   tests during the pytest collection phase is reverted - this is now a supported   feature again.   - `#9493 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9493>`_: Symbolic link components are no longer resolved in conftest paths.   This means that if a conftest appears twice in collection tree, using symlinks, it will be executed twice.   For example, given        tests/real/conftest.py       tests/real/test_it.py       tests/link -> tests/real    running``pytest tests`now imports the conftest twice, once as`tests/real/conftest.py`and once as`tests/link/conftest.py``.   This is a fix to match a similar change made to test collection itself in pytest 6.0 (see :pr:`6523` for details).   - `#9626 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9626>`_: Fixed count of selected tests on terminal collection summary when there were errors or skipped modules.    If there were errors or skipped modules on collection, pytest would mistakenly subtract those from the selected count.   - `#9645 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9645>`_: Fixed regression where``--import-mode=importlib``used together with :envvar:`PYTHONPATH` or :confval:`pythonpath` would cause import errors in test suites.   - `#9708 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9708>`_: :fixture:`pytester` now requests a :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture instead of creating one internally. This solves some issues with tests that involve pytest environment variables.   - `#9730 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9730>`_: Malformed``pyproject.toml``files now produce a clearer error message.   pytest 7.0.1 (2022-02-11) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - `#9608 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9608>`_: Fix invalid importing of``importlib.readers``in Python 3.9.   - `#9610 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9610>`_: Restore `UnitTestFunction.obj` to return unbound rather than bound method.   Fixes a crash during a failed teardown in unittest TestCases with non-default `__init__`.   Regressed in pytest 7.0.0.   - `#9636 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9636>`_: The``pythonpath`plugin was renamed to`python\_path`. This avoids a conflict with the`pytest-pythonpath``plugin.   - `#9642 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9642>`_: Fix running tests by id with``::``in the parametrize portion.   - `#9643 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9643>`_: Delay issuing a `~pytest.PytestWarning` about diamond inheritance involving `~pytest.Item` and   `~pytest.Collector` so it can be filtered using [standard warning filters <warnings>](#standard-warning-filters-<warnings>).   pytest 7.0.0 (2022-02-03) =========================  (**Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 7.0.0rc1 notes below**)  Deprecations ------------  - `#9488 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9488>`_: If custom subclasses of nodes like `pytest.Item` override the``\_\_init\_\_`method, they should take`\*\*kwargs``. See   [uncooperative-constructors-deprecated](#uncooperative-constructors-deprecated) for details.    Note that a deprecation warning is only emitted when there is a conflict in the   arguments pytest expected to pass. This deprecation was already part of pytest   7.0.0rc1 but wasn't documented.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#9355 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9355>`_: Fixed error message prints function decorators when using assert in Python 3.8 and above.   - `#9396 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9396>`_: Ensure `pytest.Config.inifile` is available during the :hook:`pytest_cmdline_main` hook (regression during``7.0.0rc1``).    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#9404 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9404>`_: Added extra documentation on alternatives to common misuses of `pytest.warns(None)` ahead of its deprecation.   - `#9505 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9505>`_: Clarify where the configuration files are located. To avoid confusions documentation mentions   that configuration file is located in the root of the repository.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#9521 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9521>`_: Add test coverage to assertion rewrite path.   pytest 7.0.0rc1 (2021-12-06) ============================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: The [Node.reportinfo() <non-python tests>](#node.reportinfo()-<non-python-tests>) function first return value type has been expanded from `py.path.local | str` to `os.PathLike[str] | str`.    Most plugins which refer to `reportinfo()` only define it as part of a custom `pytest.Item` implementation.   Since `py.path.local` is an `os.PathLike[str]`, these plugins are unaffected.    Plugins and users which call `reportinfo()`, use the first return value and interact with it as a `py.path.local`, would need to adjust by calling `py.path.local(fspath)`.   Although preferably, avoid the legacy `py.path.local` and use `pathlib.Path`, or use `item.location` or `item.path`, instead.    Note: pytest was not able to provide a deprecation period for this change.   - `#8246 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8246>`_:``--version`now writes version information to`stdout`rather than`stderr``.   - `#8733 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8733>`_: Drop a workaround for `pyreadline <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline>`__ that made it work with``--pdb``.    The workaround was introduced in `#1281 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pull/1281>`__ in 2015, however since then   `pyreadline seems to have gone unmaintained <https://github.com/pyreadline/pyreadline/issues/58>`__, is `generating   warnings <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8847>`__, and will stop working on Python 3.10.   - `#9061 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9061>`_: Using `pytest.approx` in a boolean context now raises an error hinting at the proper usage.    It is apparently common for users to mistakenly use``pytest.approx`like this:`\`python assert pytest.approx(actual, expected)

> While the correct usage is:
> 
> ``` python
> assert actual == pytest.approx(expected)
> ```
> 
> The new error message helps catch those mistakes.

  - [\#9277](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9277): The `pytest.Instance` collector type has been removed. Importing `pytest.Instance` or `_pytest.python.Instance` returns a dummy type and emits a deprecation warning. See \[instance-collector-deprecation\](\#instance-collector-deprecation) for details.

  - [\#9308](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9308): **PytestRemovedIn7Warning deprecation warnings are now errors by default.**
    
    Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as possible, all warnings of type `PytestRemovedIn7Warning` now generate errors instead of warning messages by default.
    
    **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 7.1**, so please consult the \[deprecations\](\#deprecations) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.
    
    In the pytest `7.0.X` series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stopgap measure by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
    
    ``` ini
    [pytest]
    filterwarnings =
        ignore::pytest.PytestRemovedIn7Warning
    ```
    
    But this will stop working when pytest `7.1` is released.
    
    **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to `9308`.

Deprecations `` ` ------------  - `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: ``py.path.local`arguments for hooks have been deprecated. See [the deprecation note <legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>](#the-deprecation-note-<legacy-path-hooks-deprecated>) for full details.`py.path.local``arguments to Node constructors have been deprecated. See [the deprecation note <node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>](#the-deprecation-note-<node-ctor-fspath-deprecation>) for full details.    .. note::       The name of the `~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the       new attribute being``path`) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks       (the old argument being`path``).        This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be       resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`       dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).   - `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: Directly constructing the following classes is now deprecated:    -``\_pytest.mark.structures.Mark`-`\_pytest.mark.structures.MarkDecorator`-`\_pytest.mark.structures.MarkGenerator`-`\_pytest.python.Metafunc`-`\_pytest.runner.CallInfo`-`\_pytest.\_code.ExceptionInfo`-`\_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser`-`\_pytest.config.argparsing.OptionGroup`-`\_pytest.pytester.HookRecorder``These constructors have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.   - `#8242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8242>`_: Raising `unittest.SkipTest` to skip collection of tests during the   pytest collection phase is deprecated. Use `pytest.skip` instead.    Note: This deprecation only relates to using `unittest.SkipTest` during test   collection. You are probably not doing that. Ordinary usage of   `unittest.SkipTest` / `unittest.TestCase.skipTest` /   `unittest.skip` in unittest test cases is fully supported.    .. note:: This deprecation has been reverted in pytest 7.1.0.   - `#8315 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8315>`_: Several behaviors of `Parser.addoption <pytest.Parser.addoption>` are now   scheduled for removal in pytest 8 (deprecated since pytest 2.4.0):    -``parser.addoption(..., help=".. %default ..")`- use`%(default)s`instead.   -`parser.addoption(..., type="int/string/float/complex")`- use`type=int``etc. instead.   - `#8447 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8447>`_: Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an `~pytest.Item` and a `~pytest.Collector` (e.g. `~pytest.File`) now issues a warning.   It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.    See [the deprecation note <diamond-inheritance-deprecated>](#the-deprecation-note-<diamond-inheritance-deprecated>) for full details.   - `#8592 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8592>`_:``pytest\_cmdline\_preparse``has been officially deprecated.  It will be removed in a future release.  Use :hook:`pytest_load_initial_conftests` instead.    See [the deprecation note <cmdline-preparse-deprecated>](#the-deprecation-note-<cmdline-preparse-deprecated>) for full details.   - `#8645 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8645>`_: `pytest.warns(None) <pytest.warns>` is now deprecated because many people used   it to mean "this code does not emit warnings", but it actually had the effect of   checking that the code emits at least one warning of any type - like``pytest.warns()`or`pytest.warns(Warning)``.   - `#8948 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8948>`_: `pytest.skip(msg=...) <pytest.skip>`, `pytest.fail(msg=...) <pytest.fail>` and `pytest.exit(msg=...) <pytest.exit>`   signatures now accept a``reason`argument instead of`msg`.  Using`msg``still works, but is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.    This was changed for consistency with `pytest.mark.skip <pytest.mark.skip>` and  `pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail>` which both accept``reason``as an argument.  - `#8174 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8174>`_: The following changes have been made to types reachable through `pytest.ExceptionInfo.traceback`:    - The``path`property of`\_pytest.code.Code`returns`Path`instead of`py.path.local`.   - The`path`property of`\_pytest.code.TracebackEntry`returns`Path`instead of`py.path.local``.    There was no deprecation period for this change (sorry!).   Features --------  - `#5196 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5196>`_: Tests are now ordered by definition order in more cases.    In a class hierarchy, tests from base classes are now consistently ordered before tests defined on their subclasses (reverse MRO order).   - `#7132 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7132>`_: Added two environment variables :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME` and :envvar:`PYTEST_THEME_MODE` to let the users customize the pygments theme used.   - `#7259 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7259>`_: Added `cache.mkdir() <pytest.Cache.mkdir>`, which is similar to the existing``cache.makedir()``,   but returns a `pathlib.Path` instead of a legacy``py.path.local`.    Added a`paths``type to `parser.addini() <pytest.Parser.addini>`,   as in``parser.addini("mypaths", "my paths", type="paths")`,   which is similar to the existing`pathlist``,   but returns a list of `pathlib.Path` instead of legacy``py.path.local``.   - `#7469 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7469>`_: The types of objects used in pytest's API are now exported so they may be used in type annotations.    The newly-exported types are:    -``pytest.Config``for `Config <pytest.Config>`.   -``pytest.Mark``for `marks <pytest.Mark>`.   -``pytest.MarkDecorator``for `mark decorators <pytest.MarkDecorator>`.   -``pytest.MarkGenerator``for the `pytest.mark <pytest.MarkGenerator>` singleton.   -``pytest.Metafunc``for the `metafunc <pytest.MarkGenerator>` argument to the :hook:`pytest_generate_tests` hook.   -``pytest.CallInfo``for the `CallInfo <pytest.CallInfo>` type passed to various hooks.   -``pytest.PytestPluginManager``for `PytestPluginManager <pytest.PytestPluginManager>`.   -``pytest.ExceptionInfo``for the `ExceptionInfo <pytest.ExceptionInfo>` type returned from `pytest.raises` and passed to various hooks.   -``pytest.Parser``for the `Parser <pytest.Parser>` type passed to the :hook:`pytest_addoption` hook.   -``pytest.OptionGroup``for the `OptionGroup <pytest.OptionGroup>` type returned from the `parser.addgroup <pytest.Parser.getgroup>` method.   -``pytest.HookRecorder``for the `HookRecorder <pytest.HookRecorder>` type returned from `~pytest.Pytester`.   -``pytest.RecordedHookCall``for the `RecordedHookCall <pytest.HookRecorder>` type returned from `~pytest.HookRecorder`.   -``pytest.RunResult``for the `RunResult <pytest.RunResult>` type returned from `~pytest.Pytester`.   -``pytest.LineMatcher``for the `LineMatcher <pytest.LineMatcher>` type used in `~pytest.RunResult` and others.   -``pytest.TestReport``for the `TestReport <pytest.TestReport>` type used in various hooks.   -``pytest.CollectReport``for the `CollectReport <pytest.CollectReport>` type used in various hooks.    Constructing most of them directly is not supported; they are only meant for use in type annotations.   Doing so will emit a deprecation warning, and may become a hard-error in pytest 8.0.    Subclassing them is also not supported. This is not currently enforced at runtime, but is detected by type-checkers such as mypy.   - `#7856 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7856>`_: [--import-mode=importlib <import-modes>](#--import-mode=importlib-<import-modes>) now works with features that   depend on modules being on :py`sys.modules`, such as :mod:`pickle` and :mod:`dataclasses`.   - `#8144 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8144>`_: The following hooks now receive an additional``pathlib.Path`argument, equivalent to an existing`py.path.local``argument:    - :hook:`pytest_ignore_collect` - The``collection\_path`parameter (equivalent to existing`path``parameter).   - :hook:`pytest_collect_file` - The``file\_path`parameter (equivalent to existing`path``parameter).   - :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makemodule` - The``module\_path`parameter (equivalent to existing`path``parameter).   - :hook:`pytest_report_header` - The``start\_path`parameter (equivalent to existing`startdir``parameter).   - :hook:`pytest_report_collectionfinish` - The``start\_path`parameter (equivalent to existing`startdir``parameter).    .. note::       The name of the `~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the       new attribute being``path`) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks       (the old argument being`path``).        This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be       resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`       dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).   - `#8251 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8251>`_: Implement``Node.path`as a`pathlib.Path`. Both the old`fspath`and this new attribute gets set no matter whether`path`or`fspath`(deprecated) is passed to the constructor. It is a replacement for the`fspath`attribute (which represents the same path as`py.path.local`). While`fspath``is not deprecated yet   due to the ongoing migration of methods like `~pytest.Item.reportinfo`, we expect to deprecate it in a future release.    .. note::       The name of the `~_pytest.nodes.Node` arguments and attributes (the       new attribute being``path`) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks       (the old argument being`path``).        This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be       resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the :pypi:`py`       dependency (see :issue:`9283` for a longer discussion).   - `#8421 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8421>`_: `pytest.approx` now works on `~decimal.Decimal` within mappings/dicts and sequences/lists.   - `#8606 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8606>`_: pytest invocations with``--fixtures-per-test`and`--fixtures`have been enriched with:    - Fixture location path printed with the fixture name.   - First section of the fixture's docstring printed under the fixture name.   - Whole of fixture's docstring printed under the fixture name using`--verbose``option.   - `#8761 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8761>`_: New [version-tuple](#version-tuple) attribute, which makes it simpler for users to do something depending on the pytest version (such as declaring hooks which are introduced in later versions).   - `#8789 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8789>`_: Switch TOML parser from``toml`to`tomli`for TOML v1.0.0 support in`pyproject.toml``.   - `#8920 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8920>`_: Added `pytest.Stash`, a facility for plugins to store their data on `~pytest.Config` and `~_pytest.nodes.Node`\s in a type-safe and conflict-free manner.   See [plugin-stash](#plugin-stash) for details.   - `#8953 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8953>`_: `~pytest.RunResult` method `~pytest.RunResult.assert_outcomes` now accepts a``warnings``argument to assert the total number of warnings captured.   - `#8954 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8954>`_:``--debug``flag now accepts a `str` file to route debug logs into, remains defaulted to `pytestdebug.log`.   - `#9023 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9023>`_: Full diffs are now always shown for equality assertions of iterables when   `CI` or``BUILD\_NUMBER`is found in the environment, even when`-v``isn't   used.   - `#9113 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9113>`_: `~pytest.RunResult` method `~pytest.RunResult.assert_outcomes` now accepts a``deselected``argument to assert the total number of deselected tests.   - `#9114 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9114>`_: Added :confval:`pythonpath` setting that adds listed paths to `sys.path` for the duration of the test session. If you currently use the pytest-pythonpath or pytest-srcpaths plugins, you should be able to replace them with built-in `pythonpath` setting.    Improvements ------------  - `#7480 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7480>`_: A deprecation scheduled to be removed in a major version X (e.g. pytest 7, 8, 9, ...) now uses warning category `PytestRemovedInXWarning`,   a subclass of `~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning`,   instead of `~pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning` directly.    See [backwards-compatibility](#backwards-compatibility) for more details.   - `#7864 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7864>`_: Improved error messages when parsing warning filters.    Previously pytest would show an internal traceback, which besides being ugly sometimes would hide the cause   of the problem (for example an``ImportError``while importing a specific warning type).   - `#8335 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8335>`_: Improved `pytest.approx` assertion messages for sequences of numbers.    The assertion messages now dumps a table with the index and the error of each diff.   Example::        >       assert [1, 2, 3, 4] == pytest.approx([1, 3, 3, 5])       E       assert comparison failed for 2 values:       E         Index | Obtained | Expected       E         1     | 2        | 3 +- 3.0e-06       E         3     | 4        | 5 +- 5.0e-06   - `#8403 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8403>`_: By default, pytest will truncate long strings in assert errors so they don't clutter the output too much,   currently at``240`characters by default.    However, in some cases the longer output helps, or is even crucial, to diagnose a failure. Using`-v`will   now increase the truncation threshold to`2400`characters, and`-vv``or higher will disable truncation entirely.   - `#8509 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8509>`_: Fixed issue where `unittest.TestCase.setUpClass` is not called when a test has `/` in its name since pytest 6.2.0.    This refers to the path part in pytest node IDs, e.g.``TestClass::test\_it`in the node ID`tests/test\_file.py::TestClass::test\_it`.    Now, instead of assuming that the test name does not contain`/`, it is assumed that test path does not contain`::``. We plan to hopefully make both of these work in the future.   - `#8803 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8803>`_: It is now possible to add colors to custom log levels on cli log.    By using``add\_color\_level``from a :hook:`pytest_configure` hook, colors can be added::        logging_plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin('logging-plugin')       logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.INFO, 'cyan')       logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.SPAM, 'blue')    See [log_colors](#log_colors) for more information.   - `#8822 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8822>`_: When showing fixture paths in `--fixtures` or `--fixtures-by-test`, fixtures coming from pytest itself now display an elided path, rather than the full path to the file in the `site-packages` directory.   - `#8898 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8898>`_: Complex numbers are now treated like floats and integers when generating parameterization IDs.   - `#9062 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9062>`_:``--stepwise-skip`now implicitly enables`--stepwise``and can be used on its own.   - `#9205 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9205>`_: `pytest.Cache.set` now preserves key order when saving dicts.    Bug Fixes ---------  - `#7124 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/7124>`_: Fixed an issue where``\_\_main\_\_.py`would raise an`ImportError`when`--doctest-modules``was provided.   - `#8061 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8061>`_: Fixed failing``staticmethod``test cases if they are inherited from a parent test class.   - `#8192 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8192>`_:``testdir.makefile`now silently accepts values which don't start with`.`to maintain backward compatibility with older pytest versions.`pytester.makefile`now issues a clearer error if the`.`is missing in the`ext``argument.   - `#8258 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8258>`_: Fixed issue where pytest's``faulthandler``support would not dump traceback on crashes   if the :mod:`faulthandler` module was already enabled during pytest startup (using``python -X dev -m pytest``for example).   - `#8317 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8317>`_: Fixed an issue where illegal directory characters derived from``getpass.getuser()`raised an`OSError``.   - `#8367 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8367>`_: Fix``Class.from\_parent``so it forwards extra keyword arguments to the constructor.   - `#8377 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8377>`_: The test selection options``pytest -k`and`pytest -m`now support matching   names containing forward slash (`/``) characters.   - `#8384 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8384>`_: The``@pytest.mark.skip`decorator now correctly handles its arguments. When the`reason`argument is accidentally given both positional and as a keyword (e.g. because it was confused with`skipif`), a`TypeError`now occurs. Before, such tests were silently skipped, and the positional argument ignored. Additionally,`reason``is now documented correctly as positional or keyword (rather than keyword-only).   - `#8394 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8394>`_: Use private names for internal fixtures that handle classic setup/teardown so that they don't show up with the default``--fixtures`invocation (but they still show up with`--fixtures -v``).   - `#8456 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8456>`_: The :confval:`required_plugins` config option now works correctly when pre-releases of plugins are installed, rather than falsely claiming that those plugins aren't installed at all.   - `#8464 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8464>`_:``-c \<config file\>`now also properly defines`rootdir`as the directory that contains`\<config file\>``.   - `#8503 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8503>`_: `pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath_prepend` no longer fails when``setuptools`is not installed.   It now only calls`pkg\_resources.fixup\_namespace\_packages`if`pkg\_resources``was previously imported, because it is not needed otherwise.   - `#8548 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8548>`_: Introduce fix to handle precision width in``log-cli-format``in turn to fix output coloring for certain formats.   - `#8796 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8796>`_: Fixed internal error when skipping doctests.   - `#8983 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8983>`_: The test selection options``pytest -k`and`pytest -m``now support matching names containing backslash (`\\`) characters.   Backslashes are treated literally, not as escape characters (the values being matched against are already escaped).   - `#8990 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8990>`_: Fix `pytest -vv` crashing with an internal exception `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'relative_to'` in some cases.   - `#9077 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9077>`_: Fixed confusing error message when``request.fspath`/`request.path``was accessed from a session-scoped fixture.   - `#9131 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9131>`_: Fixed the URL used by``--pastebin``to use `bpa.st <http://bpa.st>`__.   - `#9163 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9163>`_: The end line number and end column offset are now properly set for rewritten assert statements.   - `#9169 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9169>`_: Support for the``files`API from`importlib.resources``within rewritten files.   - `#9272 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9272>`_: The nose compatibility module-level fixtures `setup()` and `teardown()` are now only called once per module, instead of for each test function.   They are now called even if object-level `setup`/`teardown` is defined.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - `#4320 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/4320>`_: Improved docs for `pytester.copy_example`.   - `#5105 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/5105>`_: Add automatically generated [plugin-list](#plugin-list). The list is updated on a periodic schedule.   - `#8337 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8337>`_: Recommend `numpy.testing <https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/routines.testing.html>`__ module on `pytest.approx` documentation.   - `#8655 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8655>`_: Help text for``--pdbcls``more accurately reflects the option's behavior.   - `#9210 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9210>`_: Remove incorrect docs about``confcutdir`being a configuration option: it can only be set through the`--confcutdir``command-line option.   - `#9242 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9242>`_: Upgrade readthedocs configuration to use a `newer Ubuntu version <https://blog.readthedocs.com/new-build-specification/>`__` with better unicode support for PDF docs.   - `#9341 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9341>`_: Various methods commonly used for [non-python tests](#non-python-tests) are now correctly documented in the reference docs. They were undocumented previously.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - `#8133 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8133>`_: Migrate to``setuptools\_scm`6.x to use`SETUPTOOLS\_SCM\_PRETEND\_VERSION\_FOR\_PYTEST``for more robust release tooling.   - `#8174 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8174>`_: The following changes have been made to internal pytest types/functions:    - The``\_pytest.code.getfslineno()`function returns`Path`instead of`py.path.local`.   - The`\_pytest.python.path\_matches\_patterns()`function takes`Path`instead of`py.path.local`.   - The`\_pytest.\_code.Traceback.cut()`function accepts any`os.PathLike\[str\]`, not just`py.path.local``.   - `#8248 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8248>`_: Internal Restructure: let``python.PyObjMixin`inherit from`nodes.Node``to carry over typing information.   - `#8432 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8432>`_: Improve error message when `pytest.skip` is used at module level without passing `allow_module_level=True`.   - `#8818 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8818>`_: Ensure``regendoc`opts out of`TOX\_ENV``cachedir selection to ensure independent example test runs.   - `#8913 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8913>`_: The private``CallSpec2.\_arg2scopenum``attribute has been removed after an internal refactoring.   - `#8967 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/8967>`_: :hook:`pytest_assertion_pass` is no longer considered experimental and   future changes to it will be considered more carefully.   - `#9202 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9202>`_: Add github action to upload coverage report to codecov instead of bash uploader.   - `#9225 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9225>`_: Changed the command used to create sdist and wheel artifacts: using the build package instead of setup.py.   - `#9351 <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/9351>`_: Correct minor typos in doc/en/example/special.rst.   pytest 6.2.5 (2021-08-29) =========================   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`8494`: Python 3.10 is now supported.   - :issue:`9040`: Enable compatibility with``pluggy 1.0``or later.   pytest 6.2.4 (2021-05-04) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`8539`: Fixed assertion rewriting on Python 3.10.   pytest 6.2.3 (2021-04-03) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`8414`: pytest used to create directories under``/tmp`with world-readable   permissions. This means that any user in the system was able to read   information written by tests in temporary directories (such as those created by   the`tmp\_path`/`tmpdir`fixture). Now the directories are created with   private permissions.    pytest used to silently use a preexisting`/tmp/pytest-of-\<username\>``directory,   even if owned by another user. This means another user could pre-create such a   directory and gain control of another user's temporary directory. Now such a   condition results in an error.   pytest 6.2.2 (2021-01-25) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`8152`: Fixed "(<Skipped instance>)" being shown as a skip reason in the verbose test summary line when the reason is empty.   - :issue:`8249`: Fix the``faulthandler`plugin for occasions when running with`twisted.logger`and using`pytest --capture=no``.   pytest 6.2.1 (2020-12-15) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7678`: Fixed bug where``ImportPathMismatchError``would be raised for files compiled in   the host and loaded later from an UNC mounted path (Windows).   - :issue:`8132`: Fixed regression in``approx`: in 6.2.0`approx`no longer raises`TypeError`when dealing with non-numeric types, falling back to normal comparison.   Before 6.2.0, array types like tf.DeviceArray fell through to the scalar case,   and happened to compare correctly to a scalar if they had only one element.   After 6.2.0, these types began failing, because they inherited neither from   standard Python number hierarchy nor from`numpy.ndarray`.`approx`now converts arguments to`numpy.ndarray``if they expose the array   protocol and are not scalars. This treats array-like objects like numpy arrays,   regardless of size.   pytest 6.2.0 (2020-12-12) =========================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - :issue:`7808`: pytest now supports python3.6+ only.    Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`7469`: Directly constructing/calling the following classes/functions is now deprecated:    -``\_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache`-`\_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.for\_config()`-`\_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.clear\_cache()`-`\_pytest.cacheprovider.Cache.cache\_dir\_from\_config()`-`\_pytest.capture.CaptureFixture`-`\_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest`-`\_pytest.fixtures.SubRequest`-`\_pytest.logging.LogCaptureFixture`-`\_pytest.pytester.Pytester`-`\_pytest.pytester.Testdir`-`\_pytest.recwarn.WarningsRecorder`-`\_pytest.recwarn.WarningsChecker`-`\_pytest.tmpdir.TempPathFactory`-`\_pytest.tmpdir.TempdirFactory``These have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.0.0.   - :issue:`7530`: The``--strict`command-line option has been deprecated, use`--strict-markers`instead.    We have plans to maybe in the future to reintroduce`--strict`and make it an encompassing flag for all strictness   related options (`--strict-markers`and`--strict-config``at the moment, more might be introduced in the future).   - :issue:`7988`: The``@pytest.yield\_fixture``decorator/function is now deprecated. Use `pytest.fixture` instead.``yield\_fixture`has been an alias for`fixture``for a very long time, so can be search/replaced safely.    Features --------  - :issue:`5299`: pytest now warns about unraisable exceptions and unhandled thread exceptions that occur in tests on Python>=3.8.   See [unraisable](#unraisable) for more information.   - :issue:`7425`: New :fixture:`pytester` fixture, which is identical to :fixture:`testdir` but its methods return `pathlib.Path` when appropriate instead of``py.path.local``.    This is part of the movement to use `pathlib.Path` objects internally, in order to remove the dependency to``py`in the future.    Internally, the old`pytest.Testdir``is now a thin wrapper around `~pytest.Pytester`, preserving the old interface.   - :issue:`7695`: A new hook was added, `pytest_markeval_namespace` which should return a dictionary.   This dictionary will be used to augment the "global" variables available to evaluate skipif/xfail/xpass markers.    Pseudo example``conftest.py`:`\`python def pytest\_markeval\_namespace(): return {"color": "red"}

> `test_func.py`:
> 
> ``` python
> @pytest.mark.skipif("color == 'blue'", reason="Color is not red")
> def test_func():
>     assert False
> ```

  - `8006`: It is now possible to construct a <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.MonkeyPatch</span> object directly as `pytest.MonkeyPatch()`, in cases when the `monkeypatch` fixture cannot be used. Previously some users imported it from the private <span class="title-ref">\_pytest.monkeypatch.MonkeyPatch</span> namespace.
    
    Additionally, <span class="title-ref">MonkeyPatch.context \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.context\></span> is now a classmethod, and can be used as `with MonkeyPatch.context() as mp: ...`. This is the recommended way to use `MonkeyPatch` directly, since unlike the `monkeypatch` fixture, an instance created directly is not `undo()`-ed automatically.

Improvements `` ` ------------  - :issue:`1265`: Added an ``\_\_str\_\_``implementation to the `~pytest.LineMatcher` class which is returned from``pytester.run\_pytest().stdout`and similar. It returns the entire output, like the existing`str()``method.   - :issue:`2044`: Verbose mode now shows the reason that a test was skipped in the test's terminal line after the "SKIPPED", "XFAIL" or "XPASS".   - :issue:`7469` The types of builtin pytest fixtures are now exported so they may be used in type annotations of test functions.   The newly-exported types are:    -``pytest.FixtureRequest``for the :fixture:`request` fixture.   -``pytest.Cache``for the :fixture:`cache` fixture.   -``pytest.CaptureFixture\[str\]``for the :fixture:`capfd` and :fixture:`capsys` fixtures.   -``pytest.CaptureFixture\[bytes\]``for the :fixture:`capfdbinary` and :fixture:`capsysbinary` fixtures.   -``pytest.LogCaptureFixture``for the :fixture:`caplog` fixture.   -``pytest.Pytester``for the :fixture:`pytester` fixture.   -``pytest.Testdir``for the :fixture:`testdir` fixture.   -``pytest.TempdirFactory``for the :fixture:`tmpdir_factory` fixture.   -``pytest.TempPathFactory``for the :fixture:`tmp_path_factory` fixture.   -``pytest.MonkeyPatch``for the :fixture:`monkeypatch` fixture.   -``pytest.WarningsRecorder``for the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture.    Constructing them is not supported (except for `MonkeyPatch`); they are only meant for use in type annotations.   Doing so will emit a deprecation warning, and may become a hard-error in pytest 8.0.    Subclassing them is also not supported. This is not currently enforced at runtime, but is detected by type-checkers such as mypy.   - :issue:`7527`: When a comparison between `namedtuple <collections.namedtuple>` instances of the same type fails, pytest now shows the differing field names (possibly nested) instead of their indexes.   - :issue:`7615`: `Node.warn <_pytest.nodes.Node.warn>` now permits any subclass of `Warning`, not just `PytestWarning <pytest.PytestWarning>`.   - :issue:`7701`: Improved reporting when using``--collected-only``. It will now show the number of collected tests in the summary stats.   - :issue:`7710`: Use strict equality comparison for non-numeric types in `pytest.approx` instead of   raising `TypeError`.    This was the undocumented behavior before 3.7, but is now officially a supported feature.   - :issue:`7938`: New``--sw-skip`argument which is a shorthand for`--stepwise-skip``.   - :issue:`8023`: Added``'node\_modules'``to default value for :confval:`norecursedirs`.   - :issue:`8032`: `doClassCleanups <unittest.TestCase.doClassCleanups>` (introduced in :mod:`unittest` in Python and 3.8) is now called appropriately.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4824`: Fixed quadratic behavior and improved performance of collection of items using autouse fixtures and xunit fixtures.   - :issue:`7758`: Fixed an issue where some files in packages are getting lost from``--lf``even though they contain tests that failed. Regressed in pytest 5.4.0.   - :issue:`7911`: Directories created by by :fixture:`tmp_path` and :fixture:`tmpdir` are now considered stale after 3 days without modification (previous value was 3 hours) to avoid deleting directories still in use in long running test suites.   - :issue:`7913`: Fixed a crash or hang in `pytester.spawn <pytest.Pytester.spawn>` when the :mod:`readline` module is involved.   - :issue:`7951`: Fixed handling of recursive symlinks when collecting tests.   - :issue:`7981`: Fixed symlinked directories not being followed during collection. Regressed in pytest 6.1.0.   - :issue:`8016`: Fixed only one doctest being collected when using``pytest --doctest-modules path/to/an/\_\_init\_\_.py``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`7429`: Add more information and use cases about skipping doctests.   - :issue:`7780`: Classes which should not be inherited from are now marked``final class``in the API reference.   - :issue:`7872`:``\_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser.addini()`accepts explicit`None`and`"string"``.   - :issue:`7878`: In pull request section, ask to commit after editing changelog and authors file.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`7802`: The``attrs``dependency requirement is now >=19.2.0 instead of >=17.4.0.   - :issue:`8014`: `.pyc` files created by pytest's assertion rewriting now conform to the newer :pep:`552` format on Python>=3.7.   (These files are internal and only interpreted by pytest itself.)   pytest 6.1.2 (2020-10-28) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7758`: Fixed an issue where some files in packages are getting lost from``--lf``even though they contain tests that failed. Regressed in pytest 5.4.0.   - :issue:`7911`: Directories created by `tmpdir` are now considered stale after 3 days without modification (previous value was 3 hours) to avoid deleting directories still in use in long running test suites.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`7815`: Improve deprecation warning message for``pytest.\_fillfuncargs()``.   pytest 6.1.1 (2020-10-03) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7807`: Fixed regression in pytest 6.1.0 causing incorrect rootdir to be determined in some non-trivial cases where parent directories have config files as well.   - :issue:`7814`: Fixed crash in header reporting when :confval:`testpaths` is used and contains absolute paths (regression in 6.1.0).   pytest 6.1.0 (2020-09-26) =========================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - :issue:`5585`: As per our policy, the following features which have been deprecated in the 5.X series are now   removed:    * The``funcargnames`read-only property of`FixtureRequest`,`Metafunc`, and`Function`classes. Use`fixturenames`attribute.    *`@pytest.fixture`no longer supports positional arguments, pass all arguments by keyword instead.    * Direct construction of`Node`subclasses now raise an error, use`from\_parent`instead.    * The default value for`junit\_family`has changed to`xunit2`. If you require the old format, add`junit\_family=xunit1`to your configuration file.    * The`TerminalReporter`no longer has a`writer`attribute. Plugin authors may use the public functions of the`TerminalReporter`instead of accessing the`TerminalWriter`object directly.    * The`--result-log``option has been removed. Users are recommended to use the `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__ plugin instead.     For more information consult :std[deprecations](deprecations.md) in the docs.    Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`6981`: The``pytest.collect`module is deprecated: all its names can be imported from`pytest``directly.   - :issue:`7097`: The``pytest.\_fillfuncargs``function is deprecated. This function was kept   for backward compatibility with an older plugin.    It's functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace   it, use `function._request._fillfixtures()` instead, though note this is not   a public API and may break in the future.   - :issue:`7210`: The special``-k '-expr'`syntax to`-k`is deprecated. Use`-k 'not expr'`instead.    The special`-k 'expr:'`syntax to`-k``is deprecated. Please open an issue   if you use this and want a replacement.   - :issue:`7255`: The``pytest\_warning\_captured``hook is deprecated in favor   of :hook:`pytest_warning_recorded`, and will be removed in a future version.   - :issue:`7648`: The``gethookproxy()`and`isinitpath()`methods of`FSCollector`and`Package`are deprecated;   use`self.session.gethookproxy()`and`self.session.isinitpath()``instead.   This should work on all pytest versions.    Features --------  - :issue:`7667`: New``--durations-min`command-line flag controls the minimal duration for inclusion in the slowest list of tests shown by`--durations`. Previously this was hard-coded to`0.005s``.    Improvements ------------  - :issue:`6681`: Internal pytest warnings issued during the early stages of initialization are now properly handled and can filtered through :confval:`filterwarnings` or``--pythonwarnings/-W``.    This also fixes a number of long standing issues: :issue:`2891`, :issue:`7620`, :issue:`7426`.   - :issue:`7572`: When a plugin listed in``required\_plugins`is missing or an unknown config key is used with`--strict-config``, a simple error message is now shown instead of a stacktrace.   - :issue:`7685`: Added two new attributes `rootpath <pytest.Config.rootpath>` and `inipath <pytest.Config.inipath>` to `~pytest.Config`.   These attributes are `pathlib.Path` versions of the existing``rootdir`and`inifile``attributes,   and should be preferred over them when possible.   - :issue:`7780`: Public classes which are not designed to be inherited from are now marked `@final <typing.final>`.   Code which inherits from these classes will trigger a type-checking (e.g. mypy) error, but will still work in runtime.   Currently the``final``designation does not appear in the API Reference but hopefully will in the future.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`1953`: Fixed error when overwriting a parametrized fixture, while also reusing the super fixture value.``\`python \# conftest.py import pytest

> @pytest.fixture(params=\[1, 2\]) def foo(request): return request.param
> 
> \# test\_foo.py import pytest
> 
> @pytest.fixture def foo(foo): return foo \* 2

  - `4984`: Fixed an internal error crash with `IndexError: list index out of range` when collecting a module which starts with a decorated function, the decorator raises, and assertion rewriting is enabled.
  - `7591`: pylint shouldn't complain anymore about unimplemented abstract methods when inheriting from \[File \<non-python tests\>\](\#file-\<non-python-tests\>).
  - `7628`: Fixed test collection when a full path without a drive letter was passed to pytest on Windows (for example `\projects\tests\test.py` instead of `c:\projects\tests\pytest.py`).
  - `7638`: Fix handling of command-line options that appear as paths but trigger an OS-level syntax error on Windows, such as the options used internally by `pytest-xdist`.
  - `7742`: Fixed INTERNALERROR when accessing locals / globals with faulty `exec`.

Improved Documentation `` ` ----------------------  - :issue:`1477`: Removed faq.rst and its reference in contents.rst.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`7536`: The internal ``junitxml`plugin has rewritten to use`xml.etree.ElementTree``.   The order of attributes in XML elements might differ. Some unneeded escaping is   no longer performed.   - :issue:`7587`: The dependency on the``more-itertools``package has been removed.   - :issue:`7631`: The result type of `capfd.readouterr() <pytest.CaptureFixture.readouterr>` (and similar) is no longer a namedtuple,   but should behave like one in all respects. This was done for technical reasons.   - :issue:`7671`: When collecting tests, pytest finds test classes and functions by examining the   attributes of python objects (modules, classes and instances). To speed up this   process, pytest now ignores builtin attributes (like``\_\_class\_\_`,`\_\_delattr\_\_`and`\_\_new\_\_``) without consulting the :confval:`python_classes` and   :confval:`python_functions` configuration options and without passing them to plugins   using the :hook:`pytest_pycollect_makeitem` hook.   pytest 6.0.2 (2020-09-04) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7148`: Fixed``--log-cli`potentially causing unrelated`print``output to be swallowed.   - :issue:`7672`: Fixed log-capturing level restored incorrectly if``caplog.set\_level``is called more than once.   - :issue:`7686`: Fixed `NotSetType.token` being used as the parameter ID when the parametrization list is empty.   Regressed in pytest 6.0.0.   - :issue:`7707`: Fix internal error when handling some exceptions that contain multiple lines or the style uses multiple lines (``--tb=line``for example).   pytest 6.0.1 (2020-07-30) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7394`: Passing an empty``help`value to`Parser.add\_option`is now accepted instead of crashing when running`pytest --help`.   Passing`None`raises a more informative`TypeError``.   - :issue:`7558`: Fix pylint``not-callable`lint on`pytest.mark.parametrize()`and the other builtin marks:`skip`,`skipif`,`xfail`,`usefixtures`,`filterwarnings``.   - :issue:`7559`: Fix regression in plugins using``TestReport.longreprtext`(such as`pytest-html`) when`TestReport.longrepr``is not a string.   - :issue:`7569`: Fix logging capture handler's level not reset on teardown after a call to``caplog.set\_level()``.   pytest 6.0.0 (2020-07-28) =========================  (**Please see the full set of changes for this release also in the 6.0.0rc1 notes below**)  Breaking Changes ----------------  - :issue:`5584`: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**    Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as   possible, all warnings of type``PytestDeprecationWarning`now generate errors   instead of warning messages.    **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 6.1**, so please consult the   :std[deprecations](deprecations.md) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.    In the pytest`6.0.X`series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a   stopgap measure by adding this to your`pytest.ini`file:`\`ini \[pytest\] filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

> But this will stop working when pytest `6.1` is released.
> 
> **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to `5584`.

  - `7472`: The `exec_()` and `is_true()` methods of `_pytest._code.Frame` have been removed.

Features `` ` --------  - :issue:`7464`: Added support for :envvar:`NO_COLOR` and :envvar:`FORCE_COLOR` environment variables to control colored output.    Improvements ------------  - :issue:`7467`: ``--log-file`CLI option and`log\_file``ini marker now create subdirectories if needed.   - :issue:`7489`: The `pytest.raises` function has a clearer error message when``match``equals the obtained string but is not a regex match. In this case it is suggested to escape the regex.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`7392`: Fix the reported location of tests skipped with``@pytest.mark.skip`when`--runxfail``is used.   - :issue:`7491`: :fixture:`tmpdir` and :fixture:`tmp_path` no longer raise an error if the lock to check for   stale temporary directories is not accessible.   - :issue:`7517`: Preserve line endings when captured via``capfd``.   - :issue:`7534`: Restored the previous formatting of``TracebackEntry.\_\_str\_\_``which was changed by accident.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`7422`: Clarified when the``usefixtures``mark can apply fixtures to test.   - :issue:`7441`: Add a note about``-q``option used in getting started guide.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`7389`: Fixture scope``package``is no longer considered experimental.   pytest 6.0.0rc1 (2020-07-08) ============================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - :issue:`1316`:``TestReport.longrepr`is now always an instance of`ReprExceptionInfo`. Previously it was a`str`when a test failed with`pytest.fail(..., pytrace=False)``.   - :issue:`5965`: symlinks are no longer resolved during collection and matching `conftest.py` files with test file paths.    Resolving symlinks for the current directory and during collection was introduced as a bugfix in 3.9.0, but it actually is a new feature which had unfortunate consequences in Windows and surprising results in other platforms.    The team decided to step back on resolving symlinks at all, planning to review this in the future with a more solid solution (see discussion in   :pr:`6523` for details).    This might break test suites which made use of this feature; the fix is to create a symlink   for the entire test tree, and not only to partial files/tress as it was possible previously.   - :issue:`6505`:``Testdir.run().parseoutcomes()`now always returns the parsed nouns in plural form.    Originally`parseoutcomes()`would always returns the nouns in plural form, but a change   meant to improve the terminal summary by using singular form single items (`1 warning`or`1 error`)   caused an unintended regression by changing the keys returned by`parseoutcomes()`.    Now the API guarantees to always return the plural form, so calls like this:`\`python result = testdir.runpytest() result.assert\_outcomes(error=1)

> Need to be changed to:
> 
> ``` python
> result = testdir.runpytest()
> result.assert_outcomes(errors=1)
> ```

  - `6903`: The `os.dup()` function is now assumed to exist. We are not aware of any supported Python 3 implementations which do not provide it.

  - `7040`: `-k` no longer matches against the names of the directories outside the test session root.
    
    Also, `pytest.Package.name` is now just the name of the directory containing the package's `__init__.py` file, instead of the full path. This is consistent with how the other nodes are named, and also one of the reasons why `-k` would match against any directory containing the test suite.

  - `7122`: Expressions given to the `-m` and `-k` options are no longer evaluated using Python's <span class="title-ref">eval</span>. The format supports `or`, `and`, `not`, parenthesis and general identifiers to match against. Python constants, keywords or other operators are no longer evaluated differently.

  - `7135`: Pytest now uses its own `TerminalWriter` class instead of using the one from the `py` library. Plugins generally access this class through `TerminalReporter.writer`, `TerminalReporter.write()` (and similar methods), or `_pytest.config.create_terminal_writer()`.
    
    The following breaking changes were made:
    
      - Output (`write()` method and others) no longer flush implicitly; the flushing behavior of the underlying file is respected. To flush explicitly (for example, if you want output to be shown before an end-of-line is printed), use `write(flush=True)` or `terminal_writer.flush()`.
      - Explicit Windows console support was removed, delegated to the colorama library.
      - Support for writing `bytes` was removed.
      - The `reline` method and `chars_on_current_line` property were removed.
      - The `stringio` and `encoding` arguments was removed.
      - Support for passing a callable instead of a file was removed.

  - `7224`: The <span class="title-ref">item.catch\_log\_handler</span> and <span class="title-ref">item.catch\_log\_handlers</span> attributes, set by the logging plugin and never meant to be public, are no longer available.
    
    The deprecated `--no-print-logs` option and `log_print` ini option are removed. Use `--show-capture` instead.

  - `7226`: Removed the unused `args` parameter from `pytest.Function.__init__`.

  - `7418`: Removed the <span class="title-ref">pytest\_doctest\_prepare\_content</span> hook specification. This hook hasn't been triggered by pytest for at least 10 years.

  - `7438`: Some changes were made to the internal `_pytest._code.source`, listed here for the benefit of plugin authors who may be using it:
    
      - The `deindent` argument to `Source()` has been removed, now it is always true.
      - Support for zero or multiple arguments to `Source()` has been removed.
      - Support for comparing `Source` with an `str` has been removed.
      - The methods `Source.isparseable()` and `Source.putaround()` have been removed.
      - The method `Source.compile()` and function `_pytest._code.compile()` have been removed; use plain `compile()` instead.
      - The function `_pytest._code.source.getsource()` has been removed; use `Source()` directly instead.

Deprecations `` ` ------------  - :issue:`7210`: The special ``-k '-expr'`syntax to`-k`is deprecated. Use`-k 'not expr'`instead.    The special`-k 'expr:'`syntax to`-k``is deprecated. Please open an issue   if you use this and want a replacement.  - :issue:`4049`:``pytest\_warning\_captured`is deprecated in favor of the`pytest\_warning\_recorded``hook.   Features --------  - :issue:`1556`: pytest now supports``pyproject.toml`files for configuration.    The configuration options is similar to the one available in other formats, but must be defined   in a`\[tool.pytest.ini\_options\]`table to be picked up by pytest:`\`toml \# pyproject.toml \[tool.pytest.ini\_options\] minversion = "6.0" addopts = "-ra -q" testpaths = \[ "tests", "integration", \]

> More information can be found \[in the docs \<config file formats\>\](\#in-the-docs-\<config-file-formats\>).

  - `3342`: pytest now includes inline type annotations and exposes them to user programs. Most of the user-facing API is covered, as well as internal code.
    
    If you are running a type checker such as mypy on your tests, you may start noticing type errors indicating incorrect usage. If you run into an error that you believe to be incorrect, please let us know in an issue.
    
    The types were developed against mypy version 0.780. Versions before 0.750 are known not to work. We recommend using the latest version. Other type checkers may work as well, but they are not officially verified to work by pytest yet.

  - `4049`: Introduced a new hook named <span class="title-ref">pytest\_warning\_recorded</span> to convey information about warnings captured by the internal <span class="title-ref">pytest</span> warnings plugin.
    
    This hook is meant to replace <span class="title-ref">pytest\_warning\_captured</span>, which is deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

  - `6471`: New command-line flags:
    
      - \`--no-header\`: disables the initial header, including platform, version, and plugins.
      - \`--no-summary\`: disables the final test summary, including warnings.

  - `6856`: A warning is now shown when an unknown key is read from a config INI file.
    
    The <span class="title-ref">--strict-config</span> flag has been added to treat these warnings as errors.

  - `6906`: Added <span class="title-ref">--code-highlight</span> command line option to enable/disable code highlighting in terminal output.

  - `7245`: New `--import-mode=importlib` option that uses `importlib` to import test modules.
    
    Traditionally pytest used `__import__` while changing `sys.path` to import test modules (which also changes `sys.modules` as a side-effect), which works but has a number of drawbacks, like requiring test modules that don't live in packages to have unique names (as they need to reside under a unique name in `sys.modules`).
    
    `--import-mode=importlib` uses more fine-grained import mechanisms from `importlib` which don't require pytest to change `sys.path` or `sys.modules` at all, eliminating much of the drawbacks of the previous mode.
    
    We intend to make `--import-mode=importlib` the default in future versions, so users are encouraged to try the new mode and provide feedback (both positive or negative) in issue `7245`.
    
    You can read more about this option in :std\[the documentation \<import-modes\>\](\#the-documentation-\<import-modes\>).

  - `7305`: New `required_plugins` configuration option allows the user to specify a list of plugins, including version information, that are required for pytest to run. An error is raised if any required plugins are not found when running pytest.

Improvements `` ` ------------  - :issue:`4375`: The ``pytest`command now suppresses the`BrokenPipeError`error message that   is printed to stderr when the output of`pytest`is piped and the pipe is   closed by the piped-to program (common examples are`less`and`head``).   - :issue:`4391`: Improved precision of test durations measurement.``CallInfo`items now have a new`\<CallInfo\>.duration`attribute, created using`time.perf\_counter()`. This attribute is used to fill the`\<TestReport\>.duration`attribute, which is more accurate than the previous`\<CallInfo\>.stop - \<CallInfo\>.start`(as these are based on`time.time()``).   - :issue:`4675`: Rich comparison for dataclasses and `attrs`-classes is now recursive.   - :issue:`6285`: Exposed the `pytest.FixtureLookupError` exception which is raised by `request.getfixturevalue()`   (where `request` is a `FixtureRequest` fixture) when a fixture with the given name cannot be returned.   - :issue:`6433`: If an error is encountered while formatting the message in a logging call, for   example``logging.warning("oh no\!: %s: %s", "first")`(a second argument is   missing), pytest now propagates the error, likely causing the test to fail.    Previously, such a mistake would cause an error to be printed to stderr, which   is not displayed by default for passing tests. This change makes the mistake   visible during testing.    You may suppress this behavior temporarily or permanently by setting`logging.raiseExceptions = False``.   - :issue:`6817`: Explicit new-lines in help texts of command-line options are preserved, allowing plugins better control   of the help displayed to users.   - :issue:`6940`: When using the``--duration``option, the terminal message output is now more precise about the number and duration of hidden items.   - :issue:`6991`: Collected files are displayed after any reports from hooks, e.g. the status from``--lf``.   - :issue:`7091`: When``fd`capturing is used, through`--capture=fd`or the`capfd`and`capfdbinary``fixtures, and the file descriptor (0, 1, 2) cannot be   duplicated, FD capturing is still performed. Previously, direct writes to the   file descriptors would fail or be lost in this case.   - :issue:`7119`: Exit with an error if the``--basetemp``argument is empty, is the current working directory or is one of the parent directories.   This is done to protect against accidental data loss, as any directory passed to this argument is cleared.   - :issue:`7128`: `pytest --version` now displays just the pytest version, while `pytest --version --version` displays more verbose information including plugins. This is more consistent with how other tools show `--version`.   - :issue:`7133`: `caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` will now override any :confval:`log_level` set via the CLI or configuration file.   - :issue:`7159`: `caplog.set_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.set_level>` and `caplog.at_level() <pytest.LogCaptureFixture.at_level>` no longer affect   the level of logs that are shown in the *Captured log report* report section.   - :issue:`7348`: Improve recursive diff report for comparison asserts on dataclasses / attrs.   - :issue:`7385`:``--junitxml`now includes the exception cause in the`message`XML attribute for failures during setup and teardown.    Previously:`\`xml \<error message="test setup failure"\>

> Now:
> 
> ``` xml
> <error message="failed on setup with &quot;ValueError: Some error during setup&quot;">
> ```

Bug Fixes `` ` ---------  - :issue:`1120`: Fix issue where directories from :fixture:`tmpdir` are not removed properly when multiple instances of pytest are running in parallel.   - :issue:`4583`: Prevent crashing and provide a user-friendly error when a marker expression (`-m`) invoking of `eval` raises any exception.   - :issue:`4677`: The path shown in the summary report for SKIPPED tests is now always relative. Previously it was sometimes absolute.   - :issue:`5456`: Fix a possible race condition when trying to remove lock files used to control access to folders   created by :fixture:`tmp_path` and :fixture:`tmpdir`.   - :issue:`6240`: Fixes an issue where logging during collection step caused duplication of log   messages to stderr.   - :issue:`6428`: Paths appearing in error messages are now correct in case the current working directory has   changed since the start of the session.   - :issue:`6755`: Support deleting paths longer than 260 characters on windows created inside :fixture:`tmpdir`.   - :issue:`6871`: Fix crash with captured output when using :fixture:`capsysbinary`.   - :issue:`6909`: Revert the change introduced by :pr:`6330`, which required all arguments to ``@pytest.mark.parametrize``to be explicitly defined in the function signature.    The intention of the original change was to remove what was expected to be an unintended/surprising behavior, but it turns out many people relied on it, so the restriction has been reverted.   - :issue:`6910`: Fix crash when plugins return an unknown stats while using the``--reportlog``option.   - :issue:`6924`: Ensure a``unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase``is actually awaited.   - :issue:`6925`: Fix `TerminalRepr` instances to be hashable again.   - :issue:`6947`: Fix regression where functions registered with `unittest.TestCase.addCleanup` were not being called on test failures.   - :issue:`6951`: Allow users to still set the deprecated``TerminalReporter.writer``attribute.   - :issue:`6956`: Prevent pytest from printing `ConftestImportFailure` traceback to stdout.   - :issue:`6991`: Fix regressions with `--lf` filtering too much since pytest 5.4.   - :issue:`6992`: Revert "tmpdir: clean up indirection via config for factories" :issue:`6767` as it breaks pytest-xdist.   - :issue:`7061`: When a yielding fixture fails to yield a value, report a test setup error instead of crashing.   - :issue:`7076`: The path of file skipped by``@pytest.mark.skip``in the SKIPPED report is now relative to invocation directory. Previously it was relative to root directory.   - :issue:`7110`: Fixed regression:``asyncbase.TestCase``tests are executed correctly again.   - :issue:`7126`:``--setup-show`now doesn't raise an error when a bytes value is used as a`parametrize`parameter when Python is called with the`-bb``flag.   - :issue:`7143`: Fix `pytest.File.from_parent <_pytest.nodes.Node.from_parent>` so it forwards extra keyword arguments to the constructor.   - :issue:`7145`: Classes with broken``\_\_getattribute\_\_``methods are displayed correctly during failures.   - :issue:`7150`: Prevent hiding the underlying exception when``ConfTestImportFailure``is raised.   - :issue:`7180`: Fix``\_is\_setup\_py``for files encoded differently than locale.   - :issue:`7215`: Fix regression where running with``--pdb``would call `unittest.TestCase.tearDown` for skipped tests.   - :issue:`7253`: When using``pytest.fixture`on a function directly, as in`pytest.fixture(func)`,   if the`autouse`or`params``arguments are also passed, the function is no longer   ignored, but is marked as a fixture.   - :issue:`7360`: Fix possibly incorrect evaluation of string expressions passed to``pytest.mark.skipif`and`pytest.mark.xfail``,   in rare circumstances where the exact same string is used but refers to different global values.   - :issue:`7383`: Fixed exception causes all over the codebase, i.e. use `raise new_exception from old_exception` when wrapping an exception.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`7202`: The development guide now links to the contributing section of the docs and `RELEASING.rst` on GitHub.   - :issue:`7233`: Add a note about``--strict`and`--strict-markers``and the preference for the latter one.   - :issue:`7345`: Explain indirect parametrization and markers for fixtures.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`7035`: The``originalname`attribute of`\_pytest.python.Function`now defaults to`name``if not   provided explicitly, and is always set.   - :issue:`7264`: The dependency on the``wcwidth``package has been removed.   - :issue:`7291`: Replaced``py.iniconfig``with :pypi:`iniconfig`.   - :issue:`7295`:``src/\_pytest/config/\_\_init\_\_.py`now uses the`warnings`module to report warnings instead of`sys.stderr.write``.   - :issue:`7356`: Remove last internal uses of deprecated *slave* term from old``pytest-xdist``.   - :issue:`7357`:``py``>=1.8.2 is now required.   pytest 5.4.3 (2020-06-02) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6428`: Paths appearing in error messages are now correct in case the current working directory has   changed since the start of the session.   - :issue:`6755`: Support deleting paths longer than 260 characters on windows created inside tmpdir.   - :issue:`6956`: Prevent pytest from printing ConftestImportFailure traceback to stdout.   - :issue:`7150`: Prevent hiding the underlying exception when``ConfTestImportFailure``is raised.   - :issue:`7215`: Fix regression where running with``--pdb`would call the`tearDown`methods of`unittest.TestCase``subclasses for skipped tests.   pytest 5.4.2 (2020-05-08) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6871`: Fix crash with captured output when using the :fixture:`capsysbinary fixture <capsysbinary>`.   - :issue:`6924`: Ensure a``unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase``is actually awaited.   - :issue:`6925`: Fix TerminalRepr instances to be hashable again.   - :issue:`6947`: Fix regression where functions registered with``TestCase.addCleanup``were not being called on test failures.   - :issue:`6951`: Allow users to still set the deprecated``TerminalReporter.writer``attribute.   - :issue:`6992`: Revert "tmpdir: clean up indirection via config for factories" #6767 as it breaks pytest-xdist.   - :issue:`7110`: Fixed regression:``asyncbase.TestCase``tests are executed correctly again.   - :issue:`7143`: Fix``File.from\_parent``so it forwards extra keyword arguments to the constructor.   - :issue:`7145`: Classes with broken``\_\_getattribute\_\_``methods are displayed correctly during failures.   - :issue:`7180`: Fix``\_is\_setup\_py``for files encoded differently than locale.   pytest 5.4.1 (2020-03-13) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6909`: Revert the change introduced by :pr:`6330`, which required all arguments to``@pytest.mark.parametrize``to be explicitly defined in the function signature.    The intention of the original change was to remove what was expected to be an unintended/surprising behavior, but it turns out many people relied on it, so the restriction has been reverted.   - :issue:`6910`: Fix crash when plugins return an unknown stats while using the``--reportlog``option.   pytest 5.4.0 (2020-03-12) =========================  Breaking Changes ----------------  - :issue:`6316`: Matching of``-k EXPRESSION``to test names is now case-insensitive.   - :issue:`6443`: Plugins specified with``-p`are now loaded after internal plugins, which results in their hooks being called *before* the internal ones.    This makes the`-p`behavior consistent with`PYTEST\_PLUGINS``.   - :issue:`6637`: Removed the long-deprecated``pytest\_itemstart``hook.    This hook has been marked as deprecated and not been even called by pytest for over 10 years now.   - :issue:`6673`: Reversed / fix meaning of "+/-" in error diffs.  "-" means that something expected is missing in the result and "+" means that there are unexpected extras in the result.   - :issue:`6737`: The``cached\_result`attribute of`FixtureDef`is now set to`None`when   the result is unavailable, instead of being deleted.    If your plugin performs checks like`hasattr(fixturedef, 'cached\_result')`,   for example in a`pytest\_fixture\_post\_finalizer`hook implementation, replace   it with`fixturedef.cached\_result is not None`. If you`del`the attribute,   set it to`None``instead.    Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`3238`: Option``--no-print-logs`is deprecated and meant to be removed in a future release. If you use`--no-print-logs`, please try out`--show-capture`and   provide feedback.`--show-capture`command-line option was added in`pytest 3.5.0`and allows to specify how to   display captured output when tests fail:`no`,`stdout`,`stderr`,`log`or`all``(the default).   - :issue:`571`: Deprecate the unused/broken `pytest_collect_directory` hook.   It was misaligned since the removal of the``Directory``collector in 2010   and incorrect/unusable as soon as collection was split from test execution.   - :issue:`5975`: Deprecate using direct constructors for``Nodes`.    Instead they are now constructed via`Node.from\_parent`.    This transitional mechanism enables us to untangle the very intensely   entangled`Node``relationships by enforcing more controlled creation/configuration patterns.    As part of this change, session/config are already disallowed parameters and as we work on the details we might need disallow a few more as well.    Subclasses are expected to use `super().from_parent` if they intend to expand the creation of `Nodes`.   - :issue:`6779`: The``TerminalReporter.writer`attribute has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This   was inadvertently exposed as part of the public API of that plugin and ties it too much   with`py.io.TerminalWriter``.    Features --------  - :issue:`4597`: New [--capture=tee-sys <capture-method>](#--capture=tee-sys-<capture-method>) option to allow both live printing and capturing of test output.   - :issue:`5712`: Now all arguments to``@pytest.mark.parametrize`need to be explicitly declared in the function signature or via`indirect``.   Previously it was possible to omit an argument if a fixture with the same name existed, which was just an accident of implementation and was not meant to be a part of the API.   - :issue:`6454`: Changed default for `-r` to `fE`, which displays failures and errors in the [short test summary <pytest.detailed_failed_tests_usage>](#short-test-summary-<pytest.detailed_failed_tests_usage>).  `-rN` can be used to disable it (the old behavior).   - :issue:`6469`: New options have been added to the :confval:`junit_logging` option:``log`,`out-err`, and`all``.   - :issue:`6834`: Excess warning summaries are now collapsed per file to ensure readable display of warning summaries.    Improvements ------------  - :issue:`1857`:``pytest.mark.parametrize`accepts integers for`ids``again, converting it to strings.   - :issue:`449`: Use "yellow" main color with any XPASSED tests.   - :issue:`4639`: Revert "A warning is now issued when assertions are made for``None``".    The warning proved to be less useful than initially expected and had quite a   few false positive cases.   - :issue:`5686`:``tmpdir\_factory.mktemp``now fails when given absolute and non-normalized paths.   - :issue:`5984`: The``pytest\_warning\_captured`hook now receives a`location``parameter with the code location that generated the warning.   - :issue:`6213`: pytester: the``testdir`fixture respects environment settings from the`monkeypatch``fixture for inner runs.   - :issue:`6247`:``--fulltrace``is honored with collection errors.   - :issue:`6384`: Make `--showlocals` work also with `--tb=short`.   - :issue:`6653`: Add support for matching lines consecutively with `~pytest.LineMatcher`'s `~pytest.LineMatcher.fnmatch_lines` and `~pytest.LineMatcher.re_match_lines`.   - :issue:`6658`: Code is now highlighted in tracebacks when``pygments`is installed.    Users are encouraged to install`pygments`into their environment and provide feedback, because   the plan is to make`pygments``a regular dependency in the future.   - :issue:`6795`: Import usage error message with invalid `-o` option.   - :issue:`759`:``pytest.mark.parametrize`supports iterators and generators for`ids``.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`310`: Add support for calling `pytest.xfail()` and `pytest.importorskip()` with doctests.   - :issue:`3823`:``--trace``now works with unittests.   - :issue:`4445`: Fixed some warning reports produced by pytest to point to the correct location of the warning in the user's code.   - :issue:`5301`: Fix``--last-failed``to collect new tests from files with known failures.   - :issue:`5928`: Report``PytestUnknownMarkWarning`at the level of the user's code, not`pytest``'s.   - :issue:`5991`: Fix interaction with``--pdb`and unittests: do not use unittest's`TestCase.debug()``.   - :issue:`6334`: Fix summary entries appearing twice when``f/F`and`s/S`report chars were used at the same time in the`-r`command-line option (for example`-rFf``).    The upper case variants were never documented and the preferred form should be the lower case.   - :issue:`6409`: Fallback to green (instead of yellow) for non-last items without previous passes with colored terminal progress indicator.   - :issue:`6454`: `--disable-warnings` is honored with `-ra` and `-rA`.   - :issue:`6497`: Fix bug in the comparison of request key with cached key in fixture.    A construct``if key == cached\_key:`can fail either because`==`is explicitly disallowed, or for, e.g., NumPy arrays, where the result of`a == b``cannot generally be converted to `bool`.   The implemented fix replaces `==` with``is``.   - :issue:`6557`: Make capture output streams``.write()``method return the same return value from original streams.   - :issue:`6566`: Fix``EncodedFile.writelines`to call the underlying buffer's`writelines``method.   - :issue:`6575`: Fix internal crash when``faulthandler`starts initialized   (for example with`PYTHONFAULTHANDLER=1`environment variable set) and`faulthandler\_timeout``defined   in the configuration file.   - :issue:`6597`: Fix node ids which contain a parametrized empty-string variable.   - :issue:`6646`: Assertion rewriting hooks are (re)stored for the current item, which fixes them being still used after e.g. pytester's``testdir.runpytest``etc.   - :issue:`6660`: :py`pytest.exit` is handled when emitted from the :hook:`pytest_sessionfinish` hook.  This includes quitting from a debugger.   - :issue:`6752`: When :py`pytest.raises` is used as a function (as opposed to a context manager),   a `match` keyword argument is now passed through to the tested function. Previously   it was swallowed and ignored (regression in pytest 5.1.0).   - :issue:`6801`: Do not display empty lines in between traceback for unexpected exceptions with doctests.   - :issue:`6802`: The :fixture:`testdir fixture <testdir>` works within doctests now.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`6696`: Add list of fixtures to start of fixture chapter.   - :issue:`6742`: Expand first sentence on fixtures into a paragraph.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`6404`: Remove usage of``parser``module, deprecated in Python 3.9.   pytest 5.3.5 (2020-01-29) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6517`: Fix regression in pytest 5.3.4 causing an INTERNALERROR due to a wrong assertion.   pytest 5.3.4 (2020-01-20) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6496`: Revert :issue:`6436`: unfortunately this change has caused a number of regressions in many suites,   so the team decided to revert this change and make a new release while we continue to look for a solution.   pytest 5.3.3 (2020-01-16) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2780`: Captured output during teardown is shown with``-rP``.   - :issue:`5971`: Fix a``pytest-xdist`crash when dealing with exceptions raised in subprocesses created by the`multiprocessing``module.   - :issue:`6436`: `~pytest.FixtureDef` objects now properly register their finalizers with autouse and   parameterized fixtures that execute before them in the fixture stack so they are torn   down at the right times, and in the right order.   - :issue:`6532`: Fix parsing of outcomes containing multiple errors with``testdir``results (regression in 5.3.0).    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`6350`: Optimized automatic renaming of test parameter IDs.   pytest 5.3.2 (2019-12-13) =========================  Improvements ------------  - :issue:`4639`: Revert "A warning is now issued when assertions are made for``None``".    The warning proved to be less useful than initially expected and had quite a   few false positive cases.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5430`: junitxml: Logs for failed test are now passed to junit report in case the test fails during call phase.   - :issue:`6290`: The supporting files in the``.pytest\_cache`directory are kept with`--cache-clear``, which only clears cached values now.   - :issue:`6301`: Fix assertion rewriting for egg-based distributions and``editable`installs (`pip install --editable``).   pytest 5.3.1 (2019-11-25) =========================  Improvements ------------  - :issue:`6231`: Improve check for misspelling of [pytest.mark.parametrize ref](#pytest.mark.parametrize-ref).   - :issue:`6257`: Handle `pytest.exit` being used via :hook:`pytest_internalerror`, e.g. when quitting pdb from post mortem.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5914`: pytester: fix :py`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_fnmatch_line` when used after positive matching.   - :issue:`6082`: Fix line detection for doctest samples inside   :py`python:property` docstrings, as a workaround to   :issue:`python/cpython#61648`.   - :issue:`6254`: Fix compatibility with pytest-parallel (regression in pytest 5.3.0).   - :issue:`6255`: Clear the :py`sys.last_traceback`, :py`sys.last_type`   and :py`sys.last_value` attributes by deleting them instead   of setting them to``None``. This better matches the behaviour of   the Python standard library.   pytest 5.3.0 (2019-11-19) =========================  Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`6179`: The default value of :confval:`junit_family` option will change to``"xunit2"`in pytest 6.0, given   that this is the version supported by default in modern tools that manipulate this type of file.    In order to smooth the transition, pytest will issue a warning in case the`--junitxml``option   is given in the command line but :confval:`junit_family` is not explicitly configured in``pytest.ini``.    For more information, [see the docs <junit-family changed default value>](#see-the-docs-<junit-family-changed-default-value>).    Features --------  - :issue:`4488`: The pytest team has created the `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__   plugin, which provides a new``--report-log=FILE`option that writes *report logs* into a file as the test session executes.    Each line of the report log contains a self contained JSON object corresponding to a testing event,   such as a collection or a test result report. The file is guaranteed to be flushed after writing   each line, so systems can read and process events in real-time.    The plugin is meant to replace the`--resultlog`option, which is deprecated and meant to be removed   in a future release. If you use`--resultlog`, please try out`pytest-reportlog``and   provide feedback.   - :issue:`4730`: When :py`sys.pycache_prefix` (Python 3.8+) is set, it will be used by pytest to cache test files changed by the assertion rewriting mechanism.    This makes it easier to benefit of cached``.pyc``files even on file systems without permissions.   - :issue:`5515`: Allow selective auto-indentation of multiline log messages.    Adds command line option``--log-auto-indent``, config option   :confval:`log_auto_indent` and support for per-entry configuration of   indentation behavior on calls to :py`python:logging.log()`.    Alters the default for auto-indention from``"on"`to`"off"``. This   restores the older behavior that existed prior to v4.6.0. This   reversion to earlier behavior was done because it is better to   activate new features that may lead to broken tests explicitly   rather than implicitly.   - :issue:`5914`: :fixture:`testdir` learned two new functions, :py`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_fnmatch_line` and   :py`~pytest.LineMatcher.no_re_match_line`.    The functions are used to ensure the captured text *does not* match the given   pattern.    The previous idiom was to use :py`python:re.match`:``\`python result = testdir.runpytest() assert re.match(pat, result.stdout.str()) is None

> Or the `in` operator:
> 
> ``` python
> result = testdir.runpytest()
> assert text in result.stdout.str()
> ```
> 
> But the new functions produce best output on failure.

  - `6057`: Added tolerances to complex values when printing `pytest.approx`.
    
    For example, `repr(pytest.approx(3+4j))` returns `(3+4j) ± 5e-06 ∠ ±180°`. This is polar notation indicating a circle around the expected value, with a radius of 5e-06. For `approx` comparisons to return `True`, the actual value should fall within this circle.

  - `6061`: Added the pluginmanager as an argument to `pytest_addoption` so that hooks can be invoked when setting up command line options. This is useful for having one plugin communicate things to another plugin, such as default values or which set of command line options to add.

Improvements `` ` ------------  - :issue:`5061`: Use multiple colors with terminal summary statistics.   - :issue:`5630`: Quitting from debuggers is now properly handled in ``doctest``items.   - :issue:`5924`: Improved verbose diff output with sequences.    Before:    ::        E   AssertionError: assert ['version', '...version_info'] == ['version', '...version', ...]       E     Right contains 3 more items, first extra item: ' '       E     Full diff:       E     - ['version', 'version_info', 'sys.version', 'sys.version_info']       E     + ['version',       E     +  'version_info',       E     +  'sys.version',       E     +  'sys.version_info',       E     +  ' ',       E     +  'sys.version',       E     +  'sys.version_info']    After:    ::        E   AssertionError: assert ['version', '...version_info'] == ['version', '...version', ...]       E     Right contains 3 more items, first extra item: ' '       E     Full diff:       E       [       E        'version',       E        'version_info',       E        'sys.version',       E        'sys.version_info',       E     +  ' ',       E     +  'sys.version',       E     +  'sys.version_info',       E       ]   - :issue:`5934`:``repr`of`ExceptionInfo`objects has been improved to honor the`\_\_repr\_\_``method of the underlying exception.  - :issue:`5936`: Display untruncated assertion message with``-vv``.   - :issue:`5990`: Fixed plurality mismatch in test summary (e.g. display "1 error" instead of "1 errors").   - :issue:`6008`:``Config.InvocationParams.args`is now always a`tuple``to better convey that it should be   immutable and avoid accidental modifications.   - :issue:`6023`:``pytest.main`returns a`pytest.ExitCode`instance now, except for when custom exit codes are used (where it returns`int``then still).   - :issue:`6026`: Align prefixes in output of pytester's``LineMatcher``.   - :issue:`6059`: Collection errors are reported as errors (and not failures like before) in the terminal's short test summary.   - :issue:`6069`:``pytester.spawn``does not skip/xfail tests on FreeBSD anymore unconditionally.   - :issue:`6097`: The "[...%]" indicator in the test summary is now colored according to the final (new) multi-colored line's main color.   - :issue:`6116`: Added``--co`as a synonym to`--collect-only``.   - :issue:`6148`:``atomicwrites``is now only used on Windows, fixing a performance regression with assertion rewriting on Unix.   - :issue:`6152`: Now parametrization will use the``\_\_name\_\_`attribute of any object for the id, if present. Previously it would only use`\_\_name\_\_``for functions and classes.   - :issue:`6176`: Improved failure reporting with pytester's``Hookrecorder.assertoutcome``.   - :issue:`6181`: The reason for a stopped session, e.g. with``--maxfail`/`-x``, now gets reported in the test summary.   - :issue:`6206`: Improved``cache.set``robustness and performance.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2049`: Fixed``--setup-plan``showing inaccurate information about fixture lifetimes.   - :issue:`2548`: Fixed line offset mismatch of skipped tests in terminal summary.   - :issue:`6039`: The``PytestDoctestRunner`is now properly invalidated when unconfiguring the doctest plugin.    This is important when used with`pytester`'s`runpytest\_inprocess``.   - :issue:`6047`: BaseExceptions are now handled in``saferepr`, which includes`pytest.fail.Exception``etc.   - :issue:`6074`: pytester: fixed order of arguments in``rm\_rf`warning when cleaning up temporary directories, and do not emit warnings for errors with`os.open``.   - :issue:`6189`: Fixed result of``getmodpath``method.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4901`:``RunResult`from`pytester`now displays the mnemonic of the`ret`attribute when it is a   valid`pytest.ExitCode``value.   pytest 5.2.4 (2019-11-15) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6194`: Fix incorrect discovery of non-test``\_\_init\_\_.py``files.   - :issue:`6197`: Revert "The first test in a package (``\_\_init\_\_.py`) marked with`@pytest.mark.skip``is now correctly skipped.".   pytest 5.2.3 (2019-11-14) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5830`: The first test in a package (``\_\_init\_\_.py`) marked with`@pytest.mark.skip``is now correctly skipped.   - :issue:`6099`: Fix``--trace``when used with parametrized functions.   - :issue:`6183`: Using``request`as a parameter name in`@pytest.mark.parametrize``now produces a more   user-friendly error.   pytest 5.2.2 (2019-10-24) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5206`: Fix``--nf``to not forget about known nodeids with partial test selection.   - :issue:`5906`: Fix crash with``KeyboardInterrupt`during`--setup-show``.   - :issue:`5946`: Fixed issue when parametrizing fixtures with numpy arrays (and possibly other sequence-like types).   - :issue:`6044`: Properly ignore``FileNotFoundError`exceptions when trying to remove old temporary directories,   for instance when multiple processes try to remove the same directory (common with`pytest-xdist``for example).   pytest 5.2.1 (2019-10-06) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5902`: Fix warnings about deprecated``cmp`attribute in`attrs\>=19.2``.   pytest 5.2.0 (2019-09-28) =========================  Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`1682`: Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments is deprecated - pass them   as a keyword argument instead.    Features --------  - :issue:`1682`: The``scope`parameter of`@pytest.fixture`can now be a callable that receives   the fixture name and the`config``object as keyword-only parameters.   See [the docs <dynamic scope>](#the-docs-<dynamic-scope>) for more information.   - :issue:`5764`: New behavior of the``--pastebin``option: failures to connect to the pastebin server are reported, without failing the pytest run    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5806`: Fix "lexer" being used when uploading to bpaste.net from``--pastebin``to "text".   - :issue:`5884`: Fix``--setup-only`and`--setup-show``for custom pytest items.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`5056`: The HelpFormatter uses``py.io.get\_terminal\_width``for better width detection.   pytest 5.1.3 (2019-09-18) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5807`: Fix pypy3.6 (nightly) on windows.   - :issue:`5811`: Handle``--fulltrace`correctly with`pytest.raises``.   - :issue:`5819`: Windows: Fix regression with conftest whose qualified name contains uppercase   characters (introduced by #5792).   pytest 5.1.2 (2019-08-30) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2270`: Fixed``self`reference in function-scoped fixtures defined plugin classes: previously`self``would be a reference to a *test* class, not the *plugin* class.   - :issue:`570`: Fixed long standing issue where fixture scope was not respected when indirect fixtures were used during   parametrization.   - :issue:`5782`: Fix decoding error when printing an error response from``--pastebin``.   - :issue:`5786`: Chained exceptions in test and collection reports are now correctly serialized, allowing plugins like``pytest-xdist``to display them properly.   - :issue:`5792`: Windows: Fix error that occurs in certain circumstances when loading``conftest.py`from a working directory that has casing other than the one stored   in the filesystem (e.g.,`c:test`instead of`C:test``).   pytest 5.1.1 (2019-08-20) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5751`: Fixed``TypeError``when importing pytest on Python 3.5.0 and 3.5.1.   pytest 5.1.0 (2019-08-15) =========================  Removals --------  - :issue:`5180`: As per our policy, the following features have been deprecated in the 4.X series and are now   removed:    *``Request.getfuncargvalue`: use`Request.getfixturevalue`instead.    *`pytest.raises`and`pytest.warns`no longer support strings as the second argument.    *`message`parameter of`pytest.raises`.    *`pytest.raises`,`pytest.warns`and`ParameterSet.param`now use native keyword-only     syntax. This might change the exception message from previous versions, but they still raise`TypeError`on unknown keyword arguments as before.    *`pytest.config`global variable.    *`tmpdir\_factory.ensuretemp`method.    *`pytest\_logwarning`hook.    *`RemovedInPytest4Warning`warning type.    *`request``is now a reserved name for fixtures.     For more information consult :std[deprecations](deprecations.md) in the docs.   - :issue:`5565`: Removed unused support code for :pypi:`unittest2`.    The``unittest2`backport module is no longer   necessary since Python 3.3+, and the small amount of code in pytest to support it also doesn't seem   to be used: after removed, all tests still pass unchanged.    Although our policy is to introduce a deprecation period before removing any features or support   for third party libraries, because this code is apparently not used   at all (even if`unittest2``is used by a test suite executed by pytest), it was decided to   remove it in this release.    If you experience a regression because of this, please :issue:`file an issue <new>`.   - :issue:`5615`:``pytest.fail`,`pytest.xfail`and`pytest.skip`no longer support bytes for the message argument.    This was supported for Python 2 where it was tempting to use`"message"`instead of`u"message"`.    Python 3 code is unlikely to pass`bytes`to these functions. If you do,   please decode it to an`str``beforehand.    Features --------  - :issue:`5564`: New``Config.invocation\_args`attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to`pytest.main()``.   - :issue:`5576`: New [NUMBER <using doctest options>](#number-<using-doctest-options>)   option for doctests to ignore irrelevant differences in floating-point numbers.   Inspired by Sébastien Boisgérault's `numtest <https://github.com/boisgera/numtest>`__   extension for doctest.    Improvements ------------  - :issue:`5471`: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.   - :issue:`5707`: Time taken to run the test suite now includes a human-readable representation when it takes over   60 seconds, for example::        ===== 2 failed in 102.70s (0:01:42) =====    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4344`: Fix RuntimeError/StopIteration when trying to collect package with "__init__.py" only.   - :issue:`5115`: Warnings issued during``pytest\_configure``are explicitly not treated as errors, even if configured as such, because it otherwise completely breaks pytest.   - :issue:`5477`: The XML file produced by``--junitxml`now correctly contain a`\<testsuites\>``root element.   - :issue:`5524`: Fix issue where``tmp\_path`and`tmpdir`would not remove directories containing files marked as read-only,   which could lead to pytest crashing when executed a second time with the`--basetemp``option.   - :issue:`5537`: Replace``importlib\_metadata`backport with`importlib.metadata``from the   standard library on Python 3.8+.   - :issue:`5578`: Improve type checking for some exception-raising functions (``pytest.xfail`,`pytest.skip`, etc)   so they provide better error messages when users meant to use marks (for example`@pytest.xfail`instead of`@pytest.mark.xfail``).   - :issue:`5606`: Fixed internal error when test functions were patched with objects that cannot be compared   for truth values against others, like``numpy``arrays.   - :issue:`5634`:``pytest.exit`is now correctly handled in`unittest`cases.   This makes`unittest`cases handle`quit``from pytest's pdb correctly.   - :issue:`5650`: Improved output when parsing an ini configuration file fails.   - :issue:`5701`: Fix collection of``staticmethod`objects defined with`functools.partial``.   - :issue:`5734`: Skip async generator test functions, and update the warning message to refer to``async def``functions.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`5669`: Add docstring for``Testdir.copy\_example``.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`5095`: XML files of the``xunit2``family are now validated against the schema by pytest's own test suite   to avoid future regressions.   - :issue:`5516`: Cache node splitting function which can improve collection performance in very large test suites.   - :issue:`5603`: Simplified internal``SafeRepr``class and removed some dead code.   - :issue:`5664`: When invoking pytest's own testsuite with``PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1`,   the`test\_xfail\_handling``test no longer fails.   - :issue:`5684`: Replace manual handling of``OSError.errno`in the codebase by new`OSError`subclasses (`PermissionError`,`FileNotFoundError``, etc.).   pytest 5.0.1 (2019-07-04) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5479`: Improve quoting in``raises``match failure message.   - :issue:`5523`: Fixed using multiple short options together in the command-line (for example``-vs``) in Python 3.8+.   - :issue:`5547`:``--step-wise`now handles`xfail(strict=True)``markers properly.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`5517`: Improve "Declaring new hooks" section in chapter "Writing Plugins"   pytest 5.0.0 (2019-06-28) =========================  Important ---------  This release is a Python3.5+ only release.  For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html>`_.  Removals --------  - :issue:`1149`: Pytest no longer accepts prefixes of command-line arguments, for example   typing``pytest --doctest-mod`inplace of`--doctest-modules`.   This was previously allowed where the`ArgumentParser``thought it was unambiguous,   but this could be incorrect due to delayed parsing of options for plugins.   See for example issues :issue:`1149`,   :issue:`3413`, and   :issue:`4009`.   - :issue:`5402`: **PytestDeprecationWarning are now errors by default.**    Following our plan to remove deprecated features with as little disruption as   possible, all warnings of type``PytestDeprecationWarning`now generate errors   instead of warning messages.    **The affected features will be effectively removed in pytest 5.1**, so please consult the   :std[deprecations](deprecations.md) section in the docs for directions on how to update existing code.    In the pytest`5.0.X`series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop   gap measure by adding this to your`pytest.ini`file:`\`ini \[pytest\] filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.PytestDeprecationWarning

> But this will stop working when pytest `5.1` is released.
> 
> **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to `5402`.

  - `5412`: `ExceptionInfo` objects (returned by `pytest.raises`) now have the same `str` representation as `repr`, which avoids some confusion when users use `print(e)` to inspect the object.
    
    This means code like:
    
    ``` python
    with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
        ...
    assert "some message" in str(e)
    ```
    
    Needs to be changed to:
    
    ``` python
    with pytest.raises(SomeException) as e:
        ...
    assert "some message" in str(e.value)
    ```

Deprecations `` ` ------------  - :issue:`4488`: The removal of the ``--result-log``option and module has been postponed to (tentatively) pytest 6.0 as   the team has not yet got around to implement a good alternative for it.   - :issue:`466`: The``funcargnames`attribute has been an alias for`fixturenames``since   pytest 2.3, and is now deprecated in code too.    Features --------  - :issue:`3457`: New :hook:`pytest_assertion_pass`   hook, called with context information when an assertion *passes*.    This hook is still **experimental** so use it with caution.   - :issue:`5440`: The :mod:`faulthandler` standard library   module is now enabled by default to help users diagnose crashes in C modules.    This functionality was provided by integrating the external   `pytest-faulthandler <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler>`__ plugin into the core,   so users should remove that plugin from their requirements if used.    For more information see the docs: [faulthandler](#faulthandler).   - :issue:`5452`: When warnings are configured as errors, pytest warnings now appear as originating from``pytest.`instead of the internal`\_pytest.warning\_types.``module.   - :issue:`5125`:``Session.exitcode`values are now coded in`pytest.ExitCode`, an`IntEnum`. This makes the exit code available for consumer code and are more explicit other than just documentation. User defined exit codes are still valid, but should be used with caution.    The team doesn't expect this change to break test suites or plugins in general, except in esoteric/specific scenarios.    **pytest-xdist** users should upgrade to`1.29.0`or later, as`pytest-xdist``required a compatibility fix because of this change.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`1403`: Switch from``imp`to`importlib``.   - :issue:`1671`: The name of the``.pyc``files cached by the assertion writer now includes the pytest version   to avoid stale caches.   - :issue:`2761`: Honor :pep:`235` on case-insensitive file systems.   - :issue:`5078`: Test module is no longer double-imported when using``--pyargs``.   - :issue:`5260`: Improved comparison of byte strings.    When comparing bytes, the assertion message used to show the byte numeric value when showing the differences::            def test():       >       assert b'spam' == b'eggs'       E       AssertionError: assert b'spam' == b'eggs'       E         At index 0 diff: 115 != 101       E         Use -v to get the full diff    It now shows the actual ascii representation instead, which is often more useful::            def test():       >       assert b'spam' == b'eggs'       E       AssertionError: assert b'spam' == b'eggs'       E         At index 0 diff: b's' != b'e'       E         Use -v to get the full diff   - :issue:`5335`: Colorize level names when the level in the logging format is formatted using   '%(levelname).Xs' (truncated fixed width alignment), where X is an integer.   - :issue:`5354`: Fix``pytest.mark.parametrize``when the argvalues is an iterator.   - :issue:`5370`: Revert unrolling of``all()`to fix`NameError``on nested comprehensions.   - :issue:`5371`: Revert unrolling of``all()`to fix incorrect handling of generators with`if``.   - :issue:`5372`: Revert unrolling of``all()`to fix incorrect assertion when using`all()``in an expression.   - :issue:`5383`:``-q`has again an impact on the style of the collected items   (`--collect-only`) when`--log-cli-level``is used.   - :issue:`5389`: Fix regressions of :pr:`5063` for``importlib\_metadata.PathDistribution`which have their`files`attribute being`None``.   - :issue:`5390`: Fix regression where the``obj`attribute of`TestCase``items was no longer bound to methods.   - :issue:`5404`: Emit a warning when attempting to unwrap a broken object raises an exception,   for easier debugging (:issue:`5080`).   - :issue:`5432`: Prevent "already imported" warnings from assertion rewriter when invoking pytest in-process multiple times.   - :issue:`5433`: Fix assertion rewriting in packages (``\_\_init\_\_.py``).   - :issue:`5444`: Fix``--stepwise``mode when the first file passed on the command-line fails to collect.   - :issue:`5482`: Fix bug introduced in 4.6.0 causing collection errors when passing   more than 2 positional arguments to``pytest.mark.parametrize``.   - :issue:`5505`: Fix crash when discovery fails while using``-p no:terminal``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`5315`: Expand docs on mocking classes and dictionaries with``monkeypatch``.   - :issue:`5416`: Fix PytestUnknownMarkWarning in run/skip example.   pytest 4.6.11 (2020-06-04) ==========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6334`: Fix summary entries appearing twice when``f/F`and`s/S`report chars were used at the same time in the`-r`command-line option (for example`-rFf``).    The upper case variants were never documented and the preferred form should be the lower case.   - :issue:`7310`: Fix``UnboundLocalError: local variable 'letter' referenced before assignment`in`\_pytest.terminal.pytest\_report\_teststatus()`when plugins return report objects in an unconventional state.    This was making`pytest\_report\_teststatus()`skip   entering if-block branches that declare the`letter`variable.    The fix was to set the initial value of the`letter``before   the if-block cascade so that it always has a value.   pytest 4.6.10 (2020-05-08) ==========================  Features --------  - :issue:`6870`: New``Config.invocation\_args`attribute containing the unchanged arguments passed to`pytest.main()``.    Remark: while this is technically a new feature and according to our   `policy <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html#what-goes-into-4-6-x-releases>`_   it should not have been backported, we have opened an exception in this   particular case because it fixes a serious interaction with``pytest-xdist``,   so it can also be considered a bugfix.  Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`6404`: Remove usage of``parser``module, deprecated in Python 3.9.   pytest 4.6.9 (2020-01-04) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`6301`: Fix assertion rewriting for egg-based distributions and``editable`installs (`pip install --editable``).   pytest 4.6.8 (2019-12-19) =========================  Features --------  - :issue:`5471`: JUnit XML now includes a timestamp and hostname in the testsuite tag.

For more details, see our `Python 2.7 and 3.4 support plan <https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.0.x/py27-py34-deprecation.html>`_.   Features --------  - :issue:`4559`: Added the``junit\_log\_passing\_tests``ini value which can be used to enable or disable logging of passing test output in the Junit XML file.   - :issue:`4956`: pytester's``testdir.spawn`uses`tmpdir``as HOME/USERPROFILE directory.   - :issue:`5062`: Unroll calls to``all``to full for-loops with assertion rewriting for better failure messages, especially when using Generator Expressions.   - :issue:`5063`: Switch from``pkg\_resources`to`importlib-metadata``for entrypoint detection for improved performance and import time.   - :issue:`5091`: The output for ini options in``--help``has been improved.   - :issue:`5269`:``pytest.importorskip`includes the`ImportError`now in the default`reason``.   - :issue:`5311`: Captured logs that are output for each failing test are formatted using the   ColoredLevelFormatter.   - :issue:`5312`: Improved formatting of multiline log messages in Python 3.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2064`: The debugging plugin imports the wrapped``Pdb`class (`--pdbcls``) on-demand now.   - :issue:`4908`: The``pytest\_enter\_pdb`hook gets called with post-mortem (`--pdb``).   - :issue:`5036`: Fix issue where fixtures dependent on other parametrized fixtures would be erroneously parametrized.   - :issue:`5256`: Handle internal error due to a lone surrogate unicode character not being representable in Jython.   - :issue:`5257`: Ensure that``sys.stdout.mode`does not include`'b'``as it is a text stream.   - :issue:`5278`: Pytest's internal python plugin can be disabled using``-p no:python``again.   - :issue:`5286`: Fix issue with``disable\_test\_id\_escaping\_and\_forfeit\_all\_rights\_to\_community\_support``option not working when using a list of test IDs in parametrized tests.   - :issue:`5330`: Show the test module being collected when emitting``PytestCollectionWarning`messages for   test classes with`\_\_init\_\_`and`\_\_new\_\_``methods to make it easier to pin down the problem.   - :issue:`5333`: Fix regression in 4.5.0 with``--lf``not re-running all tests with known failures from non-selected tests.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`5250`: Expand docs on use of``setenv`and`delenv`with`monkeypatch``.   pytest 4.5.0 (2019-05-11) =========================  Features --------  - :issue:`4826`: A warning is now emitted when unknown marks are used as a decorator.   This is often due to a typo, which can lead to silently broken tests.   - :issue:`4907`: Show XFail reason as part of JUnitXML message field.   - :issue:`5013`: Messages from crash reports are displayed within test summaries now, truncated to the terminal width.   - :issue:`5023`: New flag``--strict-markers``that triggers an error when unknown markers (e.g. those not registered using the :confval:`markers` option in the configuration file) are used in the test suite.    The existing``--strict``option has the same behavior currently, but can be augmented in the future for additional checks.   - :issue:`5026`: Assertion failure messages for sequences and dicts contain the number of different items now.   - :issue:`5034`: Improve reporting with``--lf`and`--ff``(run-last-failure).   - :issue:`5035`: The``--cache-show``option/action accepts an optional glob to show only matching cache entries.   - :issue:`5059`: Standard input (stdin) can be given to pytester's``Testdir.run()`and`Testdir.popen()``.   - :issue:`5068`: The``-r`option learnt about`A``to display all reports (including passed ones) in the short test summary.   - :issue:`5108`: The short test summary is displayed after passes with output (``-rP``).   - :issue:`5172`: The``--last-failed`(`--lf``) option got smarter and will now skip entire files if all tests   of that test file have passed in previous runs, greatly speeding up collection.   - :issue:`5177`: Introduce new specific warning``PytestWarning`subclasses to make it easier to filter warnings based on the class, rather than on the message. The new subclasses are:     *`PytestAssertRewriteWarning`*`PytestCacheWarning`*`PytestCollectionWarning`*`PytestConfigWarning`*`PytestUnhandledCoroutineWarning`*`PytestUnknownMarkWarning``- :issue:`5202`: New``record\_testsuite\_property`session-scoped fixture allows users to log`\<property\>`tags at the`testsuite`level with the`junitxml`plugin.    The generated XML is compatible with the latest xunit standard, contrary to   the properties recorded by`record\_property`and`record\_xml\_attribute``.   - :issue:`5214`: The default logging format has been changed to improve readability. Here is an   example of a previous logging message::        test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py    3 CRITICAL critical message logged by test    This has now become::        CRITICAL root:test_log_cli_enabled_disabled.py:3 critical message logged by test    The formatting can be changed through the :confval:`log_format` configuration option.   - :issue:`5220`:``--fixtures`now also shows fixture scope for scopes other than`"function"``.

Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`4935`: Expand docs on registering marks and the effect of``--strict``.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4942`:``logging.raiseExceptions`is not set to`False``anymore.   - :issue:`5013`: pytest now depends on :pypi:`wcwidth` to properly track unicode character sizes for more precise terminal output.   - :issue:`5059`: pytester's``Testdir.popen()`uses`stdout`and`stderr`via keyword arguments with defaults now (`subprocess.PIPE``).   - :issue:`5069`: The code for the short test summary in the terminal was moved to the terminal plugin.   - :issue:`5082`: Improved validation of kwargs for various methods in the pytester plugin.   - :issue:`5202`:``record\_property`now emits a`PytestWarning`when used with`junit\_family=xunit2`: the fixture generates`property`tags as children of`testcase``, which is not permitted according to the most   `recent schema <https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/master/   src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd>`__.   - :issue:`5239`: Pin``pluggy`to`\< 1.0`so we don't update to`1.0`automatically when   it gets released: there are planned breaking changes, and we want to ensure   pytest properly supports`pluggy 1.0``.   pytest 4.4.2 (2019-05-08) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`5089`: Fix crash caused by error in``\_\_repr\_\_`function with both`showlocals``and verbose output enabled.   - :issue:`5139`: Eliminate core dependency on 'terminal' plugin.   - :issue:`5229`: Require``pluggy\>=0.11.0`which reverts a dependency to`importlib-metadata`added in`0.10.0`.   The`importlib-metadata`package cannot be imported when installed as an egg and causes issues when relying on`setup.py``to install test dependencies.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`5171`: Doc:``pytest\_ignore\_collect`,`pytest\_collect\_directory`,`pytest\_collect\_file`and`pytest\_pycollect\_makemodule`hooks's 'path' parameter documented type is now`py.path.local``- :issue:`5188`: Improve help for``--runxfail``flag.

Previously`async``functions would not execute at all but still be marked as "passed".   - :issue:`2482`: Include new``disable\_test\_id\_escaping\_and\_forfeit\_all\_rights\_to\_community\_support``option to disable ascii-escaping in parametrized values. This may cause a series of problems and as the name makes clear, use at your own risk.   - :issue:`4718`: The``-p`option can now be used to early-load plugins also by entry-point name, instead of just   by module name.    This makes it possible to early load external plugins like`pytest-cov``in the command-line::        pytest -p pytest_cov   - :issue:`4855`: The``--pdbcls`option handles classes via module attributes now (e.g.`pdb:pdb.Pdb``with :pypi:`pdbpp`), and its validation was improved.   - :issue:`4875`: The :confval:`testpaths` configuration option is now displayed next   to the``rootdir`and`inifile`lines in the pytest header if the option is in effect, i.e., directories or file names were   not explicitly passed in the command line.    Also,`inifile`is only displayed if there's a configuration file, instead of an empty`inifile:``string.   - :issue:`4911`: Doctests can be skipped now dynamically using``pytest.skip()``.   - :issue:`4920`: Internal refactorings have been made in order to make the implementation of the   `pytest-subtests <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests>`__ plugin   possible, which adds unittest sub-test support and a new``subtests``fixture as discussed in   :issue:`1367`.    For details on the internal refactorings, please see the details on the related PR.   - :issue:`4931`: pytester's``LineMatcher``asserts that the passed lines are a sequence.   - :issue:`4936`: Handle``-p plug`after`-p no:plug``.    This can be used to override a blocked plugin (e.g. in "addopts") from the   command line etc.   - :issue:`4951`: Output capturing is handled correctly when only capturing via fixtures (capsys, capfs) with``pdb.set\_trace()``.   - :issue:`4956`:``pytester`sets`$HOME`and`$USERPROFILE``to the temporary directory during test runs.    This ensures to not load configuration files from the real user's home directory.   - :issue:`4980`: Namespace packages are handled better with``monkeypatch.syspath\_prepend`and`testdir.syspathinsert`(via`pkg\_resources.fixup\_namespace\_packages``).   - :issue:`4993`: The stepwise plugin reports status information now.   - :issue:`5008`: If a``setup.cfg`file contains`\[<tool:pytest>\]`and also the no longer supported`\[pytest\]`section, pytest will use`\[<tool:pytest>\]`ignoring`\[pytest\]``. Previously it would unconditionally error out.    This makes it simpler for plugins to support old pytest versions.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`1895`: Fix bug where fixtures requested dynamically via``request.getfixturevalue()``might be teardown   before the requesting fixture.   - :issue:`4851`: pytester unsets``PYTEST\_ADDOPTS`now to not use outer options with`testdir.runpytest()``.   - :issue:`4903`: Use the correct modified time for years after 2038 in rewritten``.pyc``files.   - :issue:`4928`: Fix line offsets with``ScopeMismatch``errors.   - :issue:`4957`:``-p no:plugin`is handled correctly for default (internal) plugins now, e.g. with`-p no:capture`.    Previously they were loaded (imported) always, making e.g. the`capfd``fixture available.   - :issue:`4968`: The pdb``quit`command is handled properly when used after the`debug``command with :pypi:`pdbpp`.   - :issue:`4975`: Fix the interpretation of``-qq`option where it was being considered as`-v``instead.   - :issue:`4978`:``outcomes.Exit`is not swallowed in`assertrepr\_compare``anymore.   - :issue:`4988`: Close logging's file handler explicitly when the session finishes.   - :issue:`5003`: Fix line offset with mark collection error (off by one).    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`4974`: Update docs for``pytest\_cmdline\_parse``hook to note availability limitations    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4718`:``pluggy\>=0.9``is now required.   - :issue:`4815`:``funcsigs\>=1.0``is now required for Python 2.7.   - :issue:`4829`: Some left-over internal code related to``yield``tests has been removed.   - :issue:`4890`: Remove internally unused``anypython``fixture from the pytester plugin.   - :issue:`4912`: Remove deprecated Sphinx directive,``add\_description\_unit()``,   pin sphinx-removed-in to >= 0.2.0 to support Sphinx 2.0.   - :issue:`4913`: Fix pytest tests invocation with custom``PYTHONPATH``.   - :issue:`4965`: New``pytest\_report\_to\_serializable`and`pytest\_report\_from\_serializable`**experimental** hooks.    These hooks will be used by`pytest-xdist`,`pytest-subtests``, and the replacement for   resultlog to serialize and customize reports.    They are experimental, meaning that their details might change or even be removed   completely in future patch releases without warning.    Feedback is welcome from plugin authors and users alike.   - :issue:`4987`:``Collector.repr\_failure`respects the`--tb`option, but only defaults to`short`now (with`auto``).   pytest 4.3.1 (2019-03-11) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4810`: Logging messages inside``pytest\_runtest\_logreport()``are now properly captured and displayed.   - :issue:`4861`: Improve validation of contents written to captured output so it behaves the same as when capture is disabled.   - :issue:`4898`: Fix``AttributeError: FixtureRequest has no 'confg' attribute`bug in`testdir.copy\_example``.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4768`: Avoid pkg_resources import at the top-level.   pytest 4.3.0 (2019-02-16) =========================  Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`4724`:``pytest.warns()``now emits a warning when it receives unknown keyword arguments.    This will be changed into an error in the future.    Features --------  - :issue:`2753`: Usage errors from argparse are mapped to pytest's``UsageError``.   - :issue:`3711`: Add the``--ignore-glob``parameter to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.   Add the :globalvar:`collect_ignore_glob` for``conftest.py``to exclude test-modules with Unix shell-style wildcards.   - :issue:`4698`: The warning about Python 2.7 and 3.4 not being supported in pytest 5.0 has been removed.    In the end it was considered to be more   of a nuisance than actual utility and users of those Python versions shouldn't have problems as``pip``will not   install pytest 5.0 on those interpreters.   - :issue:`4707`: With the help of new``set\_log\_path()`method there is a way to set`log\_file``paths from hooks.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4651`:``--help`and`--version`are handled with`UsageError``.   - :issue:`4782`: Fix``AssertionError``with collection of broken symlinks with packages.   pytest 4.2.1 (2019-02-12) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2895`: The``pytest\_report\_collectionfinish`hook now is also called with`--collect-only``.   - :issue:`3899`: Do not raise``UsageError`when an imported package has a`pytest\_plugins.py``child module.   - :issue:`4347`: Fix output capturing when using pdb++ with recursive debugging.   - :issue:`4592`: Fix handling of``collect\_ignore`via parent`conftest.py``.   - :issue:`4700`: Fix regression where``setUpClass`would always be called in subclasses even if all tests   were skipped by a`unittest.skip()``decorator applied in the subclass.   - :issue:`4739`: Fix``parametrize(... ids=\<function\>)``when the function returns non-strings.   - :issue:`4745`: Fix/improve collection of args when passing in``\_\_init\_\_.py``and a test file.   - :issue:`4770`:``more\_itertools``is now constrained to <6.0.0 when required for Python 2.7 compatibility.   - :issue:`526`: Fix "ValueError: Plugin already registered" exceptions when running in build directories that symlink to actual source.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3899`: Add note to``plugins.rst`that`pytest\_plugins``should not be used as a name for a user module containing plugins.   - :issue:`4324`: Document how to use``raises`and`does\_not\_raise``to write parametrized tests with conditional raises.   - :issue:`4709`: Document how to customize test failure messages when using``pytest.warns``.

This fixes a number of surprising issues like``setup\_method``being called before session-scoped   autouse fixtures (see :issue:`517` for an example).   - :issue:`4627`: Display a message at the end of the test session when running under Python 2.7 and 3.4 that pytest 5.0 will no longer   support those Python versions.   - :issue:`4660`: The number of *selected* tests now are also displayed when the``-k`or`-m``flags are used.   - :issue:`4688`:``pytest\_report\_teststatus`hook now can also receive a`config``parameter.   - :issue:`4691`:``pytest\_terminal\_summary`hook now can also receive a`config``parameter.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3547`:``--junitxml`can emit XML compatible with Jenkins xUnit.`junit\_family`INI option accepts`legacy|xunit1`, which produces old style output, and`xunit2``that conforms more strictly to https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd   - :issue:`4280`: Improve quitting from pdb, especially with``--trace`.    Using`q\[quit\]`after`pdb.set\_trace()``will quit pytest also.   - :issue:`4402`: Warning summary now groups warnings by message instead of by test id.    This makes the output more compact and better conveys the general idea of how much code is   actually generating warnings, instead of how many tests call that code.   - :issue:`4536`:``monkeypatch.delattr`handles class descriptors like`staticmethod`/`classmethod``.   - :issue:`4649`: Restore marks being considered keywords for keyword expressions.   - :issue:`4653`:``tmp\_path``fixture and other related ones provides resolved path (a.k.a real path)   - :issue:`4667`:``pytest\_terminal\_summary`uses result from`pytest\_report\_teststatus``hook, rather than hardcoded strings.   - :issue:`4669`: Correctly handle``unittest.SkipTest``exception containing non-ascii characters on Python 2.   - :issue:`4680`: Ensure the``tmpdir`and the`tmp\_path``fixtures are the same folder.   - :issue:`4681`: Ensure``tmp\_path``is always a real path.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4643`: Use``a.item()`instead of the deprecated`np.asscalar(a)`in`pytest.approx`.`np.asscalar`has been [deprecated <numpy:release/1.16.0-notes>](deprecated <numpy:release/1.16.0-notes>.md) in`numpy 1.16.``.   - :issue:`4657`: Copy saferepr from pylib   - :issue:`4668`: The verbose word for expected failures in the teststatus report changes from``xfail`to`XFAIL``to be consistent with other test outcomes.   pytest 4.1.1 (2019-01-12) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2256`: Show full repr with``assert a==b`and`-vv``.   - :issue:`3456`: Extend Doctest-modules to ignore mock objects.   - :issue:`4617`: Fixed``pytest.warns``bug when context manager is reused (e.g. multiple parametrization).   - :issue:`4631`: Don't rewrite assertion when``\_\_getattr\_\_``is broken    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3375`: Document that using``setup.cfg`may crash other tools or cause hard to track down problems because it uses a different parser than`pytest.ini`or`tox.ini``files.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4602`: Uninstall``hypothesis``in regen tox env.   pytest 4.1.0 (2019-01-05) =========================  Removals --------  - :issue:`2169`:``pytest.mark.parametrize``: in previous versions, errors raised by id functions were suppressed and changed into warnings. Now the exceptions are propagated, along with a pytest message informing the node, parameter value and index where the exception occurred.   - :issue:`3078`: Remove legacy internal warnings system:``config.warn`,`Node.warn`. The`pytest\_logwarning``now issues a warning when implemented.    See our [docs <config.warn and node.warn deprecated>](#docs-<config.warn-and-node.warn-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`3079`: Removed support for yield tests - they are fundamentally broken because they don't support fixtures properly since collection and test execution were separated.    See our [docs <yield tests deprecated>](#docs-<yield-tests-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`3082`: Removed support for applying marks directly to values in``@pytest.mark.parametrize`. Use`pytest.param``instead.    See our [docs <marks in pytest.parametrize deprecated>](#docs-<marks-in-pytest.parametrize-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`3083`: Removed``Metafunc.addcall`. This was the predecessor mechanism to`@pytest.mark.parametrize``.    See our [docs <metafunc.addcall deprecated>](#docs-<metafunc.addcall-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`3085`: Removed support for passing strings to``pytest.main``. Now, always pass a list of strings instead.    See our [docs <passing command-line string to pytest.main deprecated>](#docs-<passing-command-line-string-to-pytest.main-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`3086`:``\[pytest\]`section in **setup.cfg** files is no longer supported, use`\[<tool:pytest>\]`instead.`setup.cfg`files   are meant for use with`distutils`, and a section named`pytest`has notoriously been a source of conflicts and bugs.    Note that for **pytest.ini** and **tox.ini** files the section remains`\[pytest\]``.   - :issue:`3616`: Removed the deprecated compat properties for``node.Class/Function/Module`- use`pytest.Class/Function/Module``now.    See our [docs <internal classes accessed through node deprecated>](#docs-<internal-classes-accessed-through-node-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`4421`: Removed the implementation of the``pytest\_namespace``hook.    See our [docs <pytest.namespace deprecated>](#docs-<pytest.namespace-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`4489`: Removed``request.cached\_setup``. This was the predecessor mechanism to modern fixtures.    See our [docs <cached_setup deprecated>](#docs-<cached_setup-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`4535`: Removed the deprecated``PyCollector.makeitem``method. This method was made public by mistake a long time ago.   - :issue:`4543`: Removed support to define fixtures using the``pytest\_funcarg\_\_`prefix. Use the`@pytest.fixture``decorator instead.    See our [docs <pytest_funcarg__ prefix deprecated>](#docs-<pytest_funcarg__-prefix-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`4545`: Calling fixtures directly is now always an error instead of a warning.    See our [docs <calling fixtures directly deprecated>](#docs-<calling-fixtures-directly-deprecated>) on information on how to update your code.   - :issue:`4546`: Remove``Node.get\_marker(name)`the return value was not usable for more than an existence check.    Use`Node.get\_closest\_marker(name)``as a replacement.   - :issue:`4547`: The deprecated``record\_xml\_property`fixture has been removed, use the more generic`record\_property``instead.    See our [docs <record_xml_property deprecated>](#docs-<record_xml_property-deprecated>) for more information.   - :issue:`4548`: An error is now raised if the``pytest\_plugins`variable is defined in a non-top-level`conftest.py`file (i.e., not residing in the`rootdir``).    See our [docs <pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files deprecated>](#docs-<pytest_plugins-in-non-top-level-conftest-files-deprecated>) for more information.   - :issue:`891`: Remove``testfunction.markername`attributes - use`Node.iter\_markers(name=None)``to iterate them.    Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`3050`: Deprecated the``pytest.config``global.    See [pytest.config global deprecated](#pytest.config-global-deprecated) for rationale.   - :issue:`3974`: Passing the``message`parameter of`pytest.raises`now issues a`DeprecationWarning`.    It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact   it only serves to provide a custom message in case the`pytest.raises``check fails. To avoid this   mistake and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing   an alternative for the moment.    If you have concerns about this, please comment on :issue:`3974`.   - :issue:`4435`: Deprecated``raises(..., 'code(as\_a\_string)')`and`warns(..., 'code(as\_a\_string)')``.    See :std[raises-warns-exec](#raises-warns-exec) for rationale and examples.    Features --------  - :issue:`3191`: A warning is now issued when assertions are made for``None`.    This is a common source of confusion among new users, which write:`\`python assert mocked\_object.assert\_called\_with(3, 4, 5, key="value")

> When they should write:
> 
> ``` python
> mocked_object.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key="value")
> ```
> 
> Because the `assert_called_with` method of mock objects already executes an assertion.
> 
> This warning will not be issued when `None` is explicitly checked. An assertion like:
> 
> ``` python
> assert variable is None
> ```
> 
> will not issue the warning.

  - `3632`: Richer equality comparison introspection on `AssertionError` for objects created using [attrs](https://www.attrs.org/en/stable/) or `dataclasses` (Python 3.7+, `backported to 3.6 <dataclasses>`).

  - `4278`: `CACHEDIR.TAG` files are now created inside cache directories.
    
    Those files are part of the [Cache Directory Tagging Standard](https://bford.info/cachedir/spec.html), and can be used by backup or synchronization programs to identify pytest's cache directory as such.

  - `4292`: `pytest.outcomes.Exit` is derived from `SystemExit` instead of `KeyboardInterrupt`. This allows us to better handle `pdb` exiting.

  - `4371`: Updated the `--collect-only` option to display test descriptions when ran using `--verbose`.

  - `4386`: Restructured `ExceptionInfo` object construction and ensure incomplete instances have a `repr`/`str`.

  - `4416`: pdb: added support for keyword arguments with `pdb.set_trace`.
    
    It handles `header` similar to Python 3.7 does it, and forwards any other keyword arguments to the `Pdb` constructor.
    
    This allows for `__import__("pdb").set_trace(skip=["foo.*"])`.

  - `4483`: Added ini parameter `junit_duration_report` to optionally report test call durations, excluding setup and teardown times.
    
    The JUnit XML specification and the default pytest behavior is to include setup and teardown times in the test duration report. You can include just the call durations instead (excluding setup and teardown) by adding this to your `pytest.ini` file:
    
    ``` ini
    [pytest]
    junit_duration_report = call
    ```

  - `4532`: `-ra` now will show errors and failures last, instead of as the first items in the summary.
    
    This makes it easier to obtain a list of errors and failures to run tests selectively.

  - `4599`: `pytest.importorskip` now supports a `reason` parameter, which will be shown when the requested module cannot be imported.

Bug Fixes `` ` ---------  - :issue:`3532`: ``-p`now accepts its argument without a space between the value, for example`-pmyplugin``.   - :issue:`4327`:``approx`again works with more generic containers, more precisely instances of`Iterable`and`Sized`instead of more restrictive`Sequence``.   - :issue:`4397`: Ensure that node ids are printable.   - :issue:`4435`: Fixed``raises(..., 'code(string)')``frame filename.   - :issue:`4458`: Display actual test ids in``--collect-only``.

In the pytest`4.0.X`series, it is possible to change the errors back into warnings as a stop   gap measure by adding this to your`pytest.ini`file:`\`ini \[pytest\] filterwarnings = ignore::pytest.RemovedInPytest4Warning

> But this will stop working when pytest `4.1` is released.
> 
> **If you have concerns** about the removal of a specific feature, please add a comment to `4348`.

  - `4358`: Remove the `::()` notation to denote a test class instance in node ids.
    
    Previously, node ids that contain test instances would use `::()` to denote the instance like this:
    
        test_foo.py::Test::()::test_bar
    
    The extra `::()` was puzzling to most users and has been removed, so that the test id becomes now:
    
        test_foo.py::Test::test_bar
    
    This change could not accompany a deprecation period as is usual when user-facing functionality changes because it was not really possible to detect when the functionality was being used explicitly.
    
    The extra `::()` might have been removed in some places internally already, which then led to confusion in places where it was expected, e.g. with `--deselect` (`4127`).
    
    Test class instances are also not listed with `--collect-only` anymore.

Features `` ` --------  - :issue:`4270`: The ``cache\_dir`option uses`$TOX\_ENV\_DIR``as prefix (if set in the environment).    This uses a different cache per tox environment by default.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3554`: Fix``CallInfo.\_\_repr\_\_``for when the call is not finished yet.   pytest 3.10.1 (2018-11-11) ==========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4287`: Fix nested usage of debugging plugin (pdb), e.g. with pytester's``testdir.runpytest``.   - :issue:`4304`: Block the``stepwise`plugin if`cacheprovider``is also blocked, as one depends on the other.   - :issue:`4306`: Parse``minversion``as an actual version and not as dot-separated strings.   - :issue:`4310`: Fix duplicate collection due to multiple args matching the same packages.   - :issue:`4321`: Fix``item.nodeid``with resolved symlinks.   - :issue:`4325`: Fix collection of direct symlinked files, where the target does not match``python\_files``.   - :issue:`4329`: Fix TypeError in report_collect with _collect_report_last_write.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4305`: Replace byte/unicode helpers in test_capture with python level syntax.   pytest 3.10.0 (2018-11-03) ==========================  Features --------  - :issue:`2619`: Resume capturing output after``continue`with`\_\_import\_\_("pdb").set\_trace()`.    This also adds a new`pytest\_leave\_pdb`hook, and passes in`pdb`to the   existing`pytest\_enter\_pdb``hook.   - :issue:`4147`: Add``--sw`,`--stepwise`as an alternative to`--lf -x``for stopping at the first failure, but starting the next test invocation from that test.  See [the documentation <cache stepwise>](#the-documentation-<cache-stepwise>) for more info.   - :issue:`4188`: Make``--color`emit colorful dots when not running in verbose mode. Earlier, it would only colorize the test-by-test output if`--verbose``was also passed.   - :issue:`4225`: Improve performance with collection reporting in non-quiet mode with terminals.    The "collecting …" message is only printed/updated every 0.5s.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2701`: Fix false``RemovedInPytest4Warning: usage of Session... is deprecated, please use pytest``warnings.   - :issue:`4046`: Fix problems with running tests in package``\_\_init\_\_.py``files.   - :issue:`4260`: Swallow warnings during anonymous compilation of source.   - :issue:`4262`: Fix access denied error when deleting stale directories created by``tmpdir`/`tmp\_path``.   - :issue:`611`: Naming a fixture``request`will now raise a warning: the`request``fixture is internal and   should not be overwritten as it will lead to internal errors.  - :issue:`4266`: Handle (ignore) exceptions raised during collection, e.g. with Django's LazySettings proxy class.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`4255`: Added missing documentation about the fact that module names passed to filter warnings are not regex-escaped.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4272`: Display cachedir also in non-verbose mode if non-default.   - :issue:`4277`: pdb: improve message about output capturing with``set\_trace`.    Do not display "IO-capturing turned off/on" when`-s``is used to avoid   confusion.   - :issue:`4279`: Improve message and stack level of warnings issued by``monkeypatch.setenv`when the value of the environment variable is not a`str``.   pytest 3.9.3 (2018-10-27) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`4174`: Fix "ValueError: Plugin already registered" with conftest plugins via symlink.   - :issue:`4181`: Handle race condition between creation and deletion of temporary folders.   - :issue:`4221`: Fix bug where the warning summary at the end of the test session was not showing the test where the warning was originated.   - :issue:`4243`: Fix regression when``stacklevel``for warnings was passed as positional argument on python2.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3851`: Add reference to``empty\_parameter\_set\_mark`ini option in documentation of`@pytest.mark.parametrize``Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`4028`: Revert patching of``sys.breakpointhook``since it appears to do nothing.   - :issue:`4233`: Apply an import sorter (``reorder-python-imports``) to the codebase.   - :issue:`4248`: Remove use of unnecessary compat shim, six.binary_type   pytest 3.9.2 (2018-10-22) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2909`: Improve error message when a recursive dependency between fixtures is detected.   - :issue:`3340`: Fix logging messages not shown in hooks``pytest\_sessionstart()`and`pytest\_sessionfinish()``.   - :issue:`3533`: Fix unescaped XML raw objects in JUnit report for skipped tests   - :issue:`3691`: Python 2: safely format warning message about passing unicode strings to``warnings.warn`, which may cause   surprising`MemoryError`exception when monkey patching`warnings.warn``itself.   - :issue:`4026`: Improve error message when it is not possible to determine a function's signature.   - :issue:`4177`: Pin``setuptools\>=40.0`to support`py\_modules`in`setup.cfg``- :issue:`4179`: Restore the tmpdir behaviour of symlinking the current test run.   - :issue:`4192`: Fix filename reported by``warnings.warn`when using`recwarn``under python2.   pytest 3.9.1 (2018-10-16) =========================  Features --------  - :issue:`4159`: For test-suites containing test classes, the information about the subclassed   module is now output only if a higher verbosity level is specified (at least   "-vv").   pytest 3.9.0 (2018-10-15 - not published due to a release automation bug) =========================================================================  Deprecations ------------  - :issue:`3616`: The following accesses have been documented as deprecated for years, but are now actually emitting deprecation warnings.    * Access of``Module`,`Function`,`Class`,`Instance`,`File`and`Item`through`Node`instances. Now     users will th> **Warning** >            usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead      Users should just`import pytest`and access those objects using the`pytest`module.    *`request.cached\_setup`, this was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures. You can     consult :std[funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>](funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>.md).    * Using objects named`"Class"`as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in`Collector`subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use`pytest\_collect\_make\_item`to customize node types during     collection.      This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning     message please contact the authors so they can change the code.    * The warning that produces the message below has changed to`RemovedInPytest4Warning``::            getfuncargvalue is deprecated, use getfixturevalue   - :issue:`3988`: Add a Deprecation warning for pytest.ensuretemp as it was deprecated since a while.    Features --------  - :issue:`2293`: Improve usage errors messages by hiding internal details which can be distracting and noisy.    This has the side effect that some error conditions that previously raised generic errors (such as``ValueError`for unregistered marks) are now raising`Failed``exceptions.   - :issue:`3332`: Improve the error displayed when a``conftest.py`file could not be imported.    In order to implement this, a new`chain`parameter was added to`ExceptionInfo.getrepr`to show or hide chained tracebacks in Python 3 (defaults to`True``).   - :issue:`3849`: Add``empty\_parameter\_set\_mark=fail\_at\_collect``ini option for raising an exception when parametrize collects an empty set.   - :issue:`3964`: Log messages generated in the collection phase are shown when   live-logging is enabled and/or when they are logged to a file.   - :issue:`3985`: Introduce``tmp\_path`as a fixture providing a Path object. Also introduce`tmp\_path\_factory``as   a session-scoped fixture for creating arbitrary temporary directories from any other fixture or test.   - :issue:`4013`: Deprecation warnings are now shown even if you customize the warnings filters yourself. In the previous version   any customization would override pytest's filters and deprecation warnings would fall back to being hidden by default.   - :issue:`4073`: Allow specification of timeout for``Testdir.runpytest\_subprocess()`and`Testdir.run()``.   - :issue:`4098`: Add returncode argument to pytest.exit() to exit pytest with a specific return code.   - :issue:`4102`: Reimplement``pytest.deprecated\_call`using`pytest.warns`so it supports the`match='...'`keyword argument.    This has the side effect that`pytest.deprecated\_call`now raises`pytest.fail.Exception`instead   of`AssertionError``.   - :issue:`4149`: Require setuptools>=30.3 and move most of the metadata to``setup.cfg``.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2535`: Improve error message when test functions of``unittest.TestCase``subclasses use a parametrized fixture.   - :issue:`3057`:``request.fixturenames`now correctly returns the name of fixtures created by`request.getfixturevalue()``.   - :issue:`3946`: Warning filters passed as command line options using``-W`now take precedence over filters defined in`ini``configuration files.   - :issue:`4066`: Fix source reindenting by using``textwrap.dedent``directly.   - :issue:`4102`:``pytest.warn``will capture previously-warned warnings in Python 2. Previously they were never raised.   - :issue:`4108`: Resolve symbolic links for args.    This fixes running``pytest tests/test\_foo.py::test\_bar`, where`tests`is a symlink to`project/app/tests`:   previously`project/app/conftest.py``would be ignored for fixtures then.   - :issue:`4132`: Fix duplicate printing of internal errors when using``--pdb``.   - :issue:`4135`: pathlib based tmpdir cleanup now correctly handles symlinks in the folder.   - :issue:`4152`: Display the filename when encountering``SyntaxWarning``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3713`: Update usefixtures documentation to clarify that it can't be used with fixture functions.   - :issue:`4058`: Update fixture documentation to specify that a fixture can be invoked twice in the scope it's defined for.   - :issue:`4064`: According to unittest.rst, setUpModule and tearDownModule were not implemented, but it turns out they are. So updated the documentation for unittest.   - :issue:`4151`: Add tempir testing example to CONTRIBUTING.rst guide    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`2293`: The internal``MarkerError``exception has been removed.   - :issue:`3988`: Port the implementation of tmpdir to pathlib.   - :issue:`4063`: Exclude 0.00 second entries from``--duration`output unless`-vv``is passed on the command-line.   - :issue:`4093`: Fixed formatting of string literals in internal tests.   pytest 3.8.2 (2018-10-02) =========================  Deprecations and Removals -------------------------  - :issue:`4036`: The``item`parameter of`pytest\_warning\_captured`hook is now documented as deprecated. We realized only after   the`3.8`release that this parameter is incompatible with`pytest-xdist`.    Our policy is to not deprecate features during bug-fix releases, but in this case we believe it makes sense as we are   only documenting it as deprecated, without issuing warnings which might potentially break test suites. This will get   the word out that hook implementers should not use this parameter at all.    In a future release`item`will always be`None``and will emit a proper warning when a hook implementation   makes use of it.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3539`: Fix reload on assertion rewritten modules.   - :issue:`4034`: The``.user\_properties`attribute of`TestReport``objects is a list   of (name, value) tuples, but could sometimes be instantiated as a tuple   of tuples.  It is now always a list.   - :issue:`4039`: No longer issue warnings about using``pytest\_plugins`in non-top-level directories when using`--pyargs`: the   current`--pyargs``mechanism is not reliable and might give false negatives.   - :issue:`4040`: Exclude empty reports for passed tests when``-rP``option is used.   - :issue:`4051`: Improve error message when an invalid Python expression is passed to the``-m``option.   - :issue:`4056`:``MonkeyPatch.setenv`and`MonkeyPatch.delenv`issue a warning if the environment variable name is not`str`on Python 2.    In Python 2, adding`unicode`keys to`os.environ`causes problems with`subprocess`(and possible other modules),   making this a subtle bug specially susceptible when used with`from \_\_future\_\_ import unicode\_literals``.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3928`: Add possible values for fixture scope to docs.   pytest 3.8.1 (2018-09-22) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3286`:``.pytest\_cache``directory is now automatically ignored by Git. Users who would like to contribute a solution for other SCMs please consult/comment on this issue.   - :issue:`3749`: Fix the following error during collection of tests inside packages::        TypeError: object of type 'Package' has no len()   - :issue:`3941`: Fix bug where indirect parametrization would consider the scope of all fixtures used by the test function to determine the parametrization scope, and not only the scope of the fixtures being parametrized.   - :issue:`3973`: Fix crash of the assertion rewriter if a test changed the current working directory without restoring it afterwards.   - :issue:`3998`: Fix issue that prevented some caplog properties (for example``record\_tuples`) from being available when entering the debugger with`--pdb``.   - :issue:`3999`: Fix``UnicodeDecodeError`in python2.x when a class returns a non-ascii binary`\_\_repr\_\_``in an assertion which also contains non-ascii text.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3996`: New :std[deprecations](deprecations.md) page shows all currently   deprecated features, the rationale to do so, and alternatives to update your code. It also list features removed   from pytest in past major releases to help those with ancient pytest versions to upgrade.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`3955`: Improve pre-commit detection for changelog filenames   - :issue:`3975`: Remove legacy code around im_func as that was python2 only   pytest 3.8.0 (2018-09-05) =========================  Deprecations and Removals -------------------------  - :issue:`2452`:``Config.warn`and`Node.warn``have been   deprecated, see [config.warn and node.warn deprecated](#config.warn-and-node.warn-deprecated) for rationale and   examples.  - :issue:`3936`:``@pytest.mark.filterwarnings``second parameter is no longer regex-escaped,   making it possible to actually use regular expressions to check the warning message.    **Note**: regex-escaping the match string was an implementation oversight that might break test suites which depend   on the old behavior.    Features --------  - :issue:`2452`: Internal pytest warnings are now issued using the standard``warnings`module, making it possible to use   the standard warnings filters to manage those warnings. This introduces`PytestWarning`,`PytestDeprecationWarning`and`RemovedInPytest4Warning``warning types as part of the public API.    Consult [the documentation <internal-warnings>](#the-documentation-<internal-warnings>) for more info.   - :issue:`2908`:``DeprecationWarning`and`PendingDeprecationWarning``are now shown by default if no other warning filter is   configured. This makes pytest more compliant with   :pep:`506#recommended-filter-settings-for-test-runners`. See   [the docs <deprecation-warnings>](#the-docs-<deprecation-warnings>) for   more info.   - :issue:`3251`: Warnings are now captured and displayed during test collection.   - :issue:`3784`:``PYTEST\_DISABLE\_PLUGIN\_AUTOLOAD``environment variable disables plugin auto-loading when set.   - :issue:`3829`: Added the``count`option to`console\_output\_style``to enable displaying the progress as a count instead of a percentage.   - :issue:`3837`: Added support for 'xfailed' and 'xpassed' outcomes to the``pytester.RunResult.assert\_outcomes``signature.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3911`: Terminal writer now takes into account unicode character width when writing out progress.   - :issue:`3913`: Pytest now returns with correct exit code (EXIT_USAGEERROR, 4) when called with unknown arguments.   - :issue:`3918`: Improve performance of assertion rewriting.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3566`: Added a blurb in usage.rst for the usage of -r flag which is used to show an extra test summary info.   - :issue:`3907`: Corrected type of the exceptions collection passed to``xfail`:`raises`argument accepts a`tuple`instead of`list``.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`3853`: Removed``"run all (no recorded failures)"`message printed with`--failed-first`and`--last-failed``when there are no failed tests.   pytest 3.7.4 (2018-08-29) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3506`: Fix possible infinite recursion when writing``.pyc``files.   - :issue:`3853`: Cache plugin now obeys the``-q`flag when`--last-failed`and`--failed-first``flags are used.   - :issue:`3883`: Fix bad console output when using``console\_output\_style=classic``.   - :issue:`3888`: Fix macOS specific code using``capturemanager``plugin in doctests.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3902`: Fix pytest.org links   pytest 3.7.3 (2018-08-26) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3033`: Fixtures during teardown can again use``capsys`and`capfd``to inspect output captured during tests.   - :issue:`3773`: Fix collection of tests from``\_\_init\_\_.py`files if they match the`python\_files``configuration option.   - :issue:`3796`: Fix issue where teardown of fixtures of consecutive sub-packages were executed once, at the end of the outer   package.   - :issue:`3816`: Fix bug where``--show-capture=no``option would still show logs printed during fixture teardown.   - :issue:`3819`: Fix``stdout/stderr``not getting captured when real-time cli logging is active.   - :issue:`3843`: Fix collection error when specifying test functions directly in the command line using``test.py::test`syntax together with`--doctest-modules``.   - :issue:`3848`: Fix bugs where unicode arguments could not be passed to``testdir.runpytest``on Python 2.   - :issue:`3854`: Fix double collection of tests within packages when the filename starts with a capital letter.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3824`: Added example for multiple glob pattern matches in``python\_files``.   - :issue:`3833`: Added missing docs for``pytester.Testdir``.   - :issue:`3870`: Correct documentation for setuptools integration.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`3826`: Replace broken type annotations with type comments.   - :issue:`3845`: Remove a reference to issue :issue:`568` from the documentation, which has since been   fixed.   pytest 3.7.2 (2018-08-16) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3671`: Fix``filterwarnings``not being registered as a builtin mark.   - :issue:`3768`, :issue:`3789`: Fix test collection from packages mixed with normal directories.   - :issue:`3771`: Fix infinite recursion during collection if a``pytest\_ignore\_collect`hook returns`False`instead of`None``.   - :issue:`3774`: Fix bug where decorated fixtures would lose functionality (for example``@mock.patch``).   - :issue:`3775`: Fix bug where importing modules or other objects with prefix``[pytest]()`prefix would raise a`PluginValidationError``.   - :issue:`3788`: Fix``AttributeError`during teardown of`TestCase`subclasses which raise an exception during`\_\_init\_\_``.   - :issue:`3804`: Fix traceback reporting for exceptions with``\_\_cause\_\_``cycles.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3746`: Add documentation for``metafunc.config``that had been mistakenly hidden.   pytest 3.7.1 (2018-08-02) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`3473`: Raise immediately if``approx()``is given an expected value of a type it doesn't understand (e.g. strings, nested dicts, etc.).   - :issue:`3712`: Correctly represent the dimensions of a numpy array when calling``repr()`on`approx()``.  - :issue:`3742`: Fix incompatibility with third party plugins during collection, which produced the error``object has no attribute '\_collectfile'``.  - :issue:`3745`: Display the absolute path if``cache\_dir`is not relative to the`rootdir``instead of failing.   - :issue:`3747`: Fix compatibility problem with plugins and the warning code issued by fixture functions when they are called directly.   - :issue:`3748`: Fix infinite recursion in``pytest.approx`with arrays in`numpy\<1.13``.   - :issue:`3757`: Pin pathlib2 to``\>=2.2.0`as we require`\_\_fspath\_\_``support.   - :issue:`3763`: Fix``TypeError`when the assertion message is`bytes``in python 3.   pytest 3.7.0 (2018-07-30) =========================  Deprecations and Removals -------------------------  - :issue:`2639`:``pytest\_namespace``has been [deprecated <pytest.namespace deprecated>](#deprecated-<pytest.namespace-deprecated>).   - :issue:`3661`: Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, now issues a``RemovedInPytest4Warning``. See [the documentation for rationale and examples <calling fixtures directly deprecated>](#the-documentation-for-rationale-and-examples-<calling-fixtures-directly-deprecated>).    Features --------  - :issue:`2283`: New``package``fixture scope: fixtures are finalized when the last test of a *package* finishes. This feature is considered **experimental**, so use it sparingly.   - :issue:`3576`:``Node.add\_marker`now supports an`append=True/False``parameter to determine whether the mark comes last (default) or first.   - :issue:`3579`: Fixture``caplog`now has a`messages``property, providing convenient access to the format-interpolated log messages without the extra data provided by the formatter/handler.   - :issue:`3610`: New``--trace``option to enter the debugger at the start of a test.   - :issue:`3623`: Introduce``pytester.copy\_example``as helper to do acceptance tests against examples from the project.    Bug Fixes ---------  - :issue:`2220`: Fix a bug where fixtures overridden by direct parameters (for example parametrization) were being instantiated even if they were not being used by a test.   - :issue:`3695`: Fix``ApproxNumpy`initialisation argument mixup,`abs`and`rel`tolerances were flipped causing strange comparison results.   Add tests to check`abs`and`rel`tolerances for`np.array`and test for expecting`nan`with`np.array()``- :issue:`980`: Fix truncated locals output in verbose mode.    Improved Documentation ----------------------  - :issue:`3295`: Correct the usage documentation of``--last-failed-no-failures`by adding the missing`--last-failed``argument in the presented examples, because they are misleading and lead to think that the missing argument is not needed.    Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - :issue:`3519`: Now a``README.md`file is created in`.pytest\_cache`to make it clear why the directory exists.   pytest 3.6.4 (2018-07-28) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - Invoke pytest using`-mpytest`so`sys.path`does not get polluted by packages installed in`site-packages``. (:issue:`742`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - Use``smtp\_connection`instead of`smtp``in fixtures documentation to avoid possible confusion. (:issue:`3592`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - Remove obsolete``\_\_future\_\_``imports. (:issue:`2319`)  - Add CITATION to provide information on how to formally cite pytest. (:issue:`3402`)  - Replace broken type annotations with type comments. (:issue:`3635`)  - Pin``pluggy`to`\<0.8``. (:issue:`3727`)   pytest 3.6.3 (2018-07-04) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - Fix``ImportWarning``triggered by explicit relative imports in   assertion-rewritten package modules. (:issue:`3061`)  - Fix error in``pytest.approx``when dealing with 0-dimension numpy   arrays. (:issue:`3593`)  - No longer raise``ValueError`when using the`get\_marker``API. (:issue:`3605`)  - Fix problem where log messages with non-ascii characters would not   appear in the output log file.   (:issue:`3630`)  - No longer raise``AttributeError``when legacy marks can't be stored in   functions. (:issue:`3631`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - The description above the example for``@pytest.mark.skipif``now better   matches the code. (:issue:`3611`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - Internal refactoring: removed unused``CallSpec2tox .\_globalid\_args`attribute and`metafunc`parameter from`CallSpec2.copy()``. (:issue:`3598`)  - Silence usage of``reduce``warning in Python 2 (:issue:`3609`)  - Fix usage of``attr.ib`deprecated`convert``parameter. (:issue:`3653`)   pytest 3.6.2 (2018-06-20) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - Fix regression in``Node.add\_marker`by extracting the mark object of a`MarkDecorator``. (:issue:`3555`)  - Warnings without``location`were reported as`None`. This is corrected to   now report`\<undetermined location\>``. (:issue:`3563`)  - Continue to call finalizers in the stack when a finalizer in a former scope   raises an exception. (:issue:`3569`)  - Fix encoding error with``print``statements in doctests (:issue:`3583`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - Add documentation for the``--strict``flag. (:issue:`3549`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - Update old quotation style to parens in fixture.rst documentation. (:issue:`3525`)  - Improve display of hint about``--fulltrace`with`KeyboardInterrupt``.   (:issue:`3545`)  - pytest's testsuite is no longer runnable through``python setup.py test`--   instead invoke`pytest`or`tox``directly. (:issue:`3552`)  - Fix typo in documentation (:issue:`3567`)   pytest 3.6.1 (2018-06-05) =========================  Bug Fixes ---------  - Fixed a bug where stdout and stderr were logged twice by junitxml when a test   was marked xfail. (:issue:`3491`)  - Fix``usefixtures`mark applied to unittest tests by correctly instantiating`FixtureInfo``. (:issue:`3498`)  - Fix assertion rewriter compatibility with libraries that monkey patch``file``objects. (:issue:`3503`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - Added a section on how to use fixtures as factories to the fixture   documentation. (:issue:`3461`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - Enable caching for pip/pre-commit in order to reduce build time on   travis/appveyor. (:issue:`3502`)  - Switch pytest to the src/ layout as we already suggested it for good practice   - now we implement it as well. (:issue:`3513`)  - Fix if in tests to support 3.7.0b5, where a docstring handling in AST got   reverted. (:issue:`3530`)  - Remove some python2.5 compatibility code. (:issue:`3529`)   pytest 3.6.0 (2018-05-23) =========================  Features --------  - Revamp the internals of the``pytest.mark`implementation with correct per   node handling which fixes a number of long standing bugs caused by the old   design. This introduces new`Node.iter\_markers(name)`and`Node.get\_closest\_marker(name)``APIs. Users are **strongly encouraged** to   read the [reasons for the revamp in the docs <marker-revamp>](#reasons-for-the-revamp-in-the-docs-<marker-revamp>),   or jump over to details about [updating existing code to use the new APIs   <update marker code>](#updating-existing-code-to-use-the-new-apis --<update-marker-code>).   (:issue:`3317`)  - Now when``@pytest.fixture`is applied more than once to the same function a`ValueError``is raised. This buggy behavior would cause surprising problems   and if was working for a test suite it was mostly by accident. (:issue:`2334`)  - Support for Python 3.7's builtin``breakpoint()``method, see   [Using the builtin breakpoint function <breakpoint-builtin>](#using-the-builtin-breakpoint-function-<breakpoint-builtin>) for   details. (:issue:`3180`)  -``monkeypatch`now supports a`context()`function which acts as a context   manager which undoes all patching done within the`with``block. (:issue:`3290`)  - The``--pdb``option now causes KeyboardInterrupt to enter the debugger,   instead of stopping the test session. On python 2.7, hitting CTRL+C again   exits the debugger. On python 3.2 and higher, use CTRL+D. (:issue:`3299`)  - pytest no longer changes the log level of the root logger when the``log-level``parameter has greater numeric value than that of the level of   the root logger, which makes it play better with custom logging configuration   in user code. (:issue:`3307`)   Bug Fixes ---------  - A rare race-condition which might result in corrupted``.pyc``files on   Windows has been hopefully solved. (:issue:`3008`)  - Also use iter_marker for discovering the marks applying for marker   expressions from the cli to avoid the bad data from the legacy mark storage.   (:issue:`3441`)  - When showing diffs of failed assertions where the contents contain only   whitespace, escape them using``repr()``first to make it easy to spot the   differences. (:issue:`3443`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - Change documentation copyright year to a range which auto-updates itself each   time it is published. (:issue:`3303`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  -``pytest``now depends on the `python-atomicwrites   <https://github.com/untitaker/python-atomicwrites>`_ library. (:issue:`3008`)  - Update all pypi.python.org URLs to pypi.org. (:issue:`3431`)  - Detect `pytest_` prefixed hooks using the internal plugin manager since``pluggy`is deprecating the`implprefix`argument to`PluginManager``.   (:issue:`3487`)  - Import``Mapping`and`Sequence`from`\_pytest.compat`instead of   directly from`collections`in`python\_api.py::approx`. Add`Mapping`to`\_pytest.compat`, import it from`collections`on python 2, but from`collections.abc`on Python 3 to avoid a`DeprecationWarning``on Python   3.7 or newer. (:issue:`3497`)   pytest 3.5.1 (2018-04-23) =========================   Bug Fixes ---------  - Reset``sys.last\_type`,`sys.last\_value`and`sys.last\_traceback``before   each test executes. Those attributes are added by pytest during the test run   to aid debugging, but were never reset so they would create a leaking   reference to the last failing test's frame which in turn could never be   reclaimed by the garbage collector. (:issue:`2798`)  -``pytest.raises`now raises`TypeError``when receiving an unknown keyword   argument. (:issue:`3348`)  -``pytest.raises``now works with exception classes that look like iterables.   (:issue:`3372`)   Improved Documentation ----------------------  - Fix typo in``caplog``fixture documentation, which incorrectly identified   certain attributes as methods. (:issue:`3406`)   Trivial/Internal Changes ------------------------  - Added a more indicative error message when parametrizing a function whose   argument takes a default value. (:issue:`3221`)  - Remove internal``\_pytest.terminal.flatten`function in favor of`more\_itertools.collapse``. (:issue:`3330`)  - Import some modules from``collections.abc`instead of`collections`as   the former modules trigger`DeprecationWarning``in Python 3.7. (:issue:`3339`)  - record_property is no longer experimental, removing the warnings was   forgotten. (:issue:`3360`)  - Mention in documentation and CLI help that fixtures with leading``\_`are   printed by`pytest --fixtures`only if the`-v``option is added. (:issue:`3398`)   pytest 3.5.0 (2018-03-21) =========================  Deprecations and Removals -------------------------  -``record\_xml\_property`fixture is now deprecated in favor of the more   generic`record\_property``. (:issue:`2770`)  - Defining``pytest\_plugins``is now deprecated in non-top-level conftest.py   files, because they "leak" to the entire directory tree.   [See the docs <pytest_plugins in non-top-level conftest files deprecated>](#see-the-docs-<pytest_plugins-in-non-top-level-conftest-files-deprecated>)   for the rationale behind this decision (:issue:`3084`)   Features --------  - New``--show-capture`command-line option that allows to specify how to   display captured output when tests fail:`no`,`stdout`,`stderr`,`log`or`all``(the default). (:issue:`1478`)  - New``--rootdir``command-line option to override the rules for discovering   the root directory. See [customize <reference/customize>](customize <reference/customize>.md) in the documentation for   details. (:issue:`1642`)  - Fixtures are now instantiated based on their scopes, with higher-scoped   fixtures (such as``session`) being instantiated first than lower-scoped   fixtures (such as`function``). The relative order of fixtures of the same   scope is kept unchanged, based in their declaration order and their   dependencies. (:issue:`2405`)  -``record\_xml\_property`renamed to`record\_property`and is now compatible   with xdist, markers and any reporter.`record\_xml\_property``name is now   deprecated. (:issue:`2770`)  - New``--nf`,`--new-first``options: run new tests first followed by the   rest of the tests, in both cases tests are also sorted by the file modified   time, with more recent files coming first. (:issue:`3034`)  - New``--last-failed-no-failures`command-line option that allows to specify   the behavior of the cache plugin's`<span class="title-ref">--last-failed</span><span class="title-ref"> feature when no tests failed in the last run (or no cache was found): </span><span class="title-ref">none</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">all</span><span class="title-ref"> (the default). (:issue:\`3139</span>)

  - New `--doctest-continue-on-failure` command-line option to enable doctests to show multiple failures for each snippet, instead of stopping at the first failure. (`3149`)
  - Captured log messages are added to the `<system-out>` tag in the generated junit xml file if the `junit_logging` ini option is set to `system-out`. If the value of this ini option is `system-err`, the logs are written to `<system-err>`. The default value for `junit_logging` is `no`, meaning captured logs are not written to the output file. (`3156`)
  - Allow the logging plugin to handle `pytest_runtest_logstart` and `pytest_runtest_logfinish` hooks when live logs are enabled. (`3189`)
  - Passing `--log-cli-level` in the command-line now automatically activates live logging. (`3190`)
  - Add command line option `--deselect` to allow deselection of individual tests at collection time. (`3198`)
  - Captured logs are printed before entering pdb. (`3204`)
  - Deselected item count is now shown before tests are run, e.g. `collected X items / Y deselected`. (`3213`)
  - The builtin module `platform` is now available for use in expressions in `pytest.mark`. (`3236`)
  - The *short test summary info* section now is displayed after tracebacks and warnings in the terminal. (`3255`)
  - New `--verbosity` flag to set verbosity level explicitly. (`3296`)
  - `pytest.approx` now accepts comparing a numpy array with a scalar. (`3312`)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Suppress `IOError` when closing the temporary file used for capturing streams in Python 2.7. (`2370`)
  - Fixed `clear()` method on `caplog` fixture which cleared `records`, but not the `text` property. (`3297`)
  - During test collection, when stdin is not allowed to be read, the `DontReadFromStdin` object still allow itself to be iterable and resolved to an iterator without crashing. (`3314`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Added a \[reference \<reference/reference\>\](reference \<reference/reference\>.md) page to the docs. (`1713`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Change minimum requirement of `attrs` to `17.4.0`. (`3228`)
  - Renamed example directories so all tests pass when ran from the base directory. (`3245`)
  - Internal `mark.py` module has been turned into a package. (`3250`)
  - `pytest` now depends on the [more-itertools](https://github.com/erikrose/more-itertools) package. (`3265`)
  - Added warning when `[pytest]` section is used in a `.cfg` file passed with `-c` (`3268`)
  - `nodeids` can now be passed explicitly to `FSCollector` and `Node` constructors. (`3291`)
  - Internal refactoring of `FormattedExcinfo` to use `attrs` facilities and remove old support code for legacy Python versions. (`3292`)
  - Refactoring to unify how verbosity is handled internally. (`3296`)
  - Internal refactoring to better integrate with argparse. (`3304`)
  - Fix a python example when calling a fixture in doc/en/usage.rst (`3308`)

### pytest 3.4.2 (2018-03-04)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Removed progress information when capture option is `no`. (`3203`)
  - Refactor check of bindir from `exists` to `isdir`. (`3241`)
  - Fix `TypeError` issue when using `approx` with a `Decimal` value. (`3247`)
  - Fix reference cycle generated when using the `request` fixture. (`3249`)
  - `[tool:pytest]` sections in `*.cfg` files passed by the `-c` option are now properly recognized. (`3260`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Add logging plugin to plugins list. (`3209`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Fix minor typo in fixture.rst (`3259`)

### pytest 3.4.1 (2018-02-20)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Move import of `doctest.UnexpectedException` to top-level to avoid possible errors when using `--pdb`. (`1810`)
  - Added printing of captured stdout/stderr before entering pdb, and improved a test which was giving false negatives about output capturing. (`3052`)
  - Fix ordering of tests using parametrized fixtures which can lead to fixtures being created more than necessary. (`3161`)
  - Fix bug where logging happening at hooks outside of "test run" hooks would cause an internal error. (`3184`)
  - Detect arguments injected by `unittest.mock.patch` decorator correctly when pypi `mock.patch` is installed and imported. (`3206`)
  - Errors shown when a `pytest.raises()` with `match=` fails are now cleaner on what happened: When no exception was raised, the "matching '...'" part got removed as it falsely implies that an exception was raised but it didn't match. When a wrong exception was raised, it's now thrown (like `pytest.raised()` without `match=` would) instead of complaining about the unmatched text. (`3222`)
  - Fixed output capture handling in doctests on macOS. (`985`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Add Sphinx parameter docs for `match` and `message` args to `pytest.raises`. (`3202`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - pytest has changed the publication procedure and is now being published to PyPI directly from Travis. (`3060`)
  - Rename `ParameterSet._for_parameterize()` to `_for_parametrize()` in order to comply with the naming convention. (`3166`)
  - Skip failing pdb/doctest test on mac. (`985`)

### pytest 3.4.0 (2018-01-30)

#### Deprecations and Removals

  - All pytest classes now subclass `object` for better Python 2/3 compatibility. This should not affect user code except in very rare edge cases. (`2147`)

#### Features

  - Introduce `empty_parameter_set_mark` ini option to select which mark to apply when `@pytest.mark.parametrize` is given an empty set of parameters. Valid options are `skip` (default) and `xfail`. Note that it is planned to change the default to `xfail` in future releases as this is considered less error prone. (`2527`)
  - **Incompatible change**: after community feedback the \[logging \<how-to/logging\>\](logging \<how-to/logging\>.md) functionality has undergone some changes. Please consult the \[logging documentation \<log\_changes\_3\_4\>\](\#logging-documentation-\<log\_changes\_3\_4\>) for details. (`3013`)
  - Console output falls back to "classic" mode when capturing is disabled (`-s`), otherwise the output gets garbled to the point of being useless. (`3038`)
  - New `pytest_runtest_logfinish` hook which is called when a test item has finished executing, analogous to `pytest_runtest_logstart`. (`3101`)
  - Improve performance when collecting tests using many fixtures. (`3107`)
  - New `caplog.get_records(when)` method which provides access to the captured records for the `"setup"`, `"call"` and `"teardown"` testing stages. (`3117`)
  - New fixture `record_xml_attribute` that allows modifying and inserting attributes on the `<testcase>` xml node in JUnit reports. (`3130`)
  - The default cache directory has been renamed from `.cache` to `.pytest_cache` after community feedback that the name `.cache` did not make it clear that it was used by pytest. (`3138`)
  - Colorize the levelname column in the live-log output. (`3142`)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fix hanging pexpect test on macOS by using flush() instead of wait(). (`2022`)
  - Fix restoring Python state after in-process pytest runs with the `pytester` plugin; this may break tests using multiple inprocess pytest runs if later ones depend on earlier ones leaking global interpreter changes. (`3016`)
  - Fix skipping plugin reporting hook when test aborted before plugin setup hook. (`3074`)
  - Fix progress percentage reported when tests fail during teardown. (`3088`)
  - **Incompatible change**: `-o/--override` option no longer eats all the remaining options, which can lead to surprising behavior: for example, `pytest -o foo=1 /path/to/test.py` would fail because `/path/to/test.py` would be considered as part of the `-o` command-line argument. One consequence of this is that now multiple configuration overrides need multiple `-o` flags: `pytest -o foo=1 -o bar=2`. (`3103`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Document hooks (defined with `historic=True`) which cannot be used with `hookwrapper=True`. (`2423`)
  - Clarify that warning capturing doesn't change the warning filter by default. (`2457`)
  - Clarify a possible confusion when using pytest\_fixture\_setup with fixture functions that return None. (`2698`)
  - Fix the wording of a sentence on doctest flags used in pytest. (`3076`)
  - Prefer `https://*.readthedocs.io` over `http://*.rtfd.org` for links in the documentation. (`3092`)
  - Improve readability (wording, grammar) of Getting Started guide (`3131`)
  - Added note that calling pytest.main multiple times from the same process is not recommended because of import caching. (`3143`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Show a simple and easy error when keyword expressions trigger a syntax error (for example, `"-k foo and import"` will show an error that you cannot use the `import` keyword in expressions). (`2953`)
  - Change parametrized automatic test id generation to use the `__name__` attribute of functions instead of the fallback argument name plus counter. (`2976`)
  - Replace py.std with stdlib imports. (`3067`)
  - Corrected 'you' to 'your' in logging docs. (`3129`)

### pytest 3.3.2 (2017-12-25)

#### Bug Fixes

  - pytester: ignore files used to obtain current user metadata in the fd leak detector. (`2784`)
  - Fix **memory leak** where objects returned by fixtures were never destructed by the garbage collector. (`2981`)
  - Fix conversion of pyargs to filename to not convert symlinks on Python 2. (`2985`)
  - `PYTEST_DONT_REWRITE` is now checked for plugins too rather than only for test modules. (`2995`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Add clarifying note about behavior of multiple parametrized arguments (`3001`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Code cleanup. (`3015`, `3021`)
  - Clean up code by replacing imports and references of `_ast` to `ast`. (`3018`)

### pytest 3.3.1 (2017-12-05)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fix issue about `-p no:<plugin>` having no effect. (`2920`)
  - Fix regression with warnings that contained non-strings in their arguments in Python 2. (`2956`)
  - Always escape null bytes when setting `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST`. (`2957`)
  - Fix `ZeroDivisionError` when using the `testmon` plugin when no tests were actually collected. (`2971`)
  - Bring back `TerminalReporter.writer` as an alias to `TerminalReporter._tw`. This alias was removed by accident in the `3.3.0` release. (`2984`)
  - The `pytest-capturelog` plugin is now also blacklisted, avoiding errors when running pytest with it still installed. (`3004`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Fix broken link to plugin `pytest-localserver`. (`2963`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Update github "bugs" link in `CONTRIBUTING.rst` (`2949`)

### pytest 3.3.0 (2017-11-23)

#### Deprecations and Removals

  - pytest no longer supports Python **2.6** and **3.3**. Those Python versions are EOL for some time now and incur maintenance and compatibility costs on the pytest core team, and following up with the rest of the community we decided that they will no longer be supported starting on this version. Users which still require those versions should pin pytest to `<3.3`. (`2812`)
  - Remove internal `_preloadplugins()` function. This removal is part of the `pytest_namespace()` hook deprecation. (`2636`)
  - Internally change `CallSpec2` to have a list of marks instead of a broken mapping of keywords. This removes the keywords attribute of the internal `CallSpec2` class. (`2672`)
  - Remove ParameterSet.deprecated\_arg\_dict - its not a public api and the lack of the underscore was a naming error. (`2675`)
  - Remove the internal multi-typed attribute `Node._evalskip` and replace it with the boolean `Node._skipped_by_mark`. (`2767`)
  - The `params` list passed to `pytest.fixture` is now for all effects considered immutable and frozen at the moment of the `pytest.fixture` call. Previously the list could be changed before the first invocation of the fixture allowing for a form of dynamic parametrization (for example, updated from command-line options), but this was an unwanted implementation detail which complicated the internals and prevented some internal cleanup. See issue `2959` for details and a recommended workaround.

#### Features

  - `pytest_fixture_post_finalizer` hook can now receive a `request` argument. (`2124`)
  - Replace the old introspection code in compat.py that determines the available arguments of fixtures with inspect.signature on Python 3 and funcsigs.signature on Python 2. This should respect `__signature__` declarations on functions. (`2267`)
  - Report tests with global `pytestmark` variable only once. (`2549`)
  - Now pytest displays the total progress percentage while running tests. The previous output style can be set by configuring the `console_output_style` setting to `classic`. (`2657`)
  - Match `warns` signature to `raises` by adding `match` keyword. (`2708`)
  - pytest now captures and displays output from the standard `logging` module. The user can control the logging level to be captured by specifying options in `pytest.ini`, the command line and also during individual tests using markers. Also, a `caplog` fixture is available that enables users to test the captured log during specific tests (similar to `capsys` for example). For more information, please see the \[logging docs \<how-to/logging\>\](logging docs \<how-to/logging\>.md). This feature was introduced by merging the popular `pytest-catchlog` plugin, thanks to `thisch`. Be advised that during the merging the backward compatibility interface with the defunct `pytest-capturelog` has been dropped. (`2794`)
  - Add `allow_module_level` kwarg to `pytest.skip()`, enabling to skip the whole module. (`2808`)
  - Allow setting `file_or_dir`, `-c`, and `-o` in PYTEST\_ADDOPTS. (`2824`)
  - Return stdout/stderr capture results as a `namedtuple`, so `out` and `err` can be accessed by attribute. (`2879`)
  - Add `capfdbinary`, a version of `capfd` which returns bytes from `readouterr()`. (`2923`)
  - Add `capsysbinary` a version of `capsys` which returns bytes from `readouterr()`. (`2934`)
  - Implement feature to skip `setup.py` files when run with `--doctest-modules`. (`502`)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Resume output capturing after `capsys/capfd.disabled()` context manager. (`1993`)
  - `pytest_fixture_setup` and `pytest_fixture_post_finalizer` hooks are now called for all `conftest.py` files. (`2124`)
  - If an exception happens while loading a plugin, pytest no longer hides the original traceback. In Python 2 it will show the original traceback with a new message that explains in which plugin. In Python 3 it will show 2 canonized exceptions, the original exception while loading the plugin in addition to an exception that pytest throws about loading a plugin. (`2491`)
  - `capsys` and `capfd` can now be used by other fixtures. (`2709`)
  - Internal `pytester` plugin properly encodes `bytes` arguments to `utf-8`. (`2738`)
  - `testdir` now uses use the same method used by `tmpdir` to create its temporary directory. This changes the final structure of the `testdir` directory slightly, but should not affect usage in normal scenarios and avoids a number of potential problems. (`2751`)
  - pytest no longer complains about warnings with unicode messages being non-ascii compatible even for ascii-compatible messages. As a result of this, warnings with unicode messages are converted first to an ascii representation for safety. (`2809`)
  - Change return value of pytest command when `--maxfail` is reached from `2` (interrupted) to `1` (failed). (`2845`)
  - Fix issue in assertion rewriting which could lead it to rewrite modules which should not be rewritten. (`2939`)
  - Handle marks without description in `pytest.ini`. (`2942`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - pytest now depends on `attrs` for internal structures to ease code maintainability. (`2641`)
  - Refactored internal Python 2/3 compatibility code to use `six`. (`2642`)
  - Stop vendoring `pluggy` - we're missing out on its latest changes for not much benefit (`2719`)
  - Internal refactor: simplify ascii string escaping by using the backslashreplace error handler in newer Python 3 versions. (`2734`)
  - Remove unnecessary mark evaluator in unittest plugin (`2767`)
  - Calls to `Metafunc.addcall` now emit a deprecation warning. This function is scheduled to be removed in `pytest-4.0`. (`2876`)
  - Internal move of the parameterset extraction to a more maintainable place. (`2877`)
  - Internal refactoring to simplify scope node lookup. (`2910`)
  - Configure `pytest` to prevent pip from installing pytest in unsupported Python versions. (`2922`)

### pytest 3.2.5 (2017-11-15)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Remove `py<1.5` restriction from `pytest` as this can cause version conflicts in some installations. (`2926`)

### pytest 3.2.4 (2017-11-13)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fix the bug where running with `--pyargs` will result in items with empty `parent.nodeid` if run from a different root directory. (`2775`)
  - Fix issue with `@pytest.parametrize` if argnames was specified as keyword arguments. (`2819`)
  - Strip whitespace from marker names when reading them from INI config. (`2856`)
  - Show full context of doctest source in the pytest output, if the line number of failed example in the docstring is \< 9. (`2882`)
  - Match fixture paths against actual path segments in order to avoid matching folders which share a prefix. (`2836`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Introduce a dedicated section about conftest.py. (`1505`)
  - Explicitly mention `xpass` in the documentation of `xfail`. (`1997`)
  - Append example for pytest.param in the example/parametrize document. (`2658`)
  - Clarify language of proposal for fixtures parameters (`2893`)
  - List python 3.6 in the documented supported versions in the getting started document. (`2903`)
  - Clarify the documentation of available fixture scopes. (`538`)
  - Add documentation about the `python -m pytest` invocation adding the current directory to sys.path. (`911`)

### pytest 3.2.3 (2017-10-03)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fix crash in tab completion when no prefix is given. (`2748`)
  - The equality checking function (`__eq__`) of `MarkDecorator` returns `False` if one object is not an instance of `MarkDecorator`. (`2758`)
  - When running `pytest --fixtures-per-test`: don't crash if an item has no \_fixtureinfo attribute (e.g. doctests) (`2788`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - In help text of `-k` option, add example of using `not` to not select certain tests whose names match the provided expression. (`1442`)
  - Add note in `parametrize.rst` about calling `metafunc.parametrize` multiple times. (`1548`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Set `xfail_strict=True` in pytest's own test suite to catch expected failures as soon as they start to pass. (`2722`)
  - Fix typo in example of passing a callable to markers (in example/markers.rst) (`2765`)

### pytest 3.2.2 (2017-09-06)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Calling the deprecated `request.getfuncargvalue()` now shows the source of the call. (`2681`)
  - Allow tests declared as `@staticmethod` to use fixtures. (`2699`)
  - Fixed edge-case during collection: attributes which raised `pytest.fail` when accessed would abort the entire collection. (`2707`)
  - Fix `ReprFuncArgs` with mixed unicode and UTF-8 args. (`2731`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - In examples on working with custom markers, add examples demonstrating the usage of `pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.with_args` in comparison with `pytest.mark.MARKER_NAME.__call__` (`2604`)
  - In one of the simple examples, use `pytest_collection_modifyitems()` to skip tests based on a command-line option, allowing its sharing while preventing a user error when accessing `pytest.config` before the argument parsing. (`2653`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Fixed minor error in 'Good Practices/Manual Integration' code snippet. (`2691`)
  - Fixed typo in goodpractices.rst. (`2721`)
  - Improve user guidance regarding `--resultlog` deprecation. (`2739`)

### pytest 3.2.1 (2017-08-08)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fixed small terminal glitch when collecting a single test item. (`2579`)
  - Correctly consider `/` as the file separator to automatically mark plugin files for rewrite on Windows. (`2591`)
  - Properly escape test names when setting `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` environment variable. (`2644`)
  - Fix error on Windows and Python 3.6+ when `sys.stdout` has been replaced with a stream-like object which does not implement the full `io` module buffer protocol. In particular this affects `pytest-xdist` users on the aforementioned platform. (`2666`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Explicitly document which pytest features work with `unittest`. (`2626`)

### pytest 3.2.0 (2017-07-30)

#### Deprecations and Removals

  - `pytest.approx` no longer supports `>`, `>=`, `<` and `<=` operators to avoid surprising/inconsistent behavior. See the <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.approx</span> docs for more information. (`2003`)
  - All old-style specific behavior in current classes in the pytest's API is considered deprecated at this point and will be removed in a future release. This affects Python 2 users only and in rare situations. (`2147`)
  - A deprecation warning is now raised when using marks for parameters in `pytest.mark.parametrize`. Use `pytest.param` to apply marks to parameters instead. (`2427`)

#### Features

  - Add support for numpy arrays (and dicts) to approx. (`1994`)
  - Now test function objects have a `pytestmark` attribute containing a list of marks applied directly to the test function, as opposed to marks inherited from parent classes or modules. (`2516`)
  - Collection ignores local virtualenvs by default; `--collect-in-virtualenv` overrides this behavior. (`2518`)
  - Allow class methods decorated as `@staticmethod` to be candidates for collection as a test function. (Only for Python 2.7 and above. Python 2.6 will still ignore static methods.) (`2528`)
  - Introduce `mark.with_args` in order to allow passing functions/classes as sole argument to marks. (`2540`)
  - New `cache_dir` ini option: sets the directory where the contents of the cache plugin are stored. Directory may be relative or absolute path: if relative path, then directory is created relative to `rootdir`, otherwise it is used as is. Additionally path may contain environment variables which are expanded during runtime. (`2543`)
  - Introduce the `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` environment variable that is set with the `nodeid` and stage (`setup`, `call` and `teardown`) of the test being currently executed. See the \[documentation \<pytest current test env\>\](\#documentation-\<pytest-current-test-env\>) for more info. (`2583`)
  - Introduced `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings` mark which allows overwriting the warnings filter on a per test, class or module level. See the \[docs \<filterwarnings\>\](\#docs-\<filterwarnings\>) for more information. (`2598`)
  - `--last-failed` now remembers forever when a test has failed and only forgets it if it passes again. This makes it easy to fix a test suite by selectively running files and fixing tests incrementally. (`2621`)
  - New `pytest_report_collectionfinish` hook which allows plugins to add messages to the terminal reporting after collection has been finished successfully. (`2622`)
  - Added support for `415`'s `Exception.__suppress_context__`. Now if a `raise exception from None` is caught by pytest, pytest will no longer chain the context in the test report. The behavior now matches Python's traceback behavior. (`2631`)
  - Exceptions raised by `pytest.fail`, `pytest.skip` and `pytest.xfail` now subclass BaseException, making them harder to be caught unintentionally by normal code. (`580`)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Set `stdin` to a closed `PIPE` in `pytester.py.Testdir.popen()` for avoid unwanted interactive `pdb` (`2023`)
  - Add missing `encoding` attribute to `sys.std*` streams when using `capsys` capture mode. (`2375`)
  - Fix terminal color changing to black on Windows if `colorama` is imported in a `conftest.py` file. (`2510`)
  - Fix line number when reporting summary of skipped tests. (`2548`)
  - capture: ensure that EncodedFile.name is a string. (`2555`)
  - The options `--fixtures` and `--fixtures-per-test` will now keep indentation within docstrings. (`2574`)
  - doctests line numbers are now reported correctly, fixing [pytest-sugar\#122](https://github.com/Frozenball/pytest-sugar/issues/122). (`2610`)
  - Fix non-determinism in order of fixture collection. Adds new dependency (ordereddict) for Python 2.6. (`920`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Clarify `pytest_configure` hook call order. (`2539`)
  - Extend documentation for testing plugin code with the `pytester` plugin. (`971`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Update help message for `--strict` to make it clear it only deals with unregistered markers, not warnings. (`2444`)
  - Internal code move: move code for pytest.approx/pytest.raises to own files in order to cut down the size of python.py (`2489`)
  - Renamed the utility function `_pytest.compat._escape_strings` to `_ascii_escaped` to better communicate the function's purpose. (`2533`)
  - Improve error message for CollectError with skip/skipif. (`2546`)
  - Emit warning about `yield` tests being deprecated only once per generator. (`2562`)
  - Ensure final collected line doesn't include artifacts of previous write. (`2571`)
  - Fixed all flake8 errors and warnings. (`2581`)
  - Added `fix-lint` tox environment to run automatic pep8 fixes on the code. (`2582`)
  - Turn warnings into errors in pytest's own test suite in order to catch regressions due to deprecations more promptly. (`2588`)
  - Show multiple issue links in CHANGELOG entries. (`2620`)

### pytest 3.1.3 (2017-07-03)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Fix decode error in Python 2 for doctests in docstrings. (`2434`)
  - Exceptions raised during teardown by finalizers are now suppressed until all finalizers are called, with the initial exception reraised. (`2440`)
  - Fix incorrect "collected items" report when specifying tests on the command-line. (`2464`)
  - `deprecated_call` in context-manager form now captures deprecation warnings even if the same warning has already been raised. Also, `deprecated_call` will always produce the same error message (previously it would produce different messages in context-manager vs. function-call mode). (`2469`)
  - Fix issue where paths collected by pytest could have triple leading `/` characters. (`2475`)
  - Fix internal error when trying to detect the start of a recursive traceback. (`2486`)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Explicitly state for which hooks the calls stop after the first non-None result. (`2493`)

#### Trivial/Internal Changes

  - Create invoke tasks for updating the vendored packages. (`2474`)
  - Update copyright dates in LICENSE, README.rst and in the documentation. (`2499`)

### pytest 3.1.2 (2017-06-08)

#### Bug Fixes

  - Required options added via `pytest_addoption` will no longer prevent using --help without passing them. (\#1999)
  - Respect `python_files` in assertion rewriting. (\#2121)
  - Fix recursion error detection when frames in the traceback contain objects that can't be compared (like `numpy` arrays). (\#2459)
  - `UnicodeWarning` is issued from the internal pytest warnings plugin only when the message contains non-ascii unicode (Python 2 only). (\#2463)
  - Added a workaround for Python 3.6 `WindowsConsoleIO` breaking due to Pytests's `FDCapture`. Other code using console handles might still be affected by the very same issue and might require further workarounds/fixes, i.e. `colorama`. (\#2467)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Fix internal API links to `pluggy` objects. (\#2331)
  - Make it clear that `pytest.xfail` stops test execution at the calling point and improve overall flow of the `skipping` docs. (\#810)

### pytest 3.1.1 (2017-05-30)

#### Bug Fixes

  - pytest warning capture no longer overrides existing warning filters. The previous behaviour would override all filters and caused regressions in test suites which configure warning filters to match their needs. Note that as a side-effect of this is that `DeprecationWarning` and `PendingDeprecationWarning` are no longer shown by default. (\#2430)
  - Fix issue with non-ascii contents in doctest text files. (\#2434)
  - Fix encoding errors for unicode warnings in Python 2. (\#2436)
  - `pytest.deprecated_call` now captures `PendingDeprecationWarning` in context manager form. (\#2441)

#### Improved Documentation

  - Addition of towncrier for changelog management. (\#2390)

### 3.1.0 (2017-05-22)

#### New Features

  - \* The `pytest-warnings` plugin has been integrated into the core and now `pytest` automatically  
    captures and displays warnings at the end of the test session.
    
    \> **Warning**

  - \>  
    This feature may disrupt test suites which apply and treat warnings themselves, and can be disabled in your `pytest.ini`:
    
      - \`\`\`ini  
        \[pytest\] addopts = -p no:warnings
    
    See the \[warnings documentation page \<how-to/capture-warnings\>\](warnings documentation page \<how-to/capture-warnings\>.md) for more information.
    
    Thanks `nicoddemus` for the PR.

<!-- end list -->

  - Added `junit_suite_name` ini option to specify root `<testsuite>` name for JUnit XML reports (`533`).
  - Added an ini option `doctest_encoding` to specify which encoding to use for doctest files. Thanks `wheerd` for the PR (`2101`).
  - `pytest.warns` now checks for subclass relationship rather than class equality. Thanks `lesteve` for the PR (`2166`)
  - `pytest.raises` now asserts that the error message matches a text or regex with the `match` keyword argument. Thanks `Kriechi` for the PR.
  - `pytest.param` can be used to declare test parameter sets with marks and test ids. Thanks `RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.

Changes `` ` -------  * remove all internal uses of pytest_namespace hooks,   this is to prepare the removal of preloadconfig in pytest 4.0   Thanks to :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.  * pytest now warns when a callable ids raises in a parametrized test. Thanks :user:`fogo` for the PR.  * It is now possible to skip test classes from being collected by setting a ``\_\_test\_\_`attribute to`False``in the class body (:issue:`2007`). Thanks   to :user:`syre` for the report and :user:`lwm` for the PR.  * Change junitxml.py to produce reports that comply with Junitxml schema.   If the same test fails with failure in call and then errors in teardown   we split testcase element into two, one containing the error and the other   the failure. (:issue:`2228`) Thanks to :user:`kkoukiou` for the PR.  * Testcase reports with a``url``attribute will now properly write this to junitxml.   Thanks :user:`fushi` for the PR (:pr:`1874`).  * Remove common items from dict comparison output when verbosity=1. Also update   the truncation message to make it clearer that pytest truncates all   assertion messages if verbosity < 2 (:issue:`1512`).   Thanks :user:`mattduck` for the PR  *``--pdbcls`no longer implies`--pdb`. This makes it possible to use`addopts=--pdbcls=module.SomeClass`on`pytest.ini``.

Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and PR.  * Hooks are now verified after collection is complete, rather than right after loading installed plugins. This   makes it easy to write hooks for plugins which will be loaded during collection, for example using the``pytest\_plugins``special variable (:issue:`1821`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Modify``pytest\_make\_parametrize\_id()`hook to accept`argname``as an   additional parameter.   Thanks :user:`unsignedint` for the PR.  * Add``venv`to the default`norecursedirs``setting.

Thanks :user:`ojii` for the PR.  * Replace minor/patch level version numbers in the documentation with placeholders.   This significantly reduces change-noise as different contributors regenerate   the documentation on different platforms.   Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.  * fix :issue:`2391`: consider pytest_plugins on all plugin modules   Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.   Bug Fixes ---------  * Fix``AttributeError`on`sys.stdout.buffer`/`sys.stderr.buffer`while using`capsys``fixture in python 3. (:issue:`1407`).

Thanks :user:`kkoukiou` for the PR.  * Fix regression, pytest now skips unittest correctly if run with``--pdb``(:issue:`2137`). Thanks to :user:`gst` for the report and :user:`mbyt` for the PR.  * Ignore exceptions raised from descriptors (e.g. properties) during Python test collection (:issue:`2234`).   Thanks to :user:`bluetech`.  *``--override-ini`now correctly overrides some fundamental options like`python\_files``(:issue:`2238`).   Thanks :user:`sirex` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Replace``raise StopIteration`usages in the code by simple`returns``to finish generators, in accordance to :pep:`479` (:issue:`2160`).   Thanks to :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix internal errors when an unprintable``AssertionError``is raised inside a test.   Thanks :user:`omerhadari` for the PR.  * Skipping plugin now also works with test items generated by custom collectors (:issue:`2231`).   Thanks to :user:`vidartf`.  * Fix trailing whitespace in console output if no .ini file presented (:issue:`2281`). Thanks :user:`fbjorn` for the PR.  * Conditionless``xfail`markers no longer rely on the underlying test item   being an instance of`PyobjMixin``, and can therefore apply to tests not   collected by the built-in python test collector. Thanks :user:`barneygale` for the   PR.   3.0.6 (2017-01-22) ==================  * pytest no longer generates``PendingDeprecationWarning`from its own operations, which was introduced by mistake in version`3.0.5``(:issue:`2118`).   Thanks to :user:`nicoddemus` for the report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.   * pytest no longer recognizes coroutine functions as yield tests (:issue:`2129`).   Thanks to :user:`malinoff` for the PR.  * Plugins loaded by the``PYTEST\_PLUGINS``environment variable are now automatically   considered for assertion rewriting (:issue:`2185`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Improve error message when pytest.warns fails (:issue:`2150`). The type(s) of the   expected warnings and the list of caught warnings is added to the   error message. Thanks :user:`lesteve` for the PR.  * Fix``pytester`internal plugin to work correctly with latest versions of`zope.interface``(:issue:`1989`). Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Assert statements of the``pytester``plugin again benefit from assertion rewriting (:issue:`1920`).   Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Specifying tests with colons like``test\_foo.py::test\_bar``for tests in   subdirectories with ini configuration files now uses the correct ini file   (:issue:`2148`).  Thanks :user:`pelme`.  * Fail``testdir.runpytest().assert\_outcomes()``explicitly if the pytest   terminal output it relies on is missing. Thanks to :user:`eli-b` for the PR.   3.0.5 (2016-12-05) ==================  * Add warning when not passing``option=value`correctly to`-o/--override-ini``(:issue:`2105`).   Also improved the help documentation. Thanks to :user:`mbukatov` for the report and   :user:`lwm` for the PR.  * Now``--confcutdir`and`--junit-xml``are properly validated if they are directories   and filenames, respectively (:issue:`2089` and :issue:`2078`). Thanks to :user:`lwm` for the PR.  * Add hint to error message hinting possible missing``\_\_init\_\_.py``(:issue:`478`). Thanks :user:`DuncanBetts`.  * More accurately describe when fixture finalization occurs in documentation (:issue:`687`). Thanks :user:`DuncanBetts`.  * Provide``:ref:`targets for`recwarn.rst``so we can use intersphinx referencing.   Thanks to :user:`dupuy` for the report and :user:`lwm` for the PR.  * In Python 2, use a simple``+-`ASCII string in the string representation of`pytest.approx`(for example`"4 +- 4.0e-06"``)   because it is brittle to handle that in different contexts and representations internally in pytest   which can result in bugs such as :issue:`2111`. In Python 3, the representation still uses``±`(for example`4 ± 4.0e-06``).   Thanks :user:`kerrick-lyft` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Using``item.Function`,`item.Module`, etc., is now issuing deprecation warnings, prefer`pytest.Function`,`pytest.Module``, etc., instead (:issue:`2034`).   Thanks :user:`nmundar` for the PR.  * Fix error message using``approx``with complex numbers (:issue:`2082`).   Thanks :user:`adler-j` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules imported more than   once by the``pytest\_plugins``mechanism.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Remove an internal cache which could cause hooks from``conftest.py``files in   sub-directories to be called in other directories incorrectly (:issue:`2016`).   Thanks :user:`d-b-w` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Remove internal code meant to support earlier Python 3 versions that produced the side effect   of leaving``None`in`sys.modules`when expressions were evaluated by pytest (for example passing a condition   as a string to`pytest.mark.skipif``)(:issue:`2103`).   Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Cope gracefully with a .pyc file with no matching .py file (:issue:`2038`). Thanks   :user:`nedbat`.   3.0.4 (2016-11-09) ==================  * Import errors when collecting test modules now display the full traceback (:issue:`1976`).   Thanks :user:`cwitty` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix confusing command-line help message for custom options with two or more``metavar``properties (:issue:`2004`).   Thanks :user:`okulynyak` and :user:`davehunt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * When loading plugins, import errors which contain non-ascii messages are now properly handled in Python 2 (:issue:`1998`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fixed cyclic reference when``pytest.raises``is used in context-manager form (:issue:`1965`). Also as a   result of this fix,``sys.exc\_info()`is left empty in both context-manager and function call usages.   Previously,`sys.exc\_info``would contain the exception caught by the context manager,   even when the expected exception occurred.   Thanks :user:`MSeifert04` for the report and the PR.  * Fixed false-positives warnings from assertion rewrite hook for modules that were rewritten but   were later marked explicitly by``pytest.register\_assert\_rewrite``or implicitly as a plugin (:issue:`2005`).   Thanks :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Report teardown output on test failure (:issue:`442`).   Thanks :user:`matclab` for the PR.  * Fix teardown error message in generated xUnit XML.   Thanks :user:`gdyuldin` for the PR.  * Properly handle exceptions in``multiprocessing``tasks (:issue:`1984`).   Thanks :user:`adborden` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Clean up unittest TestCase objects after tests are complete (:issue:`1649`).   Thanks :user:`d-b-w` for the report and PR.   3.0.3 (2016-09-28) ==================  * The``ids`argument to`parametrize`again accepts`unicode``strings   in Python 2 (:issue:`1905`).   Thanks :user:`philpep` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Assertions are now being rewritten for plugins in development mode   (``pip install -e``) (:issue:`1934`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix pkg_resources import error in Jython projects (:issue:`1853`).   Thanks :user:`raquelalegre` for the PR.  * Got rid of``AttributeError: 'Module' object has no attribute '\_obj'``exception   in Python 3 (:issue:`1944`).   Thanks :user:`axil` for the PR.  * Explain a bad scope value passed to``@fixture`declarations or   a`MetaFunc.parametrize()`call.  * This version includes`pluggy-0.4.0`, which correctly handles`VersionConflict``errors in plugins (:issue:`704`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.   3.0.2 (2016-09-01) ==================  * Improve error message when passing non-string ids to``pytest.mark.parametrize``(:issue:`1857`).   Thanks :user:`okken` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Add``buffer`attribute to stdin stub class`pytest.capture.DontReadFromInput``Thanks :user:`joguSD` for the PR.  * Fix``UnicodeEncodeError``when string comparison with unicode has failed. (:issue:`1864`)   Thanks :user:`AiOO` for the PR.  *``pytest\_plugins`is now handled correctly if defined as a string (as opposed as   a sequence of strings) when modules are considered for assertion rewriting.   Due to this bug, much more modules were being rewritten than necessary   if a test suite uses`pytest\_plugins``to load internal plugins (:issue:`1888`).   Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1891`).  * Do not call tearDown and cleanups when running tests from``unittest.TestCase`subclasses with`--pdb``enabled. This allows proper post mortem debugging for all applications   which have significant logic in their tearDown machinery (:issue:`1890`). Thanks   :user:`mbyt` for the PR.  * Fix use of deprecated``getfuncargvalue``method in the internal doctest plugin.   Thanks :user:`ViviCoder` for the report (:issue:`1898`).   3.0.1 (2016-08-23) ==================  * Fix regression when``importorskip``is used at module level (:issue:`1822`).   Thanks :user:`jaraco` and :user:`The-Compiler` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix parametrization scope when session fixtures are used in conjunction   with normal parameters in the same call (:issue:`1832`).   Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the report, :user:`Kingdread` and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix internal error when parametrizing tests or fixtures using an empty``ids``argument (:issue:`1849`).   Thanks :user:`OPpuolitaival` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix loader error when running``pytest``embedded in a zipfile.   Thanks :user:`mbachry` for the PR.   .. _release-3.0.0:  3.0.0 (2016-08-18) ==================  **Incompatible changes**   A number of incompatible changes were made in this release, with the intent of removing features deprecated for a long time or change existing behaviors in order to make them less surprising/more useful.  * Reinterpretation mode has now been removed.  Only plain and rewrite   mode are available, consequently the``--assert=reinterp`option is   no longer available.  This also means files imported from plugins or`conftest.py`will not benefit from improved assertions by   default, you should use`pytest.register\_assert\_rewrite()``to   explicitly turn on assertion rewriting for those files.  Thanks   :user:`flub` for the PR.  * The following deprecated commandline options were removed:    *``--genscript`: no longer supported;   *`--no-assert`: use`--assert=plain`instead;   *`--nomagic`: use`--assert=plain`instead;   *`--report`: use`-r``instead;    Thanks to :user:`RedBeardCode` for the PR (:pr:`1664`).  * ImportErrors in plugins now are a fatal error instead of issuing a   pytest warning (:issue:`1479`). Thanks to :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.  * Removed support code for Python 3 versions < 3.3 (:pr:`1627`).  * Removed all``py.test-X\*``entry points. The versioned, suffixed entry points   were never documented and a leftover from a pre-virtualenv era. These entry   points also created broken entry points in wheels, so removing them also   removes a source of confusion for users (:issue:`1632`).   Thanks :user:`obestwalter` for the PR.  *``pytest.skip()``now raises an error when used to decorate a test function,   as opposed to its original intent (to imperatively skip a test inside a test function). Previously   this usage would cause the entire module to be skipped (:issue:`607`).   Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1519`).  * Exit tests if a collection error occurs. A poll indicated most users will hit CTRL-C   anyway as soon as they see collection errors, so pytest might as well make that the default behavior (:issue:`1421`).   A``--continue-on-collection-errors``option has been added to restore the previous behaviour.   Thanks :user:`olegpidsadnyi` and :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1628`).  * Renamed the pytest``pdb`module (plugin) into`debugging`to avoid clashes with the builtin`pdb`module.  * Raise a helpful failure message when requesting a parametrized fixture at runtime,   e.g. with`request.getfixturevalue`. Previously these parameters were simply   never defined, so a fixture decorated like`@pytest.fixture(params=\[0, 1, 2\])``only ran once (:pr:`460`).   Thanks to :user:`nikratio` for the bug report, :user:`RedBeardCode` and :user:`tomviner` for the PR.  *``\_pytest.monkeypatch.monkeypatch`class has been renamed to`\_pytest.monkeypatch.MonkeyPatch`so it doesn't conflict with the`monkeypatch`fixture.  *`--exitfirst / -x`can now be overridden by a following`--maxfail=N`and is just a synonym for`--maxfail=1`.   **New Features**  * Support nose-style`\_\_test\_\_`attribute on methods of classes,   including unittest-style Classes. If set to`False`, the test will not be   collected.  * New`doctest\_namespace``fixture for injecting names into the   namespace in which doctests run.   Thanks :user:`milliams` for the complete PR (:pr:`1428`).  * New``--doctest-report``option available to change the output format of diffs   when running (failing) doctests (implements :issue:`1749`).   Thanks :user:`hartym` for the PR.  * New``name`argument to`pytest.fixture``decorator which allows a custom name   for a fixture (to solve the funcarg-shadowing-fixture problem).   Thanks :user:`novas0x2a` for the complete PR (:pr:`1444`).  * New``approx()``function for easily comparing floating-point numbers in   tests.   Thanks :user:`kalekundert` for the complete PR (:pr:`1441`).  * Ability to add global properties in the final xunit output file by accessing   the internal``junitxml``plugin (experimental).   Thanks :user:`tareqalayan` for the complete PR :pr:`1454`).  * New``ExceptionInfo.match()``method to match a regular expression on the   string representation of an exception (:issue:`372`).   Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1502`).  *``\_\_tracebackhide\_\_`can now also be set to a callable which then can decide   whether to filter the traceback based on the`ExceptionInfo``object passed   to it. Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the complete PR (:pr:`1526`).  * New``pytest\_make\_parametrize\_id(config, val)``hook which can be used by plugins to provide   friendly strings for custom types.   Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the PR.  *``capsys`and`capfd`now have a`disabled()``context-manager method, which   can be used to temporarily disable capture within a test.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * New cli flag``--fixtures-per-test`: shows which fixtures are being used   for each selected test item. Features doc strings of fixtures by default.   Can also show where fixtures are defined if combined with`-v``.   Thanks :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.  * Introduce``pytest`command as recommended entry point. Note that`py.test``still works and is not scheduled for removal. Closes proposal   :issue:`1629`. Thanks :user:`obestwalter` and :user:`davehunt` for the complete PR   (:pr:`1633`).  * New cli flags:    +``--setup-plan`: performs normal collection and reports     the potential setup and teardown and does not execute any fixtures and tests;   +`--setup-only`: performs normal collection, executes setup and teardown of     fixtures and reports them;   +`--setup-show`: performs normal test execution and additionally shows     setup and teardown of fixtures;   +`--keep-duplicates`: py.test now ignores duplicated paths given in the command     line. To retain the previous behavior where the same test could be run multiple     times by specifying it in the command-line multiple times, pass the`--keep-duplicates``argument (:issue:`1609`);    Thanks :user:`d6e`, :user:`kvas-it`, :user:`sallner`, :user:`ioggstream` and :user:`omarkohl` for the PRs.  * New CLI flag``--override-ini`/`-o`: overrides values from the ini file.   For example:`"-o xfail\_strict=True"``'.   Thanks :user:`blueyed` and :user:`fengxx` for the PR.  * New hooks:    +``pytest\_fixture\_setup(fixturedef, request)`: executes fixture setup;   +`pytest\_fixture\_post\_finalizer(fixturedef)``: called after the fixture's     finalizer and has access to the fixture's result cache.    Thanks :user:`d6e`, :user:`sallner`.  * Issue warnings for asserts whose test is a tuple literal. Such asserts will   never fail because tuples are always truthy and are usually a mistake   (see :issue:`1562`). Thanks :user:`kvas-it`, for the PR.  * Allow passing a custom debugger class (e.g.``--pdbcls=IPython.core.debugger:Pdb``).   Thanks to :user:`anntzer` for the PR.   **Changes**  * Plugins now benefit from assertion rewriting.  Thanks   :user:`sober7`, :user:`nicoddemus` and :user:`flub` for the PR.  * Change``report.outcome`for`xpassed`tests to`"passed"`in non-strict   mode and`"failed"``in strict mode. Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR   (:pr:`1795`) and :user:`gprasad84` for report (:issue:`1546`).  * Tests marked with``xfail(strict=False)``(the default) now appear in   JUnitXML reports as passing tests instead of skipped.   Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR (:pr:`1795`).  * Highlight path of the file location in the error report to make it easier to copy/paste.   Thanks :user:`suzaku` for the PR (:pr:`1778`).  * Fixtures marked with``@pytest.fixture`can now use`yield`statements exactly like   those marked with the`@pytest.yield\_fixture`decorator. This change renders`@pytest.yield\_fixture`deprecated and makes`@pytest.fixture`with`yield``statements   the preferred way to write teardown code (:pr:`1461`).   Thanks :user:`csaftoiu` for bringing this to attention and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Explicitly passed parametrize ids do not get escaped to ascii (:issue:`1351`).   Thanks :user:`ceridwen` for the PR.  * Fixtures are now sorted in the error message displayed when an unknown   fixture is declared in a test function.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  *``pytest\_terminal\_summary`hook now receives the`exitstatus``of the test session as argument. Thanks :user:`blueyed` for the PR (:pr:`1809`).  * Parametrize ids can accept``None``as specific test id, in which case the   automatically generated id for that argument will be used.   Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1468`).  * The parameter to xunit-style setup/teardown methods (``setup\_method`,`setup\_module``, etc.) is now optional and may be omitted.   Thanks :user:`okken` for bringing this to attention and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Improved automatic id generation selection in case of duplicate ids in   parametrize.   Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1474`).  * Now pytest warnings summary is shown up by default. Added a new flag``--disable-pytest-warnings``to explicitly disable the warnings summary (:issue:`1668`).  * Make ImportError during collection more explicit by reminding   the user to check the name of the test module/package(s) (:issue:`1426`).   Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the complete PR (:pr:`1520`).  * Add``build/`and`dist/`to the default`--norecursedirs``list. Thanks   :user:`mikofski` for the report and :user:`tomviner` for the PR (:issue:`1544`).  *``pytest.raises`in the context manager form accepts a custom`message``to raise when no exception occurred.   Thanks :user:`palaviv` for the complete PR (:pr:`1616`).  *``conftest.py``files now benefit from assertion rewriting; previously it   was only available for test modules. Thanks :user:`flub`, :user:`sober7` and   :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:issue:`1619`).  * Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".   Thanks :user:`graingert` for reporting and providing a full PR (:pr:`1580`).  * Ensure that a module within a namespace package can be found when it   is specified on the command line together with the``--pyargs``option.  Thanks to :user:`taschini` for the PR (:pr:`1597`).  * Always include full assertion explanation during assertion rewriting. The previous behaviour was hiding   sub-expressions that happened to be``False``, assuming this was redundant information.   Thanks :user:`bagerard` for reporting (:issue:`1503`). Thanks to :user:`davehunt` and   :user:`tomviner` for the PR.  *``OptionGroup.addoption()``now checks if option names were already   added before, to make it easier to track down issues like :issue:`1618`.   Before, you only got exceptions later from``argparse`library,   giving no clue about the actual reason for double-added options.  *`yield``-based tests are considered deprecated and will be removed in pytest-4.0.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  *``\[pytest\]`sections in`setup.cfg`files should now be named`\[<tool:pytest>\]``to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands (see :pr:`567`).``\[pytest\]`sections in`pytest.ini`or`tox.ini``files are supported and unchanged.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Using``pytest\_funcarg\_\_``prefix to declare fixtures is considered deprecated and will be   removed in pytest-4.0 (:pr:`1684`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Passing a command-line string to``pytest.main()``is considered deprecated and scheduled   for removal in pytest-4.0. It is recommended to pass a list of arguments instead (:pr:`1723`).  * Rename``getfuncargvalue`to`getfixturevalue`.`getfuncargvalue``is   still present but is now considered deprecated. Thanks to :user:`RedBeardCode` and :user:`tomviner`   for the PR (:pr:`1626`).  *``optparse``type usage now triggers DeprecationWarnings (:issue:`1740`).   *``optparse``backward compatibility supports float/complex types (:issue:`457`).  * Refined logic for determining the``rootdir``, considering only valid   paths which fixes a number of issues: :issue:`1594`, :issue:`1435` and :issue:`1471`.   Updated the documentation according to current behavior. Thanks to   :user:`blueyed`, :user:`davehunt` and :user:`matthiasha` for the PR.  * Always include full assertion explanation. The previous behaviour was hiding   sub-expressions that happened to be False, assuming this was redundant information.   Thanks :user:`bagerard` for reporting (:issue:`1503`). Thanks to :user:`davehunt` and   :user:`tomviner` for PR.  * Better message in case of not using parametrized variable (see :issue:`1539`).   Thanks to :user:`tramwaj29` for the PR.  * Updated docstrings with a more uniform style.  * Add stderr write for``pytest.exit(msg)``during startup. Previously the message was never shown.   Thanks :user:`BeyondEvil` for reporting :issue:`1210`. Thanks to @jgsonesen and   :user:`tomviner` for the PR.  * No longer display the incorrect test deselection reason (:issue:`1372`).   Thanks :user:`ronnypfannschmidt` for the PR.  * The``--resultlog``command line option has been deprecated: it is little used   and there are more modern and better alternatives (see :issue:`830`).   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Improve error message with fixture lookup errors: add an 'E' to the first   line and '>' to the rest. Fixes :issue:`717`. Thanks :user:`blueyed` for reporting and   a PR, :user:`eolo999` for the initial PR and :user:`tomviner` for his guidance during   EuroPython2016 sprint.   **Bug Fixes**  * Parametrize now correctly handles duplicated test ids.  * Fix internal error issue when the``method`argument is missing for`teardown\_method()``(:issue:`1605`).  * Fix exception visualization in case the current working directory (CWD) gets   deleted during testing (:issue:`1235`). Thanks :user:`bukzor` for reporting. PR by   :user:`marscher`.  * Improve test output for logical expression with brackets (:issue:`925`).   Thanks :user:`DRMacIver` for reporting and :user:`RedBeardCode` for the PR.  * Create correct diff for strings ending with newlines (:issue:`1553`).   Thanks :user:`Vogtinator` for reporting and :user:`RedBeardCode` and   :user:`tomviner` for the PR.  *``ConftestImportFailure`now shows the traceback making it easier to   identify bugs in`conftest.py``files (:pr:`1516`). Thanks :user:`txomon` for   the PR.  * Text documents without any doctests no longer appear as "skipped".   Thanks :user:`graingert` for reporting and providing a full PR (:pr:`1580`).  * Fixed collection of classes with custom``\_\_new\_\_``method.   Fixes :issue:`1579`. Thanks to :user:`Stranger6667` for the PR.  * Fixed scope overriding inside metafunc.parametrize (:issue:`634`).   Thanks to :user:`Stranger6667` for the PR.  * Fixed the total tests tally in junit xml output (:pr:`1798`).   Thanks to :user:`cboelsen` for the PR.  * Fixed off-by-one error with lines from``request.node.warn``.   Thanks to :user:`blueyed` for the PR.   2.9.2 (2016-05-31) ==================  **Bug Fixes**  * fix :issue:`510`: skip tests where one parameterize dimension was empty   thanks Alex Stapleton for the Report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR  * Fix Xfail does not work with condition keyword argument.   Thanks :user:`astraw38` for reporting the issue (:issue:`1496`) and :user:`tomviner`   for PR the (:pr:`1524`).  * Fix win32 path issue when putting custom config file with absolute path   in``pytest.main("-c your\_absolute\_path")``.  * Fix maximum recursion depth detection when raised error class is not aware   of unicode/encoded bytes.   Thanks :user:`prusse-martin` for the PR (:pr:`1506`).  * Fix``pytest.mark.skip``mark when used in strict mode.   Thanks :user:`pquentin` for the PR and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for   showing how to fix the bug.  * Minor improvements and fixes to the documentation.   Thanks :user:`omarkohl` for the PR.  * Fix``--fixtures``to show all fixture definitions as opposed to just   one per fixture name.   Thanks to :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.   2.9.1 (2016-03-17) ==================  **Bug Fixes**  * Improve error message when a plugin fails to load.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix (:issue:`1178`):``pytest.fail``with non-ascii characters raises an internal pytest error.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix (:issue:`469`): junit parses report.nodeid incorrectly, when params IDs   contain``::``. Thanks :user:`tomviner` for the PR (:pr:`1431`).  * Fix (:issue:`578`): SyntaxErrors   containing non-ascii lines at the point of failure generated an internal   py.test error.   Thanks :user:`asottile` for the report and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Fix (:issue:`1437`): When passing in a bytestring regex pattern to parameterize   attempt to decode it as utf-8 ignoring errors.  * Fix (:issue:`649`): parametrized test nodes cannot be specified to run on the command line.  * Fix (:issue:`138`): better reporting for python 3.3+ chained exceptions   2.9.0 (2016-02-29) ==================  **New Features**  * New``pytest.mark.skip``mark, which unconditionally skips marked tests.   Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the complete PR (:pr:`1040`).  *``--doctest-glob``may now be passed multiple times in the command-line.   Thanks :user:`jab` and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * New``-rp`and`-rP``reporting options give the summary and full output   of passing tests, respectively. Thanks to :user:`codewarrior0` for the PR.  *``pytest.mark.xfail`now has a`strict`option, which makes`XPASS`tests to fail the test suite (defaulting to`False`). There's also a`xfail\_strict``ini option that can be used to configure it project-wise.   Thanks :user:`rabbbit` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1355`).  *``Parser.addini`now supports options of type`bool``.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * New``ALLOW\_BYTES`doctest option. This strips`b`prefixes from byte strings   in doctest output (similar to`ALLOW\_UNICODE``).   Thanks :user:`jaraco` for the request and :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1287`).  * Give a hint on``KeyboardInterrupt`to use the`--fulltrace``option to show the errors.   Fixes :issue:`1366`.   Thanks to :user:`hpk42` for the report and :user:`RonnyPfannschmidt` for the PR.  * Catch``IndexError``exceptions when getting exception source location.   Fixes a pytest internal error for dynamically generated code (fixtures and tests)   where source lines are fake by intention.  **Changes**  * **Important**: `py.code <https://pylib.readthedocs.io/en/stable/code.html>`_ has been   merged into the``pytest`repository as`pytest.\_code`. This decision   was made because`py.code`had very few uses outside`pytest`and the   fact that it was in a different repository made it difficult to fix bugs on   its code in a timely manner. The team hopes with this to be able to better   refactor out and improve that code.   This change shouldn't affect users, but it is useful to let users aware   if they encounter any strange behavior.    Keep in mind that the code for`pytest.\_code`is **private** and   **experimental**, so you definitely should not import it explicitly!    Please note that the original`py.code``is still available in   `pylib <https://pylib.readthedocs.io>`_.  *``pytest\_enter\_pdb``now optionally receives the pytest config object.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR.  * Removed code and documentation for Python 2.5 or lower versions,   including removal of the obsolete``\_pytest.assertion.oldinterpret``module.   Thanks :user:`nicoddemus` for the PR (:pr:`1226`).  * Comparisons now always show up in full when``CI`or`BUILD\_NUMBER`is   found in the environment, even when`-vv``isn't used.   Thanks :user:`The-Compiler` for the PR.  *``--lf`and`--ff`now support long names:`--last-failed`and`--failed-first``respectively.   Thanks :user:`MichaelAquilina` for the PR.  * Added expected exceptions to``pytest.raises`fail message.  * Collection only displays progress ("collecting X items") when in a terminal.   This avoids cluttering the output when using`--color=yes``to obtain   colors in CI integrations systems (:issue:`1397`).  **Bug Fixes**  * The``-s`and`-c`options should now work under`xdist`;`Config.fromdictargs``now represents its input much more faithfully.   Thanks to :user:`bukzor` for the complete PR (:issue:`680`).  * Fix (:issue:`1290`): support Python 3.5's``@``operator in assertion rewriting.   Thanks :user:`Shinkenjoe` for report with test case and :user:`tomviner` for the PR.  * Fix formatting utf-8 explanation messages (:issue:`1379`).   Thanks :user:`biern` for the PR.  * Fix [traceback style docs <how-to-modifying-python-tb-printing>](#traceback-style-docs-<how-to-modifying-python-tb-printing>) to describe all of the available options   (auto/long/short/line/native/no), with``auto``being the default since v2.6.   Thanks :user:`hackebrot` for the PR.  * Fix (:issue:`1422`): junit record_xml_property doesn't allow multiple records   with same name.   2.8.7 (2016-01-24) ==================  - fix #1338: use predictable object resolution for monkeypatch  2.8.6 (2016-01-21) ==================  - fix #1259: allow for double nodeids in junitxml,   this was a regression failing plugins combinations   like pytest-pep8 + pytest-flakes  - Workaround for exception that occurs in pyreadline when using``--pdb`with standard I/O capture enabled.   Thanks Erik M. Bray for the PR.  - fix #900: Better error message in case the target of a`monkeypatch`call   raises an`ImportError`.  - fix #1292: monkeypatch calls (setattr, setenv, etc.) are now O(1).   Thanks David R. MacIver for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #1223: captured stdout and stderr are now properly displayed before   entering pdb when`--pdb`is used instead of being thrown away.   Thanks Cal Leeming for the PR.  - fix #1305: pytest warnings emitted during`pytest\_terminal\_summary`are now   properly displayed.   Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #628: fixed internal UnicodeDecodeError when doctests contain unicode.   Thanks Jason R. Coombs for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #1334: Add captured stdout to jUnit XML report on setup error.   Thanks Georgy Dyuldin for the PR.   2.8.5 (2015-12-11) ==================  - fix #1243: fixed issue where class attributes injected during collection could break pytest.   PR by Alexei Kozlenok, thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt and Bruno Oliveira for the review and help.  - fix #1074: precompute junitxml chunks instead of storing the whole tree in objects   Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the report and Ronny Pfannschmidt for the PR  - fix #1238: fix`pytest.deprecated\_call()`receiving multiple arguments   (Regression introduced in 2.8.4). Thanks Alex Gaynor for the report and   Bruno Oliveira for the PR.   2.8.4 (2015-12-06) ==================  - fix #1190:`deprecated\_call()`now works when the deprecated   function has been already called by another test in the same   module. Thanks Mikhail Chernykh for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the   PR.  - fix #1198:`--pastebin`option now works on Python 3. Thanks   Mehdy Khoshnoody for the PR.  - fix #1219:`--pastebin`now works correctly when captured output contains   non-ascii characters. Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #1204: another error when collecting with a nasty __getattr__().   Thanks Florian Bruhin for the PR.  - fix the summary printed when no tests did run.   Thanks Florian Bruhin for the PR. - fix #1185 - ensure MANIFEST.in exactly matches what should go to a sdist  - a number of documentation modernizations wrt good practices.   Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  2.8.3 (2015-11-18) ==================  - fix #1169: add __name__ attribute to testcases in TestCaseFunction to   support the @unittest.skip decorator on functions and methods.   Thanks Lee Kamentsky for the PR.  - fix #1035: collecting tests if test module level obj has __getattr__().   Thanks Suor for the report and Bruno Oliveira / Tom Viner for the PR.  - fix #331: don't collect tests if their failure cannot be reported correctly   e.g. they are a callable instance of a class.  - fix #1133: fixed internal error when filtering tracebacks where one entry   belongs to a file which is no longer available.   Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - enhancement made to highlight in red the name of the failing tests so   they stand out in the output.   Thanks Gabriel Reis for the PR.  - add more talks to the documentation - extend documentation on the --ignore cli option - use pytest-runner for setuptools integration - minor fixes for interaction with OS X El Capitan   system integrity protection (thanks Florian)   2.8.2 (2015-10-07) ==================  - fix #1085: proper handling of encoding errors when passing encoded byte   strings to pytest.parametrize in Python 2.   Thanks Themanwithoutaplan for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #1087: handling SystemError when passing empty byte strings to   pytest.parametrize in Python 3.   Thanks Paul Kehrer for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #995: fixed internal error when filtering tracebacks where one entry   was generated by an exec() statement.   Thanks Daniel Hahler, Ashley C Straw, Philippe Gauthier and Pavel Savchenko   for contributing and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix #1100 and #1057: errors when using autouse fixtures and doctest modules.   Thanks Sergey B Kirpichev and Vital Kudzelka for contributing and Bruno   Oliveira for the PR.  2.8.1 (2015-09-29) ==================  - fix #1034: Add missing nodeid on pytest_logwarning call in   addhook.  Thanks Simon Gomizelj for the PR.  - 'deprecated_call' is now only satisfied with a DeprecationWarning or   PendingDeprecationWarning. Before 2.8.0, it accepted any warning, and 2.8.0   made it accept only DeprecationWarning (but not PendingDeprecationWarning).   Thanks Alex Gaynor for the issue and Eric Hunsberger for the PR.  - fix issue #1073: avoid calling __getattr__ on potential plugin objects.   This fixes an incompatibility with pytest-django.  Thanks Andreas Pelme,   Bruno Oliveira and Ronny Pfannschmidt for contributing and Holger Krekel   for the fix.  - Fix issue #704: handle versionconflict during plugin loading more   gracefully.  Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - Fix issue #1064: ""--junitxml" regression when used with the   "pytest-xdist" plugin, with test reports being assigned to the wrong tests.   Thanks Daniel Grunwald for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - (experimental) adapt more SEMVER style versioning and change meaning of   master branch in git repo: "master" branch now keeps the bug fixes, changes   aimed for micro releases.  "features" branch will only be released   with minor or major pytest releases.  - Fix issue #766 by removing documentation references to distutils.   Thanks Russel Winder.  - Fix issue #1030: now byte-strings are escaped to produce item node ids   to make them always serializable.   Thanks Andy Freeland for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - Python 2: if unicode parametrized values are convertible to ascii, their   ascii representation is used for the node id.  - Fix issue #411: Add __eq__ method to assertion comparison example.   Thanks Ben Webb. - Fix issue #653: deprecated_call can be used as context manager.  - fix issue 877: properly handle assertion explanations with non-ascii repr   Thanks Mathieu Agopian for the report and Ronny Pfannschmidt for the PR.  - fix issue 1029: transform errors when writing cache values into pytest-warnings  2.8.0 (2015-09-18) ==================  - new`--lf`and`-ff`options to run only the last failing tests or   "failing tests first" from the last run.  This functionality is provided   through porting the formerly external pytest-cache plugin into pytest core.   BACKWARD INCOMPAT: if you used pytest-cache's functionality to persist   data between test runs be aware that we don't serialize sets anymore.   Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt for most of the merging work.  - "-r" option now accepts "a" to include all possible reports, similar   to passing "fEsxXw" explicitly (issue960).   Thanks Abhijeet Kasurde for the PR.  - avoid python3.5 deprecation warnings by introducing version   specific inspection helpers, thanks Michael Droettboom.  - fix issue562: @nose.tools.istest now fully respected.  - fix issue934: when string comparison fails and a diff is too large to display   without passing -vv, still show a few lines of the diff.   Thanks Florian Bruhin for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix issue736: Fix a bug where fixture params would be discarded when combined   with parametrization markers.   Thanks to Markus Unterwaditzer for the PR.  - fix issue710: introduce ALLOW_UNICODE doctest option: when enabled, the`u`prefix is stripped from unicode strings in expected doctest output. This   allows doctests which use unicode to run in Python 2 and 3 unchanged.   Thanks Jason R. Coombs for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - parametrize now also generates meaningful test IDs for enum, regex and class   objects (as opposed to class instances).   Thanks to Florian Bruhin for the PR.  - Add 'warns' to assert that warnings are thrown (like 'raises').   Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.  - Fix issue683: Do not apply an already applied mark.  Thanks ojake for the PR.  - Deal with capturing failures better so fewer exceptions get lost to   /dev/null.  Thanks David Szotten for the PR.  - fix issue730: deprecate and warn about the --genscript option.   Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt for the report and Christian Pommranz for the PR.  - fix issue751: multiple parametrize with ids bug if it parametrizes class with   two or more test methods. Thanks Sergey Chipiga for reporting and Jan   Bednarik for PR.  - fix issue82: avoid loading conftest files from setup.cfg/pytest.ini/tox.ini   files and upwards by default (--confcutdir can still be set to override this).   Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix issue768: docstrings found in python modules were not setting up session   fixtures. Thanks Jason R. Coombs for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - added`tmpdir\_factory`, a session-scoped fixture that can be used to create   directories under the base temporary directory. Previously this object was   installed as a`\_tmpdirhandler`attribute of the`config`object, but now it   is part of the official API and using`config.\_tmpdirhandler``is   deprecated.   Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix issue808: pytest's internal assertion rewrite hook now implements the   optional :pep:`302` get_data API so tests can access data files next to them.   Thanks xmo-odoo for request and example and Bruno Oliveira for   the PR.  - rootdir and inifile are now displayed during usage errors to help   users diagnose problems such as unexpected ini files which add   unknown options being picked up by pytest. Thanks to Pavel Savchenko for   bringing the problem to attention in #821 and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning   situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,   or no tests were run at all (this is a partial fix for issue500).  - fix issue812: pytest now exits with status code 5 in situations where no   tests were run at all, such as the directory given in the command line does   not contain any tests or as result of a command line option filters   all out all tests (-k for example).   Thanks Eric Siegerman (issue812) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - Summary bar now is colored yellow for warning   situations such as: all tests either were skipped or xpass/xfailed,   or no tests were run at all (related to issue500).   Thanks Eric Siegerman.  - New``testpaths`ini option: list of directories to search for tests   when executing pytest from the root directory. This can be used   to speed up test collection when a project has well specified directories   for tests, being usually more practical than configuring norecursedirs for   all directories that do not contain tests.   Thanks to Adrian for idea (#694) and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.  - fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures.   Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.  - fix issue970: internal pytest warnings now appear as "pytest-warnings" in   the terminal instead of "warnings", so it is clear for users that those   warnings are from pytest and not from the builtin "warnings" module.   Thanks Bruno Oliveira.  - Include setup and teardown in junitxml test durations.   Thanks Janne Vanhala.  - fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+  - new option`--import-mode`to allow to change test module importing   behaviour to append to sys.path instead of prepending.  This better allows   to run test modules against installed versions of a package even if the   package under test has the same import root.  In this example::          testing/__init__.py         testing/test_pkg_under_test.py         pkg_under_test/    the tests will run against the installed version   of pkg_under_test when`--import-mode=append`is used whereas   by default they would always pick up the local version.  Thanks Holger Krekel.  - pytester: add method`TmpTestdir.delete\_loaded\_modules()`, and call it   from`inline\_run()`to allow temporary modules to be reloaded.   Thanks Eduardo Schettino.  - internally refactor pluginmanager API and code so that there   is a clear distinction between a pytest-agnostic rather simple   pluginmanager and the PytestPluginManager which adds a lot of   behaviour, among it handling of the local conftest files.   In terms of documented methods this is a backward compatible   change but it might still break 3rd party plugins which relied on   details like especially the pluginmanager.add_shutdown() API.   Thanks Holger Krekel.  - pluginmanagement: introduce`pytest.hookimpl`and`pytest.hookspec`decorators for setting impl/spec   specific parameters.  This substitutes the previous   now deprecated use of`pytest.mark`which is meant to   contain markers for test functions only.  - write/refine docs for "writing plugins" which now have their   own page and are separate from the "using/installing plugins` page.

  - fix issue732: properly unregister plugins from any hook calling sites allowing to have temporary plugins during test execution.
  - deprecate and warn about `__multicall__` argument in hook implementations. Use the `hookwrapper` mechanism instead already introduced with pytest-2.7.
  - speed up pytest's own test suite considerably by using inprocess tests by default (testrun can be modified with --runpytest=subprocess to create subprocesses in many places instead). The main APIs to run pytest in a test is "runpytest()" or "runpytest\_subprocess" and "runpytest\_inprocess" if you need a particular way of running the test. In all cases you get back a RunResult but the inprocess one will also have a "reprec" attribute with the recorded events/reports.
  - fix monkeypatch.setattr("x.y", raising=False) to actually not raise if "y" is not a preexisting attribute. Thanks Florian Bruhin.
  - fix issue741: make running output from testdir.run copy/pasteable Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - add a new `--noconftest` argument which ignores all `conftest.py` files.
  - add `file` and `line` attributes to JUnit-XML output.
  - fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from `txt` to `rst`. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.
  - fix issue714: add ability to apply indirect=True parameter on particular argnames. Thanks Elizaveta239.
  - fix issue890: changed extension of all documentation files from `txt` to `rst`. Thanks to Abhijeet for the PR.
  - fix issue957: "\# doctest: SKIP" option will now register doctests as SKIPPED rather than PASSED. Thanks Thomas Grainger for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - issue951: add new record\_xml\_property fixture, that supports logging additional information on xml output. Thanks David Diaz for the PR.
  - issue949: paths after normal options (for example `-s`, `-v`, etc) are now properly used to discover `rootdir` and `ini` files. Thanks Peter Lauri for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

### 2.7.3 (2015-09-15)

  - Allow 'dev', 'rc', or other non-integer version strings in `importorskip`. Thanks to Eric Hunsberger for the PR.
  - fix issue856: consider --color parameter in all outputs (for example --fixtures). Thanks Barney Gale for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue855: passing str objects as `plugins` argument to pytest.main is now interpreted as a module name to be imported and registered as a plugin, instead of silently having no effect. Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue744: fix for ast.Call changes in Python 3.5+. Thanks Guido van Rossum, Matthias Bussonnier, Stefan Zimmermann and Thomas Kluyver.
  - fix issue842: applying markers in classes no longer propagate this markers to superclasses which also have markers. Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - preserve warning functions after call to pytest.deprecated\_call. Thanks Pieter Mulder for PR.
  - fix issue854: autouse yield\_fixtures defined as class members of unittest.TestCase subclasses now work as expected. Thanks xmo-odoo for the report and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue833: --fixtures now shows all fixtures of collected test files, instead of just the fixtures declared on the first one. Thanks Florian Bruhin for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue863: skipped tests now report the correct reason when a skip/xfail condition is met when using multiple markers. Thanks Raphael Pierzina for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - optimized tmpdir fixture initialization, which should make test sessions faster (specially when using pytest-xdist). The only visible effect is that now pytest uses a subdirectory in the $TEMP directory for all directories created by this fixture (defaults to $TEMP/pytest-$USER). Thanks Bruno Oliveira for the PR.

### 2.7.2 (2015-06-23)

  - fix issue767: pytest.raises value attribute does not contain the exception instance on Python 2.6. Thanks Eric Siegerman for providing the test case and Bruno Oliveira for PR.
  - Automatically create directory for junitxml and results log. Thanks Aron Curzon.
  - fix issue713: JUnit XML reports for doctest failures. Thanks Punyashloka Biswal.
  - fix issue735: assertion failures on debug versions of Python 3.4+ Thanks Benjamin Peterson.
  - fix issue114: skipif marker reports to internal skipping plugin; Thanks Floris Bruynooghe for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue748: unittest.SkipTest reports to internal pytest unittest plugin. Thanks Thomas De Schampheleire for reporting and Bruno Oliveira for the PR.
  - fix issue718: failed to create representation of sets containing unsortable elements in python 2. Thanks Edison Gustavo Muenz.
  - fix issue756, fix issue752 (and similar issues): depend on py-1.4.29 which has a refined algorithm for traceback generation.

### 2.7.1 (2015-05-19)

  - fix issue731: do not get confused by the braces which may be present and unbalanced in an object's repr while collapsing False explanations. Thanks Carl Meyer for the report and test case.
  - fix issue553: properly handling inspect.getsourcelines failures in FixtureLookupError which would lead to an internal error, obfuscating the original problem. Thanks talljosh for initial diagnose/patch and Bruno Oliveira for final patch.
  - fix issue660: properly report scope-mismatch-access errors independently from ordering of fixture arguments. Also avoid the pytest internal traceback which does not provide information to the user. Thanks Holger Krekel.
  - streamlined and documented release process. Also all versions (in setup.py and documentation generation) are now read from \_pytest/\_\_init\_\_.py. Thanks Holger Krekel.
  - fixed docs to remove the notion that yield-fixtures are experimental. They are here to stay :) Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - Support building wheels by using environment markers for the requirements. Thanks Ionel Maries Cristian.
  - fixed regression to 2.6.4 which surfaced e.g. in lost stdout capture printing when tests raised SystemExit. Thanks Holger Krekel.
  - reintroduced \_pytest fixture of the pytester plugin which is used at least by pytest-xdist.

### 2.7.0 (2015-03-26)

  - fix issue435: make reload() work when assert rewriting is active. Thanks Daniel Hahler.
  - fix issue616: conftest.py files and their contained fixtures are now properly considered for visibility, independently from the exact current working directory and test arguments that are used. Many thanks to Eric Siegerman and his PR235 which contains systematic tests for conftest visibility and now passes. This change also introduces the concept of a `rootdir` which is printed as a new pytest header and documented in the pytest customize web page.
  - change reporting of "diverted" tests, i.e. tests that are collected in one file but actually come from another (e.g. when tests in a test class come from a base class in a different file). We now show the nodeid and indicate via a postfix the other file.
  - add ability to set command line options by environment variable PYTEST\_ADDOPTS.
  - added documentation on the new pytest-dev teams on bitbucket and github. See <https://pytest.org/en/stable/contributing.html> . Thanks to Anatoly for pushing and initial work on this.
  - fix issue650: new option `--doctest-ignore-import-errors` which will turn import errors in doctests into skips. Thanks Charles Cloud for the complete PR.
  - fix issue655: work around different ways that cause python2/3 to leak sys.exc\_info into fixtures/tests causing failures in 3rd party code
  - fix issue615: assertion rewriting did not correctly escape % signs when formatting boolean operations, which tripped over mixing booleans with modulo operators. Thanks to Tom Viner for the report, triaging and fix.
  - implement issue351: add ability to specify parametrize ids as a callable to generate custom test ids. Thanks Brianna Laugher for the idea and implementation.
  - introduce and document new hookwrapper mechanism useful for plugins which want to wrap the execution of certain hooks for their purposes. This supersedes the undocumented `__multicall__` protocol which pytest itself and some external plugins use. Note that pytest-2.8 is scheduled to drop supporting the old `__multicall__` and only support the hookwrapper protocol.
  - majorly speed up invocation of plugin hooks
  - use hookwrapper mechanism in builtin pytest plugins.
  - add a doctest ini option for doctest flags, thanks Holger Peters.
  - add note to docs that if you want to mark a parameter and the parameter is a callable, you also need to pass in a reason to disambiguate it from the "decorator" case. Thanks Tom Viner.
  - "python\_classes" and "python\_functions" options now support glob-patterns for test discovery, as discussed in issue600. Thanks Ldiary Translations.
  - allow to override parametrized fixtures with non-parametrized ones and vice versa (bubenkoff).
  - fix issue463: raise specific error for 'parameterize' misspelling (pfctdayelise).
  - On failure, the `sys.last_value`, `sys.last_type` and `sys.last_traceback` are set, so that a user can inspect the error via postmortem debugging (almarklein).

### 2.6.4 (2014-10-24)

  - Improve assertion failure reporting on iterables, by using ndiff and pprint.
  - removed outdated japanese docs from source tree.
  - docs for "pytest\_addhooks" hook. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - updated plugin index docs. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - fix issue557: with "-k" we only allow the old style "-" for negation at the beginning of strings and even that is deprecated. Use "not" instead. This should allow to pick parametrized tests where "-" appeared in the parameter.
  - fix issue604: Escape % character in the assertion message.
  - fix issue620: add explanation in the --genscript target about what the binary blob means. Thanks Dinu Gherman.
  - fix issue614: fixed pastebin support.
  - fix issue620: add explanation in the --genscript target about what the binary blob means. Thanks Dinu Gherman.
  - fix issue614: fixed pastebin support.

### 2.6.3 (2014-09-24)

  - fix issue575: xunit-xml was reporting collection errors as failures instead of errors, thanks Oleg Sinyavskiy.
  - fix issue582: fix setuptools example, thanks Laszlo Papp and Ronny Pfannschmidt.
  - Fix infinite recursion bug when pickling capture.EncodedFile, thanks Uwe Schmitt.
  - fix issue589: fix bad interaction with numpy and others when showing exceptions. Check for precise "maximum recursion depth exceed" exception instead of presuming any RuntimeError is that one (implemented in py dep). Thanks Charles Cloud for analysing the issue.
  - fix conftest related fixture visibility issue: when running with a CWD outside of a test package pytest would get fixture discovery wrong. Thanks to Wolfgang Schnerring for figuring out a reproducible example.
  - Introduce pytest\_enter\_pdb hook (needed e.g. by pytest\_timeout to cancel the timeout when interactively entering pdb). Thanks Wolfgang Schnerring.
  - check xfail/skip also with non-python function test items. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.

### 2.6.2 (2014-09-05)

  - Added function pytest.freeze\_includes(), which makes it easy to embed pytest into executables using tools like cx\_freeze. See docs for examples and rationale. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - Improve assertion rewriting cache invalidation precision.
  - fixed issue561: adapt autouse fixture example for python3.
  - fixed issue453: assertion rewriting issue with \_\_repr\_\_ containing "n{", "n}" and "n\~".
  - fix issue560: correctly display code if an "else:" or "finally:" is followed by statements on the same line.
  - Fix example in monkeypatch documentation, thanks t-8ch.
  - fix issue572: correct tmpdir doc example for python3.
  - Do not mark as universal wheel because Python 2.6 is different from other builds due to the extra argparse dependency. Fixes issue566. Thanks sontek.
  - Implement issue549: user-provided assertion messages now no longer replace the py.test introspection message but are shown in addition to them.

### 2.6.1 (2014-08-07)

  - No longer show line numbers in the --verbose output, the output is now purely the nodeid. The line number is still shown in failure reports. Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - fix issue437 where assertion rewriting could cause pytest-xdist worker nodes to collect different tests. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.
  - fix issue555: add "errors" attribute to capture-streams to satisfy some distutils and possibly other code accessing sys.stdout.errors.
  - fix issue547 capsys/capfd also work when output capturing ("-s") is disabled.
  - address issue170: allow pytest.mark.xfail(...) to specify expected exceptions via an optional "raises=EXC" argument where EXC can be a single exception or a tuple of exception classes. Thanks David Mohr for the complete PR.
  - fix integration of pytest with unittest.mock.patch decorator when it uses the "new" argument. Thanks Nicolas Delaby for test and PR.
  - fix issue with detecting conftest files if the arguments contain "::" node id specifications (copy pasted from "-v" output)
  - fix issue544 by only removing "@NUM" at the end of "::" separated parts and if the part has a ".py" extension
  - don't use py.std import helper, rather import things directly. Thanks Bruno Oliveira.

### 2.6

  - Cache exceptions from fixtures according to their scope (issue 467).
  - fix issue537: Avoid importing old assertion reinterpretation code by default.
  - fix issue364: shorten and enhance tracebacks representation by default. The new "--tb=auto" option (default) will only display long tracebacks for the first and last entry. You can get the old behaviour of printing all entries as long entries with "--tb=long". Also short entries by default are now printed very similarly to "--tb=native" ones.
  - fix issue514: teach assertion reinterpretation about private class attributes
  - change -v output to include full node IDs of tests. Users can copy a node ID from a test run, including line number, and use it as a positional argument in order to run only a single test.
  - fix issue 475: fail early and comprehensible if calling pytest.raises with wrong exception type.
  - fix issue516: tell in getting-started about current dependencies.
  - cleanup setup.py a bit and specify supported versions. Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the PR.
  - change XPASS colour to yellow rather than red when tests are run with -v.
  - fix issue473: work around mock putting an unbound method into a class dict when double-patching.
  - fix issue498: if a fixture finalizer fails, make sure that the fixture is still invalidated.
  - fix issue453: the result of the pytest\_assertrepr\_compare hook now gets it's newlines escaped so that format\_exception does not blow up.
  - internal new warning system: pytest will now produce warnings when it detects oddities in your test collection or execution. Warnings are ultimately sent to a new pytest\_logwarning hook which is currently only implemented by the terminal plugin which displays warnings in the summary line and shows more details when -rw (report on warnings) is specified.
  - change skips into warnings for test classes with an \_\_init\_\_ and callables in test modules which look like a test but are not functions.
  - fix issue436: improved finding of initial conftest files from command line arguments by using the result of parse\_known\_args rather than the previous flaky heuristics. Thanks Marc Abramowitz for tests and initial fixing approaches in this area.
  - fix issue \#479: properly handle nose/unittest(2) SkipTest exceptions during collection/loading of test modules. Thanks to Marc Schlaich for the complete PR.
  - fix issue490: include pytest\_load\_initial\_conftests in documentation and improve docstring.
  - fix issue472: clarify that `pytest.config.getvalue()` cannot work if it's triggered ahead of command line parsing.

  - fix issue412: messing with stdout/stderr FD-level streams is now captured without crashes.
  - fix issue483: trial/py33 works now properly. Thanks Daniel Grana for PR.
  - improve example for pytest integration with "python setup.py test" which now has a generic "-a" or "--pytest-args" option where you can pass additional options as a quoted string. Thanks Trevor Bekolay.
  - simplified internal capturing mechanism and made it more robust against tests or setups changing FD1/FD2, also better integrated now with pytest.pdb() in single tests.
  - improvements to pytest's own test-suite leakage detection, courtesy of PRs from Marc Abramowitz

  - support nose-style `__test__` attribute on modules, classes and functions, including unittest-style Classes. If set to False, the test will not be collected.
  - fix issue512: show "\<notset\>" for arguments which might not be set in monkeypatch plugin. Improves output in documentation.

### 2.5.2 (2014-01-29)

  - fix issue409 -- better interoperate with cx\_freeze by not trying to import from collections.abc which causes problems for py27/cx\_freeze. Thanks Wolfgang L. for reporting and tracking it down.
  - fixed docs and code to use "pytest" instead of "py.test" almost everywhere. Thanks Jurko Gospodnetic for the complete PR.
  - fix issue425: mention at end of "py.test -h" that --markers and --fixtures work according to specified test path (or current dir)
  - fix issue413: exceptions with unicode attributes are now printed correctly also on python2 and with pytest-xdist runs. (the fix requires py-1.4.20)

  - make capfd/capsys.capture private, its unused and shouldn't be exposed

### 2.5.1 (2013-12-17)

  - merge new documentation styling PR from Tobias Bieniek.
  - fix issue403: allow parametrize of multiple same-name functions within a collection node. Thanks Andreas Kloeckner and Alex Gaynor for reporting and analysis.
  - Allow parameterized fixtures to specify the ID of the parameters by adding an ids argument to pytest.fixture() and pytest.yield\_fixture(). Thanks Floris Bruynooghe.
  - fix issue404 by always using the binary xml escape in the junitxml plugin. Thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt.
  - fix issue407: fix addoption docstring to point to argparse instead of optparse. Thanks Daniel D. Wright.

### 2.5.0 (2013-12-12)

  - dropped python2.5 from automated release testing of pytest itself which means it's probably going to break soon (but still works with this release we believe).

  - simplified and fixed implementation for calling finalizers when parametrized fixtures or function arguments are involved. finalization is now performed lazily at setup time instead of in the "teardown phase". While this might sound odd at first, it helps to ensure that we are correctly handling setup/teardown even in complex code. User-level code should not be affected unless it's implementing the pytest\_runtest\_teardown hook and expecting certain fixture instances are torn down within (very unlikely and would have been unreliable anyway).

  - PR90: add --color=yesauto option to force terminal coloring mode ("auto" is default). Thanks Marc Abramowitz.

  - fix issue319 - correctly show unicode in assertion errors. Many thanks to Floris Bruynooghe for the complete PR. Also means we depend on py\>=1.4.19 now.

  - fix issue396 - correctly sort and finalize class-scoped parametrized tests independently from number of methods on the class.

  - refix issue323 in a better way -- parametrization should now never cause Runtime Recursion errors because the underlying algorithm for re-ordering tests per-scope/per-fixture is not recursive anymore (it was tail-call recursive before which could lead to problems for more than \>966 non-function scoped parameters).

  - fix issue290 - there is preliminary support now for parametrizing with repeated same values (sometimes useful to test if calling a second time works as with the first time).

  - close issue240 - document precisely how pytest module importing works, discuss the two common test directory layouts, and how it interacts with `420`-namespace packages.

  - fix issue246 fix finalizer order to be LIFO on independent fixtures depending on a parametrized higher-than-function scoped fixture. (was quite some effort so please bear with the complexity of this sentence :) Thanks Ralph Schmitt for the precise failure example.

  - fix issue244 by implementing special index for parameters to only use indices for parametrized test ids

  - fix issue287 by running all finalizers but saving the exception from the first failing finalizer and re-raising it so teardown will still have failed. We reraise the first failing exception because it might be the cause for other finalizers to fail.

  - fix ordering when mock.patch or other standard decorator-wrappings are used with test methods. This fixes issue346 and should help with random "xdist" collection failures. Thanks to Ronny Pfannschmidt and Donald Stufft for helping to isolate it.

  - fix issue357 - special case "-k" expressions to allow for filtering with simple strings that are not valid python expressions. Examples: "-k 1.3" matches all tests parametrized with 1.3. "-k None" filters all tests that have "None" in their name and conversely "-k 'not None'". Previously these examples would raise syntax errors.

  - fix issue384 by removing the trial support code since the unittest compat enhancements allow trial to handle it on its own

  - don't hide an ImportError when importing a plugin produces one. fixes issue375.

  - fix issue275 - allow usefixtures and autouse fixtures for running doctest text files.

  - fix issue380 by making --resultlog only rely on longrepr instead of the "reprcrash" attribute which only exists sometimes.

  - address issue122: allow @pytest.fixture(params=iterator) by exploding into a list early on.

  - fix pexpect-3.0 compatibility for pytest's own tests. (fixes issue386)

  - allow nested parametrize-value markers, thanks James Lan for the PR.

  - fix unicode handling with new monkeypatch.setattr(import\_path, value) API. Thanks Rob Dennis. Fixes issue371.

  - fix unicode handling with junitxml, fixes issue368.

  - In assertion rewriting mode on Python 2, fix the detection of coding cookies. See issue \#330.

  - make "--runxfail" turn imperative pytest.xfail calls into no ops (it already did neutralize pytest.mark.xfail markers)

  - refine pytest / pkg\_resources interactions: The AssertionRewritingHook `302` compliant loader now registers itself with setuptools/pkg\_resources properly so that the pkg\_resources.resource\_stream method works properly. Fixes issue366. Thanks for the investigations and full PR to Jason R. Coombs.

  - pytestconfig fixture is now session-scoped as it is the same object during the whole test run. Fixes issue370.

  - avoid one surprising case of marker malfunction/confusion:
    
        @pytest.mark.some(lambda arg: ...)
        def test_function():
    
    would not work correctly because pytest assumes @pytest.mark.some gets a function to be decorated already. We now at least detect if this arg is a lambda and thus the example will work. Thanks Alex Gaynor for bringing it up.

  - xfail a test on pypy that checks wrong encoding/ascii (pypy does not error out). fixes issue385.

  - internally make varnames() deal with classes's \_\_init\_\_, although it's not needed by pytest itself atm. Also fix caching. Fixes issue376.

  - fix issue221 - handle importing of namespace-package with no \_\_init\_\_.py properly.

  - refactor internal FixtureRequest handling to avoid monkeypatching. One of the positive user-facing effects is that the "request" object can now be used in closures.

  - fixed version comparison in pytest.importskip(modname, minverstring)

  - fix issue377 by clarifying in the nose-compat docs that pytest does not duplicate the unittest-API into the "plain" namespace.

  - fix verbose reporting for @mock'd test functions

### 2.4.2 (2013-10-04)

  - on Windows require colorama and a newer py lib so that py.io.TerminalWriter() now uses colorama instead of its own ctypes hacks. (fixes issue365) thanks Paul Moore for bringing it up.
  - fix "-k" matching of tests where "repr" and "attr" and other names would cause wrong matches because of an internal implementation quirk (don't ask) which is now properly implemented. fixes issue345.
  - avoid tmpdir fixture to create too long filenames especially when parametrization is used (issue354)
  - fix pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes / pytest interactions (collection names in mark plugin was assuming an item always has a function which is not true for those plugins etc.) Thanks Andi Zeidler.
  - introduce node.get\_marker/node.add\_marker API for plugins like pytest-pep8 and pytest-flakes to avoid the messy details of the node.keywords pseudo-dicts. Adapted docs.
  - remove attempt to "dup" stdout at startup as it's icky. the normal capturing should catch enough possibilities of tests messing up standard FDs.
  - add pluginmanager.do\_configure(config) as a link to config.do\_configure() for plugin-compatibility

### 2.4.1 (2013-10-02)

  - When using parser.addoption() unicode arguments to the "type" keyword should also be converted to the respective types. thanks Floris Bruynooghe, @dnozay. (fixes issue360 and issue362)
  - fix dotted filename completion when using argcomplete thanks Anthon van der Neuth. (fixes issue361)
  - fix regression when a 1-tuple ("arg",) is used for specifying parametrization (the values of the parametrization were passed nested in a tuple). Thanks Donald Stufft.
  - merge doc typo fixes, thanks Andy Dirnberger

### 2.4

known incompatibilities:

  - if calling --genscript from python2.7 or above, you only get a standalone script which works on python2.7 or above. Use Python2.6 to also get a python2.5 compatible version.
  - all xunit-style teardown methods (nose-style, pytest-style, unittest-style) will not be called if the corresponding setup method failed, see issue322 below.
  - the pytest\_plugin\_unregister hook wasn't ever properly called and there is no known implementation of the hook - so it got removed.
  - pytest.fixture-decorated functions cannot be generators (i.e. use yield) anymore. This change might be reversed in 2.4.1 if it causes unforeseen real-life issues. However, you can always write and return an inner function/generator and change the fixture consumer to iterate over the returned generator. This change was done in lieu of the new `pytest.yield_fixture` decorator, see below.

new features:

  - experimentally introduce a new `pytest.yield_fixture` decorator which accepts exactly the same parameters as pytest.fixture but mandates a `yield` statement instead of a `return statement` from fixture functions. This allows direct integration with "with-style" context managers in fixture functions and generally avoids registering of finalization callbacks in favour of treating the "after-yield" as teardown code. Thanks Andreas Pelme, Vladimir Keleshev, Floris Bruynooghe, Ronny Pfannschmidt and many others for discussions.

  - allow boolean expression directly with skipif/xfail if a "reason" is also specified. Rework skipping documentation to recommend "condition as booleans" because it prevents surprises when importing markers between modules. Specifying conditions as strings will remain fully supported.

  - reporting: color the last line red or green depending if failures/errors occurred or everything passed. thanks Christian Theunert.

  - make "import pdb ; pdb.set\_trace()" work natively wrt capturing (no "-s" needed anymore), making `pytest.set_trace()` a mere shortcut.

  - fix issue181: --pdb now also works on collect errors (and on internal errors) . This was implemented by a slight internal refactoring and the introduction of a new hook `pytest_exception_interact` hook (see next item).

  - fix issue341: introduce new experimental hook for IDEs/terminals to intercept debugging: `pytest_exception_interact(node, call, report)`.

  - new monkeypatch.setattr() variant to provide a shorter invocation for patching out classes/functions from modules:
    
    > monkeypatch.setattr("requests.get", myfunc)
    
    will replace the "get" function of the "requests" module with `myfunc`.

  - fix issue322: tearDownClass is not run if setUpClass failed. Thanks Mathieu Agopian for the initial fix. Also make all of pytest/nose finalizer mimic the same generic behaviour: if a setupX exists and fails, don't run teardownX. This internally introduces a new method "node.addfinalizer()" helper which can only be called during the setup phase of a node.

  - simplify pytest.mark.parametrize() signature: allow to pass a CSV-separated string to specify argnames. For example: `pytest.mark.parametrize("input,expected",  [(1,2), (2,3)])` works as well as the previous: `pytest.mark.parametrize(("input", "expected"), ...)`.

  - add support for setUpModule/tearDownModule detection, thanks Brian Okken.

  - integrate tab-completion on options through use of "argcomplete". Thanks Anthon van der Neut for the PR.

  - change option names to be hyphen-separated long options but keep the old spelling backward compatible. py.test -h will only show the hyphenated version, for example "--collect-only" but "--collectonly" will remain valid as well (for backward-compat reasons). Many thanks to Anthon van der Neut for the implementation and to Hynek Schlawack for pushing us.

  - fix issue 308 - allow to mark/xfail/skip individual parameter sets when parametrizing. Thanks Brianna Laugher.

  - call new experimental pytest\_load\_initial\_conftests hook to allow 3rd party plugins to do something before a conftest is loaded.

Bug fixes:

  - fix issue358 - capturing options are now parsed more properly by using a new parser.parse\_known\_args method.
  - pytest now uses argparse instead of optparse (thanks Anthon) which means that "argparse" is added as a dependency if installing into python2.6 environments or below.
  - fix issue333: fix a case of bad unittest/pytest hook interaction.
  - PR27: correctly handle nose.SkipTest during collection. Thanks Antonio Cuni, Ronny Pfannschmidt.
  - fix issue355: junitxml puts name="pytest" attribute to testsuite tag.
  - fix issue336: autouse fixture in plugins should work again.

  - fix issue317: assertion rewriter support for the is\_package method
  - fix issue335: document py.code.ExceptionInfo() object returned from pytest.raises(), thanks Mathieu Agopian.
  - remove implicit distribute\_setup support from setup.py.
  - fix issue305: ignore any problems when writing pyc files.
  - SO-17664702: call fixture finalizers even if the fixture function partially failed (finalizers would not always be called before)
  - fix issue320 - fix class scope for fixtures when mixed with module-level functions. Thanks Anatoly Bubenkoff.
  - you can specify "-q" or "-qq" to get different levels of "quieter" reporting (thanks Katarzyna Jachim)
  - fix issue300 - Fix order of conftest loading when starting py.test in a subdirectory.
  - fix issue323 - sorting of many module-scoped arg parametrizations
  - make sessionfinish hooks execute with the same cwd-context as at session start (helps fix plugin behaviour which write output files with relative path such as pytest-cov)
  - fix issue316 - properly reference collection hooks in docs
  - fix issue 306 - cleanup of -k/-m options to only match markers/test names/keywords respectively. Thanks Wouter van Ackooy.
  - improved doctest counting for doctests in python modules --files without any doctest items will not show up anymore and doctest examples are counted as separate test items. thanks Danilo Bellini.
  - fix issue245 by depending on the released py-1.4.14 which fixes py.io.dupfile to work with files with no mode. Thanks Jason R. Coombs.
  - fix junitxml generation when test output contains control characters, addressing issue267, thanks Jaap Broekhuizen
  - fix issue338: honor --tb style for setup/teardown errors as well. Thanks Maho.
  - fix issue307 - use yaml.safe\_load in example, thanks Mark Eichin.
  - better parametrize error messages, thanks Brianna Laugher
  - pytest\_terminal\_summary(terminalreporter) hooks can now use ".section(title)" and ".line(msg)" methods to print extra information at the end of a test run.

### 2.3.5 (2013-04-30)

  - fix issue169: respect --tb=style with setup/teardown errors as well.
  - never consider a fixture function for test function collection

  - fix issue266 - accept unicode in MarkEvaluator expressions

### 2.3.4 (2012-11-20)

  - yielded test functions will now have autouse-fixtures active but cannot accept fixtures as funcargs - it's anyway recommended to rather use the post-2.0 parametrize features instead of yield, see: <http://pytest.org/en/stable/example/how-to/parametrize.html>
  - fix autouse-issue where autouse-fixtures would not be discovered if defined in an a/conftest.py file and tests in a/tests/test\_some.py

  - make "-k" accept an expressions the same as with "-m" so that one can write: -k "name1 or name2" etc. This is a slight incompatibility if you used special syntax like "TestClass.test\_method" which you now need to write as -k "TestClass and test\_method" to match a certain method in a certain test class.

### 2.3.3 (2012-11-06)

  - fix issue214 - parse modules that contain special objects like e. g. flask's request object which blows up on getattr access if no request is active. thanks Thomas Waldmann.

  - in tracebacks *,*\* arg values are now shown next to normal arguments (thanks Manuel Jacob)
  - fix issue217 - support mock.patch with pytest's fixtures - note that you need either mock-1.0.1 or the python3.3 builtin unittest.mock.
  - fix issue127 - improve documentation for pytest\_addoption() and add a `config.getoption(name)` helper function for consistency.

  - improve trial support: don't collect its empty unittest.TestCase.runTest() method
  - "python setup.py test" now works with pytest itself
  - fix/improve internal/packaging related bits:
      - exception message check of test\_nose.py now passes on python33 as well
      - issue206 - fix test\_assertrewrite.py to work when a global PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1 is present
      - add tox.ini to pytest distribution so that ignore-dirs and others config bits are properly distributed for maintainers who run pytest-own tests

### 2.3.1 (2012-10-20)

  - fix issue202 - fix regression: using "self" from fixture functions now works as expected (it's the same "self" instance that a test method which uses the fixture sees)
  - skip pexpect using tests (test\_pdb.py mostly) on freebsd\* systems due to pexpect not supporting it properly (hanging)
  - link to web pages from --markers output which provides help for pytest.mark.\* usage.

  - fix "python setup.py test" example to cause a proper "errno" return

  - fix issue165 - fix broken doc links and mention stackoverflow for FAQ

  - catch unicode-issues when writing failure representations to terminal to prevent the whole session from crashing

  - fix xfail/skip confusion: a skip-mark or an imperative pytest.skip will now take precedence before xfail-markers because we can't determine xfail/xpass status in case of a skip. see also: <http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11105828/in-py-test-when-i-explicitly-skip-a-test-that-is-marked-as-xfail-how-can-i-get>

  - always report installed 3rd party plugins in the header of a test run

  - fix issue128: show captured output when capsys/capfd are used

  - fix issue179: properly show the dependency chain of factories

  - pluginmanager.register(...) now raises ValueError if the plugin has been already registered or the name is taken

  - fix issue159: improve <https://docs.pytest.org/en/6.0.1/faq.html> especially with respect to the "magic" history, also mention pytest-django, trial and unittest integration.

  - make request.keywords and node.keywords writable. All descendant collection nodes will see keyword values. Keywords are dictionaries containing markers and other info.

  - fix issue 156: monkeypatch correctly handles class level descriptors

  - reporting refinements:
    
      - pytest\_report\_header now receives a "startdir" so that you can use startdir.bestrelpath(yourpath) to show nice relative path
      - allow plugins to implement both pytest\_report\_header and pytest\_sessionstart (sessionstart is invoked first).
      - don't show deselected reason line if there is none
      - py.test -vv will show all of assert comparisons instead of truncating

### 2.2.1 (2011-12-16)

  - fix issue99 (in pytest and py) internallerrors with resultlog now produce better output - fixed by normalizing pytest\_internalerror input arguments.
  - fix issue97 / traceback issues (in pytest and py) improve traceback output in conjunction with jinja2 and cython which hack tracebacks
  - fix issue93 (in pytest and pytest-xdist) avoid "delayed teardowns": the final test in a test node will now run its teardown directly instead of waiting for the end of the session. Thanks Dave Hunt for the good reporting and feedback. The pytest\_runtest\_protocol as well as the pytest\_runtest\_teardown hooks now have "nextitem" available which will be None indicating the end of the test run.
  - fix collection crash due to unknown-source collected items, thanks to Ralf Schmitt (fixed by depending on a more recent pylib)

### 2.2.0 (2011-11-18)

  - fix issue90: introduce eager tearing down of test items so that teardown function are called earlier.
  - add an all-powerful metafunc.parametrize function which allows to parametrize test function arguments in multiple steps and therefore from independent plugins and places.
  - add a @pytest.mark.parametrize helper which allows to easily call a test function with different argument values
  - Add examples to the "parametrize" example page, including a quick port of Test scenarios and the new parametrize function and decorator.
  - introduce registration for "pytest.mark.\*" helpers via ini-files or through plugin hooks. Also introduce a "--strict" option which will treat unregistered markers as errors allowing to avoid typos and maintain a well described set of markers for your test suite. See examples at <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/mark.html> and its links.
  - issue50: introduce "-m marker" option to select tests based on markers (this is a stricter and more predictable version of '-k' in that "-m" only matches complete markers and has more obvious rules for and/or semantics.
  - new feature to help optimizing the speed of your tests: --durations=N option for displaying N slowest test calls and setup/teardown methods.
  - fix issue87: --pastebin now works with python3
  - fix issue89: --pdb with unexpected exceptions in doctest work more sensibly
  - fix and cleanup pytest's own test suite to not leak FDs

  - refine test discovery by package/module name (--pyargs), thanks Florian Mayer
  - fix issue69 / assertion rewriting fixed on some boolean operations
  - fix issue68 / packages now work with assertion rewriting
  - fix issue66: use different assertion rewriting caches when the -O option is passed
  - don't try assertion rewriting on Jython, use reinterp

### 2.1.1

  - fix issue60 / fix error conditions involving the creation of \_\_pycache\_\_
  - fix issue63 / assertion rewriting on inserts involving strings containing '%'

  - fix issue61: assertion rewriting on boolean operations with 3 or more operands
  - you can now build a man page with "cd doc ; make man"

### 2.1.0 (2011-07-09)

  - fix issue53 call nosestyle setup functions with correct ordering
  - fix issue58 and issue59: new assertion code fixes
  - merge Benjamin's assertionrewrite branch: now assertions for test modules on python 2.6 and above are done by rewriting the AST and saving the pyc file before the test module is imported. see doc/assert.txt for more info.
  - fix issue43: improve doctests with better traceback reporting on unexpected exceptions
  - fix issue47: timing output in junitxml for test cases is now correct
  - fix issue48: typo in MarkInfo repr leading to exception

### 2.0.3 (2011-05-11)

  - fix issue38: nicer tracebacks on calls to hooks, particularly early configure/sessionstart ones
  - fix missing skip reason/meta information in junitxml files, reported via <http://lists.idyll.org/pipermail/testing-in-python/2011-March/003928.html>
  - fix issue34: avoid collection failure with "test" prefixed classes deriving from object.
  - don't require zlib (and other libs) for genscript plugin without --genscript actually being used.
  - speed up skips (by not doing a full traceback representation internally)
  - fix issue37: avoid invalid characters in junitxml's output

### 2.0.2 (2011-03-09)

  - tackle issue32 - speed up test runs of very quick test functions by reducing the relative overhead

  - fix issue30 - extended xfail/skipif handling and improved reporting. If you have a syntax error in your skip/xfail expressions you now get nice error reports.
    
    Also you can now access module globals from xfail/skipif expressions so that this for example works now:
    
        import pytest
        import mymodule
        @pytest.mark.skipif("mymodule.__version__[0] == "1")
        def test_function():
            pass
    
    This will not run the test function if the module's version string does not start with a "1". Note that specifying a string instead of a boolean expressions allows py.test to report meaningful information when summarizing a test run as to what conditions lead to skipping (or xfail-ing) tests.

  - fix issue28 - setup\_method and pytest\_generate\_tests work together The setup\_method fixture method now gets called also for test function invocations generated from the pytest\_generate\_tests hook.

  - fix issue27 - collectonly and keyword-selection (-k) now work together Also, if you do "py.test --collectonly -q" you now get a flat list of test ids that you can use to paste to the py.test commandline in order to execute a particular test.

  - fix issue25 avoid reported problems with --pdb and python3.2/encodings output

  - fix issue23 - tmpdir argument now works on Python3.2 and WindowsXP Starting with Python3.2 os.symlink may be supported. By requiring a newer py lib version the py.path.local() implementation acknowledges this.

  - fixed typos in the docs (thanks Victor Garcia, Brianna Laugher) and particular thanks to Laura Creighton who also reviewed parts of the documentation.

  - fix slightly wrong output of verbose progress reporting for classes (thanks Amaury)

  - more precise (avoiding of) deprecation warnings for node.Class|Function accesses

  - avoid std unittest assertion helper code in tracebacks (thanks Ronny)

### 2.0.1 (2011-02-07)

  - refine and unify initial capturing so that it works nicely even if the logging module is used on an early-loaded conftest.py file or plugin.
  - allow to omit "()" in test ids to allow for uniform test ids as produced by Alfredo's nice pytest.vim plugin.
  - fix issue12 - show plugin versions with "--version" and "--traceconfig" and also document how to add extra information to reporting test header
  - fix issue17 (import-\* reporting issue on python3) by requiring py\>1.4.0 (1.4.1 is going to include it)
  - fix issue10 (numpy arrays truth checking) by refining assertion interpretation in py lib
  - fix issue15: make nose compatibility tests compatible with python3 (now that nose-1.0 supports python3)
  - remove somewhat surprising "same-conftest" detection because it ignores conftest.py when they appear in several subdirs.
  - improve assertions ("not in"), thanks Floris Bruynooghe
  - improve behaviour/warnings when running on top of "python -OO" (assertions and docstrings are turned off, leading to potential false positives)
  - introduce a pytest\_cmdline\_processargs(args) hook to allow dynamic computation of command line arguments. This fixes a regression because py.test prior to 2.0 allowed to set command line options from conftest.py files which so far pytest-2.0 only allowed from ini-files now.
  - fix issue7: assert failures in doctest modules. unexpected failures in doctests will not generally show nicer, i.e. within the doctest failing context.
  - fix issue9: setup/teardown functions for an xfail-marked test will report as xfail if they fail but report as normally passing (not xpassing) if they succeed. This only is true for "direct" setup/teardown invocations because teardown\_class/ teardown\_module cannot closely relate to a single test.
  - fix issue14: no logging errors at process exit
  - refinements to "collecting" output on non-ttys
  - refine internal plugin registration and --traceconfig output
  - introduce a mechanism to prevent/unregister plugins from the command line, see <http://pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/plugins.html#cmdunregister>
  - activate resultlog plugin by default
  - fix regression wrt yielded tests which due to the collection-before-running semantics were not setup as with pytest 1.3.4. Note, however, that the recommended and much cleaner way to do test parameterization remains the "pytest\_generate\_tests" mechanism, see the docs.

### 2.0.0 (2010-11-25)

  - pytest-2.0 is now its own package and depends on pylib-2.0
  - new ability: python -m pytest / python -m pytest.main ability
  - new python invocation: pytest.main(args, plugins) to load some custom plugins early.
  - try harder to run unittest test suites in a more compatible manner by deferring setup/teardown semantics to the unittest package. also work harder to run twisted/trial and Django tests which should now basically work by default.
  - introduce a new way to set config options via ini-style files, by default setup.cfg and tox.ini files are searched. The old ways (certain environment variables, dynamic conftest.py reading is removed).
  - add a new "-q" option which decreases verbosity and prints a more nose/unittest-style "dot" output.
  - fix issue135 - marks now work with unittest test cases as well
  - fix issue126 - introduce py.test.set\_trace() to trace execution via PDB during the running of tests even if capturing is ongoing.
  - fix issue123 - new "python -m py.test" invocation for py.test (requires Python 2.5 or above)
  - fix issue124 - make reporting more resilient against tests opening files on filedescriptor 1 (stdout).
  - fix issue109 - sibling conftest.py files will not be loaded. (and Directory collectors cannot be customized anymore from a Directory's conftest.py - this needs to happen at least one level up).
  - introduce (customizable) assertion failure representations and enhance output on assertion failures for comparisons and other cases (Floris Bruynooghe)
  - nose-plugin: pass through type-signature failures in setup/teardown functions instead of not calling them (Ed Singleton)
  - remove py.test.collect.Directory (follows from a major refactoring and simplification of the collection process)
  - majorly reduce py.test core code, shift function/python testing to own plugin
  - fix issue88 (finding custom test nodes from command line arg)
  - refine 'tmpdir' creation, will now create basenames better associated with test names (thanks Ronny)
  - "xpass" (unexpected pass) tests don't cause exitcode\!=0
  - fix issue131 / issue60 - importing doctests in \_\_init\_\_ files used as namespace packages
  - fix issue93 stdout/stderr is captured while importing conftest.py
  - fix bug: unittest collected functions now also can have "pytestmark" applied at class/module level
  - add ability to use "class" level for cached\_setup helper
  - fix strangeness: mark.\* objects are now immutable, create new instances

### 1.3.4 (2010-09-14)

  - fix issue111: improve install documentation for windows
  - fix issue119: fix custom collectability of \_\_init\_\_.py as a module
  - fix issue116: --doctestmodules work with \_\_init\_\_.py files as well
  - fix issue115: unify internal exception passthrough/catching/GeneratorExit
  - fix issue118: new --tb=native for presenting cpython-standard exceptions

### 1.3.3 (2010-07-30)

  - fix issue113: assertion representation problem with triple-quoted strings (and possibly other cases)
  - make conftest loading detect that a conftest file with the same content was already loaded, avoids surprises in nested directory structures which can be produced e.g. by Hudson. It probably removes the need to use --confcutdir in most cases.
  - fix terminal coloring for win32 (thanks Michael Foord for reporting)
  - fix weirdness: make terminal width detection work on stdout instead of stdin (thanks Armin Ronacher for reporting)
  - remove trailing whitespace in all py/text distribution files

### 1.3.2 (2010-07-08)

**New features**

  - fix issue103: introduce py.test.raises as context manager, examples:
    
        with py.test.raises(ZeroDivisionError):
            x = 0
            1 / x
        
        with py.test.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:
            call_something()
        
        # you may do extra checks on excinfo.value|type|traceback here
    
    (thanks Ronny Pfannschmidt)

  - Funcarg factories can now dynamically apply a marker to a test invocation. This is for example useful if a factory provides parameters to a test which are expected-to-fail:
    
        def pytest_funcarg__arg(request):
            request.applymarker(py.test.mark.xfail(reason="flaky config"))
            ...
        
        def test_function(arg):
            ...

  - improved error reporting on collection and import errors. This makes use of a more general mechanism, namely that for custom test item/collect nodes `node.repr_failure(excinfo)` is now uniformly called so that you can override it to return a string error representation of your choice which is going to be reported as a (red) string.

  - introduce '--junitprefix=STR' option to prepend a prefix to all reports in the junitxml file.

**Bug fixes**

  - make tests and the `pytest_recwarn` plugin in particular fully compatible to Python2.7 (if you use the `recwarn` funcarg warnings will be enabled so that you can properly check for their existence in a cross-python manner).
  - refine --pdb: ignore xfailed tests, unify its TB-reporting and don't display failures again at the end.
  - fix assertion interpretation with the \*\* operator (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
  - fix issue105 assignment on the same line as a failing assertion (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
  - fix issue104 proper escaping for test names in junitxml plugin (thanks anonymous)
  - fix issue57 -f|--looponfail to work with xpassing tests (thanks Ronny)
  - fix issue92 collectonly reporter and --pastebin (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
  - fix py.code.compile(source) to generate unique filenames
  - fix assertion re-interp problems on PyPy, by deferring code compilation to the (overridable) Frame.eval class. (thanks Amaury Forgeot)
  - fix py.path.local.pyimport() to work with directories
  - streamline py.path.local.mkdtemp implementation and usage
  - don't print empty lines when showing junitxml-filename
  - add optional boolean ignore\_errors parameter to py.path.local.remove
  - fix terminal writing on win32/python2.4
  - py.process.cmdexec() now tries harder to return properly encoded unicode objects on all python versions
  - install plain py.test/py.which scripts also for Jython, this helps to get canonical script paths in virtualenv situations
  - make path.bestrelpath(path) return ".", note that when calling X.bestrelpath the assumption is that X is a directory.
  - make initial conftest discovery ignore "--" prefixed arguments
  - fix resultlog plugin when used in a multicpu/multihost xdist situation (thanks Jakub Gustak)
  - perform distributed testing related reporting in the xdist-plugin rather than having dist-related code in the generic py.test distribution
  - fix homedir detection on Windows
  - ship distribute\_setup.py version 0.6.13

### 1.3.1 (2010-05-25)

**New features**

  - issue91: introduce new py.test.xfail(reason) helper to imperatively mark a test as expected to fail. Can be used from within setup and test functions. This is useful especially for parametrized tests when certain configurations are expected-to-fail. In this case the declarative approach with the @py.test.mark.xfail cannot be used as it would mark all configurations as xfail.

  - issue102: introduce new --maxfail=NUM option to stop test runs after NUM failures. This is a generalization of the '-x' or '--exitfirst' option which is now equivalent to '--maxfail=1'. Both '-x' and '--maxfail' will now also print a line near the end indicating the Interruption.

  - issue89: allow py.test.mark decorators to be used on classes (class decorators were introduced with python2.6) and also allow to have multiple markers applied at class/module level by specifying a list.

  - improve and refine letter reporting in the progress bar: . pass f failed test s skipped tests (reminder: use for dependency/platform mismatch only) x xfailed test (test that was expected to fail) X xpassed test (test that was expected to fail but passed)
    
    You can use any combination of 'fsxX' with the '-r' extended reporting option. The xfail/xpass results will show up as skipped tests in the junitxml output - which also fixes issue99.

  - make py.test.cmdline.main() return the exitstatus instead of raising SystemExit and also allow it to be called multiple times. This of course requires that your application and tests are properly teared down and don't have global state.

**Bug Fixes**

  - improved traceback presentation:
      - improved and unified reporting for "--tb=short" option
      - Errors during test module imports are much shorter, (using --tb=short style)
      - raises shows shorter more relevant tracebacks
      - \--fulltrace now more systematically makes traces longer / inhibits cutting
  - improve support for raises and other dynamically compiled code by manipulating python's linecache.cache instead of the previous rather hacky way of creating custom code objects. This makes it seamlessly work on Jython and PyPy where it previously didn't.
  - fix issue96: make capturing more resilient against Control-C interruptions (involved somewhat substantial refactoring to the underlying capturing functionality to avoid race conditions).
  - fix chaining of conditional skipif/xfail decorators - so it works now as expected to use multiple @py.test.mark.skipif(condition) decorators, including specific reporting which of the conditions lead to skipping.
  - fix issue95: late-import zlib so that it's not required for general py.test startup.
  - fix issue94: make reporting more robust against bogus source code (and internally be more careful when presenting unexpected byte sequences)

### 1.3.0 (2010-05-05)

  - deprecate --report option in favour of a new shorter and easier to remember -r option: it takes a string argument consisting of any combination of 'xfsX' characters. They relate to the single chars you see during the dotted progress printing and will print an extra line per test at the end of the test run. This extra line indicates the exact position or test ID that you directly paste to the py.test cmdline in order to re-run a particular test.

  - allow external plugins to register new hooks via the new pytest\_addhooks(pluginmanager) hook. The new release of the pytest-xdist plugin for distributed and looponfailing testing requires this feature.

  - add a new pytest\_ignore\_collect(path, config) hook to allow projects and plugins to define exclusion behaviour for their directory structure -for example you may define in a conftest.py this method:
    
        def pytest_ignore_collect(path):
            return path.check(link=1)
    
    to prevent even a collection try of any tests in symlinked dirs.

  - new pytest\_pycollect\_makemodule(path, parent) hook for allowing customization of the Module collection object for a matching test module.

  - extend and refine xfail mechanism: `@py.test.mark.xfail(run=False)` do not run the decorated test `@py.test.mark.xfail(reason="...")` prints the reason string in xfail summaries specifying `--runxfail` on command line virtually ignores xfail markers

  - expose (previously internal) commonly useful methods: py.io.get\_terminal\_with() -\> return terminal width py.io.ansi\_print(...) -\> print colored/bold text on linux/win32 py.io.saferepr(obj) -\> return limited representation string

  - expose test outcome related exceptions as py.test.skip.Exception, py.test.raises.Exception etc., useful mostly for plugins doing special outcome interpretation/tweaking

  - (issue85) fix junitxml plugin to handle tests with non-ascii output

  - fix/refine python3 compatibility (thanks Benjamin Peterson)

  - fixes for making the jython/win32 combination work, note however: jython2.5.1/win32 does not provide a command line launcher, see <https://bugs.jython.org/issue1491> . See pylib install documentation for how to work around.

  - fixes for handling of unicode exception values and unprintable objects

  - (issue87) fix unboundlocal error in assertionold code

  - (issue86) improve documentation for looponfailing

  - refine IO capturing: stdin-redirect pseudo-file now has a NOP close() method

  - ship distribute\_setup.py version 0.6.10

  - added links to the new capturelog and coverage plugins

### 1.2.0 (2010-01-18)

  - refined usage and options for "py.cleanup":
    
        py.cleanup     # remove "*.pyc" and "*$py.class" (jython) files
        py.cleanup -e .swp -e .cache # also remove files with these extensions
        py.cleanup -s  # remove "build" and "dist" directory next to setup.py files
        py.cleanup -d  # also remove empty directories
        py.cleanup -a  # synonym for "-s -d -e 'pip-log.txt'"
        py.cleanup -n  # dry run, only show what would be removed

  - add a new option "py.test --funcargs" which shows available funcargs and their help strings (docstrings on their respective factory function) for a given test path

  - display a short and concise traceback if a funcarg lookup fails

  - early-load "conftest.py" files in non-dot first-level sub directories. allows to conveniently keep and access test-related options in a `test` subdir and still add command line options.

  - fix issue67: new super-short traceback-printing option: "--tb=line" will print a single line for each failing (python) test indicating its filename, lineno and the failure value

  - fix issue78: always call python-level teardown functions even if the according setup failed. This includes refinements for calling setup\_module/class functions which will now only be called once instead of the previous behaviour where they'd be called multiple times if they raise an exception (including a Skipped exception). Any exception will be re-corded and associated with all tests in the according module/class scope.

  - fix issue63: assume \<40 columns to be a bogus terminal width, default to 80

  - fix pdb debugging to be in the correct frame on raises-related errors

  - update apipkg.py to fix an issue where recursive imports might unnecessarily break importing

  - fix plugin links

### 1.1.1 (2009-11-24)

  - moved dist/looponfailing from py.test core into a new separately released pytest-xdist plugin.
  - new junitxml plugin: --junitxml=path will generate a junit style xml file which is processable e.g. by the Hudson CI system.
  - new option: --genscript=path will generate a standalone py.test script which will not need any libraries installed. thanks to Ralf Schmitt.
  - new option: --ignore will prevent specified path from collection. Can be specified multiple times.
  - new option: --confcutdir=dir will make py.test only consider conftest files that are relative to the specified dir.
  - new funcarg: "pytestconfig" is the pytest config object for access to command line args and can now be easily used in a test.
  - install `py.test` and `py.which` with a `-$VERSION` suffix to disambiguate between Python3, python2.X, Jython and PyPy installed versions.
  - new "pytestconfig" funcarg allows access to test config object
  - new "pytest\_report\_header" hook can return additional lines to be displayed at the header of a test run.
  - (experimental) allow "py.test path::name1::name2::..." for pointing to a test within a test collection directly. This might eventually evolve as a full substitute to "-k" specifications.
  - streamlined plugin loading: order is now as documented in customize.html: setuptools, ENV, commandline, conftest. also setuptools entry point names are turned to canonical names ("[pytest]()\*")
  - automatically skip tests that need 'capfd' but have no os.dup
  - allow pytest\_generate\_tests to be defined in classes as well
  - deprecate usage of 'disabled' attribute in favour of pytestmark
  - deprecate definition of Directory, Module, Class and Function nodes in conftest.py files. Use pytest collect hooks instead.
  - collection/item node specific runtest/collect hooks are only called exactly on matching conftest.py files, i.e. ones which are exactly below the filesystem path of an item
  - change: the first pytest\_collect\_directory hook to return something will now prevent further hooks to be called.
  - change: figleaf plugin now requires --figleaf to run. Also change its long command line options to be a bit shorter (see py.test -h).
  - change: pytest doctest plugin is now enabled by default and has a new option --doctest-glob to set a pattern for file matches.
  - change: remove internal py.\_\* helper vars, only keep py.\_pydir
  - robustify capturing to survive if custom pytest\_runtest\_setup code failed and prevented the capturing setup code from running.
  - make py.test.\* helpers provided by default plugins visible early -works transparently both for pydoc and for interactive sessions which will regularly see e.g. py.test.mark and py.test.importorskip.
  - simplify internal plugin manager machinery
  - simplify internal collection tree by introducing a RootCollector node
  - fix assert reinterpreation that sees a call containing "keyword=..."
  - fix issue66: invoke pytest\_sessionstart and pytest\_sessionfinish hooks on worker nodes during dist-testing, report module/session teardown hooks correctly.
  - fix issue65: properly handle dist-testing if no execnet/py lib installed remotely.
  - skip some install-tests if no execnet is available
  - fix docs, fix internal bin/ script generation

### 1.1.0 (2009-11-05)

  - introduce automatic plugin registration via 'pytest11' entrypoints via setuptools' pkg\_resources.iter\_entry\_points
  - fix py.test dist-testing to work with execnet \>= 1.0.0b4
  - re-introduce py.test.cmdline.main() for better backward compatibility
  - svn paths: fix a bug with path.check(versioned=True) for svn paths, allow '%' in svn paths, make svnwc.update() default to interactive mode like in 1.0.x and add svnwc.update(interactive=False) to inhibit interaction.
  - refine distributed tarball to contain test and no pyc files
  - try harder to have deprecation warnings for py.compat.\* accesses report a correct location

### 1.0.3

  - adjust and improve docs
  - remove py.rest tool and internal namespace - it was never really advertised and can still be used with the old release if needed. If there is interest it could be revived into its own tool i guess.
  - fix issue48 and issue59: raise an Error if the module from an imported test file does not seem to come from the filepath - avoids "same-name" confusion that has been reported repeatedly
  - merged Ronny's nose-compatibility hacks: now nose-style setup\_module() and setup() functions are supported
  - introduce generalized py.test.mark function marking
  - reshuffle / refine command line grouping
  - deprecate parser.addgroup in favour of getgroup which creates option group
  - add --report command line option that allows to control showing of skipped/xfailed sections
  - generalized skipping: a new way to mark python functions with skipif or xfail at function, class and modules level based on platform or sys-module attributes.
  - extend py.test.mark decorator to allow for positional args
  - introduce and test "py.cleanup -d" to remove empty directories
  - fix issue \#59 - robustify unittest test collection
  - make bpython/help interaction work by adding an \_\_all\_\_ attribute to ApiModule, cleanup initpkg
  - use MIT license for pylib, add some contributors
  - remove py.execnet code and substitute all usages with 'execnet' proper
  - fix issue50 - cached\_setup now caches more to expectations for test functions with multiple arguments.
  - merge Jarko's fixes, issue \#45 and \#46
  - add the ability to specify a path for py.lookup to search in
  - fix a funcarg cached\_setup bug probably only occurring in distributed testing and "module" scope with teardown.
  - many fixes and changes for making the code base python3 compatible, many thanks to Benjamin Peterson for helping with this.
  - consolidate builtins implementation to be compatible with \>=2.3, add helpers to ease keeping 2 and 3k compatible code
  - deprecate py.compat.doctesttextwrap|optparse
  - deprecate py.magic.autopath, remove py/magic directory
  - move pytest assertion handling to py/code and a pytest\_assertion plugin, add "--no-assert" option, deprecate py.magic namespaces in favour of (less) py.code ones.
  - consolidate and cleanup py/code classes and files
  - cleanup py/misc, move tests to bin-for-dist
  - introduce delattr/delitem/delenv methods to py.test's monkeypatch funcarg
  - consolidate py.log implementation, remove old approach.
  - introduce py.io.TextIO and py.io.BytesIO for distinguishing between text/unicode and byte-streams (uses underlying standard lib io.\* if available)
  - make py.unittest\_convert helper script available which converts "unittest.py" style files into the simpler assert/direct-test-classes py.test/nosetests style. The script was written by Laura Creighton.
  - simplified internal localpath implementation

### 1.0.2 (2009-08-27)

  - fixing packaging issues, triggered by fedora redhat packaging, also added doc, examples and contrib dirs to the tarball.
  - added a documentation link to the new django plugin.

### 1.0.1 (2009-08-19)

  - added a 'pytest\_nose' plugin which handles nose.SkipTest, nose-style function/method/generator setup/teardown and tries to report functions correctly.
  - capturing of unicode writes or encoded strings to sys.stdout/err work better, also terminalwriting was adapted and somewhat unified between windows and linux.
  - improved documentation layout and content a lot
  - added a "--help-config" option to show conftest.py / ENV-var names for all longopt cmdline options, and some special conftest.py variables. renamed 'conf\_capture' conftest setting to 'option\_capture' accordingly.
  - fix issue \#27: better reporting on non-collectable items given on commandline (e.g. pyc files)
  - fix issue \#33: added --version flag (thanks Benjamin Peterson)
  - fix issue \#32: adding support for "incomplete" paths to wcpath.status()
  - "Test" prefixed classes are *not* collected by default anymore if they have an \_\_init\_\_ method
  - monkeypatch setenv() now accepts a "prepend" parameter
  - improved reporting of collection error tracebacks
  - simplified multicall mechanism and plugin architecture, renamed some internal methods and argnames

### 1.0.0 (2009-08-04)

  - more terse reporting try to show filesystem path relatively to current dir
  - improve xfail output a bit

### 1.0.0b9 (2009-07-31)

  - cleanly handle and report final teardown of test setup
  - fix svn-1.6 compat issue with py.path.svnwc().versioned() (thanks Wouter Vanden Hove)
  - setup/teardown or collection problems now show as ERRORs or with big "E"'s in the progress lines. they are reported and counted separately.
  - dist-testing: properly handle test items that get locally collected but cannot be collected on the remote side - often due to platform/dependency reasons
  - simplified py.test.mark API - see keyword plugin documentation
  - integrate better with logging: capturing now by default captures test functions and their immediate setup/teardown in a single stream
  - capsys and capfd funcargs now have a readouterr() and a close() method (underlyingly py.io.StdCapture/FD objects are used which grew a readouterr() method as well to return snapshots of captured out/err)
  - make assert-reinterpretation work better with comparisons not returning bools (reported with numpy from thanks maciej fijalkowski)
  - reworked per-test output capturing into the pytest\_iocapture.py plugin and thus removed capturing code from config object
  - item.repr\_failure(excinfo) instead of item.repr\_failure(excinfo, outerr)

### 1.0.0b8 (2009-07-22)

  - pytest\_unittest-plugin is now enabled by default
  - introduced pytest\_keyboardinterrupt hook and refined pytest\_sessionfinish hooked, added tests.
  - workaround a buggy logging module interaction ("closing already closed files"). Thanks to Sridhar Ratnakumar for triggering.
  - if plugins use "py.test.importorskip" for importing a dependency only a warning will be issued instead of exiting the testing process.
  - many improvements to docs:
      - refined funcargs doc , use the term "factory" instead of "provider"
      - added a new talk/tutorial doc page
      - better download page
      - better plugin docstrings
      - added new plugins page and automatic doc generation script
  - fixed teardown problem related to partially failing funcarg setups (thanks MrTopf for reporting), "pytest\_runtest\_teardown" is now always invoked even if the "pytest\_runtest\_setup" failed.
  - tweaked doctest output for docstrings in py modules, thanks Radomir.

### 1.0.0b7

  - renamed py.test.xfail back to py.test.mark.xfail to avoid two ways to decorate for xfail
  - re-added py.test.mark decorator for setting keywords on functions (it was actually documented so removing it was not nice)
  - remove scope-argument from request.addfinalizer() because request.cached\_setup has the scope arg. TOOWTDI.
  - perform setup finalization before reporting failures
  - apply modified patches from Andreas Kloeckner to allow test functions to have no func\_code (\#22) and to make "-k" and function keywords work (\#20)
  - apply patch from Daniel Peolzleithner (issue \#23)
  - resolve issue \#18, multiprocessing.Manager() and redirection clash
  - make \_\_name\_\_ == "\_\_channelexec\_\_" for remote\_exec code

### 1.0.0b3 (2009-06-19)

  - plugin classes are removed: one now defines hooks directly in conftest.py or global [pytest]()\*.py files.
  - added new pytest\_namespace(config) hook that allows to inject helpers directly to the py.test.\* namespace.
  - documented and refined many hooks
  - added new style of generative tests via pytest\_generate\_tests hook that integrates well with function arguments.

### 1.0.0b1

  - introduced new "funcarg" setup method, see doc/test/funcarg.txt
  - introduced plugin architecture and many new py.test plugins, see doc/test/plugins.txt
  - teardown\_method is now guaranteed to get called after a test method has run.
  - new method: py.test.importorskip(mod,minversion) will either import or call py.test.skip()
  - completely revised internal py.test architecture
  - new py.process.ForkedFunc object allowing to fork execution of a function to a sub process and getting a result back.

XXX lots of things missing here XXX

### 0.9.2

  - refined installation and metadata, created new setup.py, now based on setuptools/ez\_setup (thanks to Ralf Schmitt for his support).
  - improved the way of making py.\* scripts available in windows environments, they are now added to the Scripts directory as ".cmd" files.
  - py.path.svnwc.status() now is more complete and uses xml output from the 'svn' command if available (Guido Wesdorp)
  - fix for py.path.svn\* to work with svn 1.5 (Chris Lamb)
  - fix path.relto(otherpath) method on windows to use normcase for checking if a path is relative.
  - py.test's traceback is better parseable from editors (follows the filenames:LINENO: MSG convention) (thanks to Osmo Salomaa)
  - fix to javascript-generation, "py.test --runbrowser" should work more reliably now
  - removed previously accidentally added py.test.broken and py.test.notimplemented helpers.
  - there now is a py.\_\_version\_\_ attribute

# Contributing

Contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated. Every little bit of help counts, so do not hesitate\!

## Feature requests and feedback

Do you like pytest? Share some love on Twitter or in your blog posts\!

We'd also like to hear about your propositions and suggestions. Feel free to [submit them as issues](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues) and:

  - Explain in detail how they should work.
  - Keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will make it easier to implement.

## Report bugs

Report bugs for pytest in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

  - Your operating system name and version.
  - Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting, specifically the Python interpreter version, installed libraries, and pytest version.
  - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you can write a demonstration test that currently fails but should pass (xfail), that is a very useful commit to make as well, even if you cannot fix the bug itself.

## Fix bugs

Look through the [GitHub issues for bugs](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type:%20bug). See also the ["good first issue" issues](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/good%20first%20issue) that are friendly to new contributors.

\[Talk \<contact\>\](\#talk-\<contact\>) to developers to find out how you can fix specific bugs. To indicate that you are going to work on a particular issue, add a comment to that effect on the specific issue.

Don't forget to check the issue trackers of your favourite plugins, too\!

## Implement features

Look through the [GitHub issues for enhancements](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type:%20enhancement).

\[Talk \<contact\>\](\#talk-\<contact\>) to developers to find out how you can implement specific features.

## Write documentation

Pytest could always use more documentation. What exactly is needed?

  - More complementary documentation. Have you perhaps found something unclear?
  - Documentation translations. We currently have only English.
  - Docstrings. There can never be too many of them.
  - Blog posts, articles and such -- they're all very appreciated.

You can also edit documentation files directly in the GitHub web interface, without using a local copy. This can be convenient for small fixes.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Build the documentation locally with the following command:

``` bash
$ tox -e docs
```

The built documentation should be available in `doc/en/_build/html`, where 'en' refers to the documentation language.

</div>

Pytest has an API reference which in large part is [generated automatically](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) from the docstrings of the documented items. Pytest uses the [Sphinx docstring format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html). For example:

`` `python     def my_function(arg: ArgType) -> Foo:         """Do important stuff.          More detailed info here, in separate paragraphs from the subject line.         Use proper sentences -- start sentences with capital letters and end         with periods.          Can include annotated documentation:          :param short_arg: An argument which determines stuff.         :param long_arg:             A long explanation which spans multiple lines, overflows             like this.         :returns: The result.         :raises ValueError:             Detailed information when this can happen.          .. versionadded:: 6.0          Including types into the annotations above is not necessary when         type-hinting is being used (as in this example).         """   .. _submitplugin:  Submitting Plugins to pytest-dev ``\` --------------------------------

Development of the pytest core, support code, and some plugins happens in repositories living under the `pytest-dev` organisations:

  - [pytest-dev on GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev)

All pytest-dev Contributors team members have write access to all contained repositories. Pytest core and plugins are generally developed using [pull requests](#pull%20requests) to respective repositories.

The objectives of the `pytest-dev` organisation are:

  - Having a central location for popular pytest plugins
  - Sharing some of the maintenance responsibility (in case a maintainer no longer wishes to maintain a plugin)

You can submit your plugin by subscribing to the [pytest-dev mail list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pytest-dev) and writing a mail pointing to your existing pytest plugin repository which must have the following:

  - PyPI presence with packaging metadata that contains a `pytest-` prefixed name, version number, authors, short and long description.
  - a [tox configuration](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#configuration-discovery) for running tests using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io).
  - a `README` describing how to use the plugin and on which platforms it runs.
  - a `LICENSE` file containing the licensing information, with matching info in its packaging metadata.
  - an issue tracker for bug reports and enhancement requests.
  - a [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

If no contributor strongly objects and two agree, the repository can then be transferred to the `pytest-dev` organisation.

Here's a rundown of how a repository transfer usually proceeds (using a repository named `joedoe/pytest-xyz` as example):

  - `joedoe` transfers repository ownership to `pytest-dev` administrator `calvin`.
  - `calvin` creates `pytest-xyz-admin` and `pytest-xyz-developers` teams, inviting `joedoe` to both as **maintainer**.
  - `calvin` transfers repository to `pytest-dev` and configures team access:
      - `pytest-xyz-admin` **admin** access;
      - `pytest-xyz-developers` **write** access;

The `pytest-dev/Contributors` team has write access to all projects, and every project administrator is in it. We recommend that each plugin has at least three people who have the right to release to PyPI.

Repository owners can rest assured that no `pytest-dev` administrator will ever make releases of your repository or take ownership in any way, except in rare cases where someone becomes unresponsive after months of contact attempts. As stated, the objective is to share maintenance and avoid "plugin-abandon".

## Preparing Pull Requests<span id="pull requests"></span>

### Short version

1.  Fork the repository.

2.  Fetch tags from upstream if necessary (if you cloned only main <span class="title-ref">git fetch --tags https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest</span>).

3.  Enable and install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to ensure style-guides and code checks are followed.

4.  Follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for naming.

5.  Tests are run using `tox`:
    
        tox -e linting,py39
    
    The test environments above are usually enough to cover most cases locally.

6.  Write a `changelog` entry: `changelog/2574.bugfix.rst`, use issue id number and one of `feature`, `improvement`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `deprecation`, `breaking`, `vendor` or `trivial` for the issue type.

7.  Unless your change is a trivial or a documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file, in alphabetical order.

### Long version

What is a "pull request"? It informs the project's core developers about the changes you want to review and merge. Pull requests are stored on [GitHub servers](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pulls). Once you send a pull request, we can discuss its potential modifications and even add more commits to it later on. There's an excellent tutorial on how Pull Requests work in the [GitHub Help Center](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Here is a simple overview, with pytest-specific bits:

1.  Fork the [pytest GitHub repository](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest). It's fine to use `pytest` as your fork repository name because it will live under your user.

2.  Clone your fork locally using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and create a branch:
    
        $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pytest.git
        $ cd pytest
        $ git fetch --tags https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
        # now, create your own branch off "main":
        
            $ git checkout -b your-bugfix-branch-name main
    
    Given we have "major.minor.micro" version numbers, bug fixes will usually be released in micro releases whereas features will be released in minor releases and incompatible changes in major releases.
    
    You will need the tags to test locally, so be sure you have the tags from the main repository. If you suspect you don't, set the main repository as upstream and fetch the tags:
    
        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
        $ git fetch upstream --tags
    
    If you need some help with Git, follow this quick start guide: <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart>

3.  Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and its hook on the pytest repo:
    
        $ pip install --user pre-commit
        $ pre-commit install
    
    Afterwards `pre-commit` will run whenever you commit.
    
    <https://pre-commit.com/> is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks to ensure code-style and code formatting is consistent.

4.  Install tox
    
    Tox is used to run all the tests and will automatically setup virtualenvs to run the tests in. (will implicitly use <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>):
    
        $ pip install tox

5.  Run all the tests
    
    You need to have Python 3.8 or later available in your system. Now running tests is as simple as issuing this command:
    
        $ tox -e linting,py39
    
    This command will run tests via the "tox" tool against Python 3.9 and also perform "lint" coding-style checks.

6.  You can now edit your local working copy and run the tests again as necessary. Please follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for naming.
    
    You can pass different options to `tox`. For example, to run tests on Python 3.9 and pass options to pytest (e.g. enter pdb on failure) to pytest you can do:
    
        $ tox -e py39 -- --pdb
    
    Or to only run tests in a particular test module on Python 3.9:
    
        $ tox -e py39 -- testing/test_config.py
    
    When committing, `pre-commit` will re-format the files if necessary.

7.  If instead of using `tox` you prefer to run the tests directly, then we suggest to create a virtual environment and use an editable install with the `dev` extra:
    
        $ python3 -m venv .venv
        $ source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux
        $ .venv/Scripts/activate.bat  # Windows
        $ pip install -e ".[dev]"
    
    Afterwards, you can edit the files and run pytest normally:
    
        $ pytest testing/test_config.py

8.  Create a new changelog entry in `changelog`. The file should be named `<issueid>.<type>.rst`, where *issueid* is the number of the issue related to the change and *type* is one of `feature`, `improvement`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `deprecation`, `breaking`, `vendor` or `trivial`. You may skip creating the changelog entry if the change doesn't affect the documented behaviour of pytest.

9.  Add yourself to `AUTHORS` file if not there yet, in alphabetical order.

10. Commit and push once your tests pass and you are happy with your change(s):
    
        $ git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
        $ git push -u

11. Finally, submit a pull request through the GitHub website using this data:
    
        head-fork: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pytest
        compare: your-branch-name
        
        base-fork: pytest-dev/pytest
        base: main

### Writing Tests

Writing tests for plugins or for pytest itself is often done using the [pytester fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytester), as a "black-box" test.

For example, to ensure a simple test passes you can write:

`` `python     def test_true_assertion(pytester):         pytester.makepyfile(             """             def test_foo():                 assert True         """         )         result = pytester.runpytest()         result.assert_outcomes(failed=0, passed=1)   Alternatively, it is possible to make checks based on the actual output of the termal using ``\` *glob-like* expressions:

`` `python     def test_true_assertion(pytester):         pytester.makepyfile(             """             def test_foo():                 assert False         """         )         result = pytester.runpytest()         result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(["*assert False*", "*1 failed*"])  When choosing a file where to write a new test, take a look at the existing files and see if there's ``<span class="title-ref"> one file which looks like a good fit. For example, a regression test about a bug in the </span><span class="title-ref">--lf</span><span class="title-ref"> option should go into </span><span class="title-ref">test\_cacheprovider.py</span><span class="title-ref">, given that this option is implemented in </span><span class="title-ref">cacheprovider.py</span>\`. If in doubt, go ahead and open a PR with your best guess and we can discuss this over the code.

## Joining the Development Team

Anyone who has successfully seen through a pull request which did not require any extra work from the development team to merge will themselves gain commit access if they so wish (if we forget to ask please send a friendly reminder). This does not mean there is any change in your contribution workflow: everyone goes through the same pull-request-and-review process and no-one merges their own pull requests unless already approved. It does however mean you can participate in the development process more fully since you can merge pull requests from other contributors yourself after having reviewed them.

## Merge/squash guidelines

When a PR is approved and ready to be integrated to the `main` branch, one has the option to *merge* the commits unchanged, or *squash* all the commits into a single commit.

Here are some guidelines on how to proceed, based on examples of a single PR commit history:

1.  Miscellaneous commits:
    
      - `Implement X`
      - `Fix test_a`
      - `Add myself to AUTHORS`
      - `fixup! Fix test_a`
      - `Update tests/test_integration.py`
      - `Merge origin/main into PR branch`
      - `Update tests/test_integration.py`
    
    In this case, prefer to use the **Squash** merge strategy: the commit history is a bit messy (not in a derogatory way, often one just commits changes because they know the changes will eventually be squashed together), so squashing everything into a single commit is best. You must clean up the commit message, making sure it contains useful details.

2.  Separate commits related to the same topic:
    
      - `Implement X`
      - `Add myself to AUTHORS`
      - `Update CHANGELOG for X`
    
    In this case, prefer to use the **Squash** merge strategy: while the commit history is not "messy" as in the example above, the individual commits do not bring much value overall, specially when looking at the changes a few months/years down the line.

3.  Separate commits, each with their own topic (refactorings, renames, etc), but still have a larger topic/purpose.
    
      - `Refactor class X in preparation for feature Y`
      - `Remove unused method`
      - `Implement feature Y`
    
    In this case, prefer to use the **Merge** strategy: each commit is valuable on its own, even if they serve a common topic overall. Looking at the history later, it is useful to have the removal of the unused method separately on its own commit, along with more information (such as how it became unused in the first place).

4.  Separate commits, each with their own topic, but without a larger topic/purpose other than improve the code base (using more modern techniques, improve typing, removing clutter, etc).
    
      - `Improve internal names in X`
      - `Add type annotations to Y`
      - `Remove unnecessary dict access`
      - `Remove unreachable code due to EOL Python`
    
    In this case, prefer to use the **Merge** strategy: each commit is valuable on its own, and the information on each is valuable in the long term.

As mentioned, those are overall guidelines, not rules cast in stone. This topic was discussed in [\#12633](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/discussions/12633).

*Backport PRs* (as those created automatically from a `backport` label) should always be **squashed**, as they preserve the original PR author.

## Backporting bug fixes for the next patch release

Pytest makes a feature release every few weeks or months. In between, patch releases are made to the previous feature release, containing bug fixes only. The bug fixes usually fix regressions, but may be any change that should reach users before the next feature release.

Suppose for example that the latest release was 1.2.3, and you want to include a bug fix in 1.2.4 (check <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases> for the actual latest release). The procedure for this is:

1.  First, make sure the bug is fixed in the `main` branch, with a regular pull request, as described above. An exception to this is if the bug fix is not applicable to `main` anymore.

Automatic method:

Add a `backport 1.2.x` label to the PR you want to backport. This will create a backport PR against the `1.2.x` branch.

Manual method:

1.  `git checkout origin/1.2.x -b backport-XXXX` \# use the main PR number here

2.  Locate the merge commit on the PR, in the *merged* message, for example:
    
    > nicoddemus merged commit 0f8b462 into pytest-dev:main

3.  `git cherry-pick -x -m1 REVISION` \# use the revision you found above (`0f8b462`).

4.  Open a PR targeting `1.2.x`:
    
      - Prefix the message with `[1.2.x]`.
      - Delete the PR body, it usually contains a duplicate commit message.

### Who does the backporting

As mentioned above, bugs should first be fixed on `main` (except in rare occasions that a bug only happens in a previous release). So, who should do the backport procedure described above?

1.  If the bug was fixed by a core developer, it is the main responsibility of that core developer to do the backport.
2.  However, often the merge is done by another maintainer, in which case it is nice of them to do the backport procedure if they have the time.
3.  For bugs submitted by non-maintainers, it is expected that a core developer will to do the backport, normally the one that merged the PR on `main`.
4.  If a non-maintainers notices a bug which is fixed on `main` but has not been backported (due to maintainers forgetting to apply the *needs backport* label, or just plain missing it), they are also welcome to open a PR with the backport. The procedure is simple and really helps with the maintenance of the project.

All the above are not rules, but merely some guidelines/suggestions on what we should expect about backports.

Backports should be **squashed** (rather than **merged**), as doing so preserves the original PR author correctly.

## Handling stale issues/PRs

Stale issues/PRs are those where pytest contributors have asked for questions/changes and the authors didn't get around to answer/implement them yet after a somewhat long time, or the discussion simply died because people seemed to lose interest.

There are many reasons why people don't answer questions or implement requested changes: they might get busy, lose interest, or just forget about it, but the fact is that this is very common in open source software.

The pytest team really appreciates every issue and pull request, but being a high-volume project with many issues and pull requests being submitted daily, we try to reduce the number of stale issues and PRs by regularly closing them. When an issue/pull request is closed in this manner, it is by no means a dismissal of the topic being tackled by the issue/pull request, but it is just a way for us to clear up the queue and make the maintainers' work more manageable. Submitters can always reopen the issue/pull request in their own time later if it makes sense.

### When to close

Here are a few general rules the maintainers use deciding when to close issues/PRs because of lack of inactivity:

  - Issues labeled `question` or `needs information`: closed after 14 days inactive.
  - Issues labeled `proposal`: closed after six months inactive.
  - Pull requests: after one month, consider pinging the author, update linked issue, or consider closing. For pull requests which are nearly finished, the team should consider finishing it up and merging it.

The above are **not hard rules**, but merely **guidelines**, and can be (and often are\!) reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

### Closing pull requests

When closing a Pull Request, it needs to be acknowledging the time, effort, and interest demonstrated by the person which submitted it. As mentioned previously, it is not the intent of the team to dismiss a stalled pull request entirely but to merely to clear up our queue, so a message like the one below is warranted when closing a pull request that went stale:

> Hi \<contributor\>,
> 
> First of all, we would like to thank you for your time and effort on working on this, the pytest team deeply appreciates it.
> 
> We noticed it has been awhile since you have updated this PR, however. pytest is a high activity project, with many issues/PRs being opened daily, so it is hard for us maintainers to track which PRs are ready for merging, for review, or need more attention.
> 
> So for those reasons we, think it is best to close the PR for now, but with the only intention to clean up our queue, it is by no means a rejection of your changes. We still encourage you to re-open this PR (it is just a click of a button away) when you are ready to get back to it.
> 
> Again we appreciate your time for working on this, and hope you might get back to this at a later time\!
> 
> \<bye\>

## Closing issues

When a pull request is submitted to fix an issue, add text like `closes #XYZW` to the PR description and/or commits (where `XYZW` is the issue number). See the [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.

When an issue is due to user error (e.g. misunderstanding of a functionality), please politely explain to the user why the issue raised is really a non-issue and ask them to close the issue if they have no further questions. If the original requester is unresponsive, the issue will be handled as described in the section [Handling stale issues/PRs](#handling-stale-issuesprs) above.

# Deprecations and Removals

This page lists all pytest features that are currently deprecated or have been removed in past major releases. The objective is to give users a clear rationale why a certain feature has been removed, and what alternatives should be used instead.

## Deprecated Features

Below is a complete list of all pytest features which are considered deprecated. Using those features will issue <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.PytestWarning</span> or subclasses, which can be filtered using \[standard warning filters \<warnings\>\](\#standard-warning-filters-\<warnings\>).

### sync test depending on async fixture

<div class="deprecated">

8.4

</div>

Pytest has for a long time given an error when encountering an asynchronous test function, prompting the user to install a plugin that can handle it. It has not given any errors if you have an asynchronous fixture that's depended on by a synchronous test. If the fixture was an async function you did get an "unawaited coroutine" warning, but for async yield fixtures you didn't even get that. This is a problem even if you do have a plugin installed for handling async tests, as they may require special decorators for async fixtures to be handled, and some may not robustly handle if a user accidentally requests an async fixture from their sync tests. Fixture values being cached can make this even more unintuitive, where everything will "work" if the fixture is first requested by an async test, and then requested by a synchronous test.

Unfortunately there is no 100% reliable method of identifying when a user has made a mistake, versus when they expect an unawaited object from their fixture that they will handle on their own. To suppress this warning when you in fact did intend to handle this you can wrap your async fixture in a synchronous fixture:

`` `python     import asyncio     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     async def unawaited_fixture():         return 1       def test_foo(unawaited_fixture):         assert 1 == asyncio.run(unawaited_fixture)  should be changed to   .. code-block:: python      import asyncio     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def unawaited_fixture():         async def inner_fixture():             return 1          return inner_fixture()       def test_foo(unawaited_fixture):         assert 1 == asyncio.run(unawaited_fixture)   You can also make use of `pytest_fixture_setup` to handle the coroutine/asyncgen before pytest sees it - this is the way current async pytest plugins handle it.  If a user has an async fixture with ``autouse=True`in their`conftest.py`, or in a file`\` containing both synchronous tests and the fixture, they will receive this warning. Unless you're using a plugin that specifically handles async fixtures with synchronous tests, we strongly recommend against this practice. It can lead to unpredictable behavior (with larger scopes, it may appear to "work" if an async test is the first to request the fixture, due to value caching) and will generate unawaited-coroutine runtime warnings (but only for non-yield fixtures). Additionally, it creates ambiguity for other developers about whether the fixture is intended to perform setup for synchronous tests.

The [anyio pytest plugin](https://anyio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/testing.html) supports synchronous tests with async fixtures, though certain limitations apply.

### `pytest.importorskip` default behavior regarding <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span>

<div class="deprecated">

8.2

</div>

Traditionally <span class="title-ref">pytest.importorskip</span> will capture <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span>, with the original intent being to skip tests where a dependent module is not installed, for example testing with different dependencies.

However some packages might be installed in the system, but are not importable due to some other issue, for example, a compilation error or a broken installation. In those cases <span class="title-ref">pytest.importorskip</span> would still silently skip the test, but more often than not users would like to see the unexpected error so the underlying issue can be fixed.

In `8.2` the `exc_type` parameter has been added, giving users the ability of passing <span class="title-ref">ModuleNotFoundError</span> to skip tests only if the module cannot really be found, and not because of some other error.

Catching only <span class="title-ref">ModuleNotFoundError</span> by default (and letting other errors propagate) would be the best solution, however for backward compatibility, pytest will keep the existing behavior but raise an warning if:

1.  The captured exception is of type <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span>, and:
2.  The user does not pass `exc_type` explicitly.

If the import attempt raises <span class="title-ref">ModuleNotFoundError</span> (the usual case), then the module is skipped and no warning is emitted.

This way, the usual cases will keep working the same way, while unexpected errors will now issue a warning, with users being able to suppress the warning by passing `exc_type=ImportError` explicitly.

In `9.0`, the warning will turn into an error, and in `9.1` <span class="title-ref">pytest.importorskip</span> will only capture <span class="title-ref">ModuleNotFoundError</span> by default and no warnings will be issued anymore -- but users can still capture <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span> by passing it to `exc_type`.

### `fspath` argument for Node constructors replaced with `pathlib.Path`

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

In order to support the transition from `py.path.local` to `pathlib`, the `fspath` argument to <span class="title-ref">\~\_pytest.nodes.Node</span> constructors like <span class="title-ref">pytest.Function.from\_parent()</span> and <span class="title-ref">pytest.Class.from\_parent()</span> is now deprecated.

Plugins which construct nodes should pass the `path` argument, of type <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path</span>, instead of the `fspath` argument.

Plugins which implement custom items and collectors are encouraged to replace `fspath` parameters (`py.path.local`) with `path` parameters (`pathlib.Path`), and drop any other usage of the `py` library if possible.

If possible, plugins with custom items should use \[cooperative constructors \<uncooperative-constructors-deprecated\>\](\#cooperative constructors-\<uncooperative-constructors-deprecated\>) to avoid hardcoding arguments they only pass on to the superclass.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The name of the <span class="title-ref">\~\_pytest.nodes.Node</span> arguments and attributes (the new attribute being `path`) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks, \[outlined below \<legacy-path-hooks-deprecated\>\](\#outlined-below-\<legacy-path-hooks-deprecated\>) (the old argument being `path`).

This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the `py` dependency (see `9283` for a longer discussion).

</div>

Due to the ongoing migration of methods like <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Item.reportinfo</span> which still is expected to return a `py.path.local` object, nodes still have both `fspath` (`py.path.local`) and `path` (`pathlib.Path`) attributes, no matter what argument was used in the constructor. We expect to deprecate the `fspath` attribute in a future release.

### Configuring hook specs/impls using markers

Before pluggy, pytest's plugin library, was its own package and had a clear API, pytest just used `pytest.mark` to configure hooks.

The :py\`pytest.hookimpl\` and :py\`pytest.hookspec\` decorators have been available since years and should be used instead.

`` `python     @pytest.mark.tryfirst     def pytest_runtest_call(): ...       # or     def pytest_runtest_call(): ...       pytest_runtest_call.tryfirst = True  should be changed to:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)     def pytest_runtest_call(): ...  Changed ``hookimpl`attributes:  *`tryfirst`  `<span class="title-ref"> \* </span><span class="title-ref">trylast</span><span class="title-ref"> \* </span><span class="title-ref">optionalhook</span><span class="title-ref"> \* </span><span class="title-ref">hookwrapper</span>\`

Changed `hookwrapper` attributes:

  - `firstresult`
  - `historic`

### `py.path.local` arguments for hooks replaced with `pathlib.Path`

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

In order to support the transition from `py.path.local` to `pathlib`, the following hooks now receive additional arguments:

  - `pytest_ignore_collect(collection_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_ignore_collect>` as equivalent to `path`
  - `pytest_collect_file(file_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_collect_file>` as equivalent to `path`
  - `pytest_pycollect_makemodule(module_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_pycollect_makemodule>` as equivalent to `path`
  - `pytest_report_header(start_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_report_header>` as equivalent to `startdir`
  - `pytest_report_collectionfinish(start_path: pathlib.Path) <pytest_report_collectionfinish>` as equivalent to `startdir`

The accompanying `py.path.local` based paths have been deprecated: plugins which manually invoke those hooks should only pass the new `pathlib.Path` arguments, and users should change their hook implementations to use the new `pathlib.Path` arguments.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The name of the <span class="title-ref">\~\_pytest.nodes.Node</span> arguments and attributes, \[outlined above \<node-ctor-fspath-deprecation\>\](\#outlined-above-\<node-ctor-fspath-deprecation\>) (the new attribute being `path`) is **the opposite** of the situation for hooks (the old argument being `path`).

This is an unfortunate artifact due to historical reasons, which should be resolved in future versions as we slowly get rid of the `py` dependency (see `9283` for a longer discussion).

</div>

### Directly constructing internal classes

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

Directly constructing the following classes is now deprecated:

  - `_pytest.mark.structures.Mark`
  - `_pytest.mark.structures.MarkDecorator`
  - `_pytest.mark.structures.MarkGenerator`
  - `_pytest.python.Metafunc`
  - `_pytest.runner.CallInfo`
  - `_pytest._code.ExceptionInfo`
  - `_pytest.config.argparsing.Parser`
  - `_pytest.config.argparsing.OptionGroup`
  - `_pytest.pytester.HookRecorder`

These constructors have always been considered private, but now issue a deprecation warning, which may become a hard error in pytest 8.

### Diamond inheritance between <span class="title-ref">pytest.Collector</span> and <span class="title-ref">pytest.Item</span>

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

Defining a custom pytest node type which is both an <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Item</span> and a <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Collector</span> (e.g. <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.File</span>) now issues a warning. It was never sanely supported and triggers hard to debug errors.

Some plugins providing linting/code analysis have been using this as a hack. Instead, a separate collector node should be used, which collects the item. See \[non-python tests\](\#non-python-tests) for an example, as well as an [example pr fixing inheritance](https://github.com/asmeurer/pytest-flakes/pull/40/files).

### Constructors of custom <span class="title-ref">\~\_pytest.nodes.Node</span> subclasses should take `**kwargs`

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

If custom subclasses of nodes like <span class="title-ref">pytest.Item</span> override the `__init__` method, they should take `**kwargs`. Thus,

`` `python     class CustomItem(pytest.Item):         def __init__(self, name, parent, additional_arg):             super().__init__(name, parent)             self.additional_arg = additional_arg  should be turned into:  .. code-block:: python      class CustomItem(pytest.Item):         def __init__(self, *, additional_arg, **kwargs):             super().__init__(**kwargs)             self.additional_arg = additional_arg  to avoid hard-coding the arguments pytest can pass to the superclass. ``\` See \[non-python tests\](\#non-python-tests) for a full example.

For cases without conflicts, no deprecation warning is emitted. For cases with conflicts (such as <span class="title-ref">pytest.File</span> now taking `path` instead of `fspath`, as \[outlined above \<node-ctor-fspath-deprecation\>\](\#outlined-above-\<node-ctor-fspath-deprecation\>)), a deprecation warning is now raised.

### Applying a mark to a fixture function

<div class="deprecated">

7.4

</div>

Applying a mark to a fixture function never had any effect, but it is a common user error.

`` `python     @pytest.mark.usefixtures("clean_database")     @pytest.fixture     def user() -> User: ...  Users expected in this case that the ``usefixtures`mark would have its intended effect of using the`clean\_database`fixture when`user`was invoked, when in fact it has no effect at all.  Now pytest will issue a warning when it encounters this problem, and will raise an error in the future versions.   Returning non-None value in test functions`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="deprecated">

7.2

</div>

A `pytest.PytestReturnNotNoneWarning` is now emitted if a test function returns something other than <span class="title-ref">None</span>.

This prevents a common mistake among beginners that expect that returning a <span class="title-ref">bool</span> would cause a test to pass or fail, for example:

`` `python     @pytest.mark.parametrize(         ["a", "b", "result"],         [             [1, 2, 5],             [2, 3, 8],             [5, 3, 18],         ],     )     def test_foo(a, b, result):         return foo(a, b) == result  Given that pytest ignores the return value, this might be surprising that it will never fail.  The proper fix is to change the `return` to an `assert`:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.mark.parametrize(         ["a", "b", "result"],         [             [1, 2, 5],             [2, 3, 8],             [5, 3, 18],         ],     )     def test_foo(a, b, result):         assert foo(a, b) == result   The ``yield\_fixture`function/decorator`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="deprecated">

6.2

</div>

`pytest.yield_fixture` is a deprecated alias for <span class="title-ref">pytest.fixture</span>.

It has been so for a very long time, so can be search/replaced safely.

## Removed Features and Breaking Changes

As stated in our \[backwards-compatibility\](\#backwards-compatibility) policy, deprecated features are removed only in major releases after an appropriate period of deprecation has passed.

Some breaking changes which could not be deprecated are also listed.

### Support for tests written for nose

<div class="deprecated">

7.2

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

Support for running tests written for [nose](https://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is now deprecated.

`nose` has been in maintenance mode-only for years, and maintaining the plugin is not trivial as it spills over the code base (see `9886` for more details).

#### setup/teardown

One thing that might catch users by surprise is that plain `setup` and `teardown` methods are not pytest native, they are in fact part of the `nose` support.

`` `python     class Test:         def setup(self):             self.resource = make_resource()          def teardown(self):             self.resource.close()          def test_foo(self): ...          def test_bar(self): ...    Native pytest support uses ``setup\_method`and`teardown\_method`(see [xunit-method-setup](#xunit-method-setup)), so the above should be changed to:  .. code-block:: python      class Test:         def setup_method(self):             self.resource = make_resource()          def teardown_method(self):             self.resource.close()          def test_foo(self): ...          def test_bar(self): ...   This is easy to do in an entire code base by doing a simple find/replace.  @with_setup`\` ^^^^^^^^^^^

Code using [@with\_setup](with-setup-nose) such as this:

`` `python     from nose.tools import with_setup       def setup_some_resource(): ...       def teardown_some_resource(): ...       @with_setup(setup_some_resource, teardown_some_resource)     def test_foo(): ...  Will also need to be ported to a supported pytest style. One way to do it is using a fixture:  .. code-block:: python      import pytest       def setup_some_resource(): ...       def teardown_some_resource(): ...       @pytest.fixture     def some_resource():         setup_some_resource()         yield         teardown_some_resource()       def test_foo(some_resource): ...      The ``compat\_co\_firstlineno`attribute`\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Nose inspects this attribute on function objects to allow overriding the function's inferred line number. Pytest no longer respects this attribute.

### Passing `msg=` to `pytest.skip`, `pytest.fail` or `pytest.exit`

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

Passing the keyword argument `msg` to <span class="title-ref">pytest.skip</span>, <span class="title-ref">pytest.fail</span> or <span class="title-ref">pytest.exit</span> is now deprecated and `reason` should be used instead. This change is to bring consistency between these functions and the `@pytest.mark.skip` and `@pytest.mark.xfail` markers which already accept a `reason` argument.

`` `python     def test_fail_example():         # old         pytest.fail(msg="foo")         # new         pytest.fail(reason="bar")       def test_skip_example():         # old         pytest.skip(msg="foo")         # new         pytest.skip(reason="bar")       def test_exit_example():         # old         pytest.exit(msg="foo")         # new         pytest.exit(reason="bar")   .. _instance-collector-deprecation:  The ``pytest.Instance`collector`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

7.0

</div>

The `pytest.Instance` collector type has been removed.

Previously, Python test methods were collected as <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Class</span> -\> `Instance` -\> <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Function</span>. Now <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Class</span> collects the test methods directly.

Most plugins which reference `Instance` do so in order to ignore or skip it, using a check such as `if isinstance(node, Instance): return`. Such plugins should simply remove consideration of `Instance` on pytest\>=7. However, to keep such uses working, a dummy type has been instanced in `pytest.Instance` and `_pytest.python.Instance`, and importing it emits a deprecation warning. This was removed in pytest 8.

### Using `pytest.warns(None)`

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

<span class="title-ref">pytest.warns(None) \<pytest.warns\></span> is now deprecated because it was frequently misused. Its correct usage was checking that the code emits at least one warning of any type - like `pytest.warns()` or `pytest.warns(Warning)`.

See \[warns use cases\](\#warns-use-cases) for examples.

### Backward compatibilities in `Parser.addoption`

<div class="deprecated">

2.4

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

Several behaviors of <span class="title-ref">Parser.addoption \<pytest.Parser.addoption\></span> are now removed in pytest 8 (deprecated since pytest 2.4.0):

  - `parser.addoption(..., help=".. %default ..")` - use `%(default)s` instead.
  - `parser.addoption(..., type="int/string/float/complex")` - use `type=int` etc. instead.

### The `--strict` command-line option

<div class="deprecated">

6.2

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

The `--strict` command-line option has been deprecated in favor of `--strict-markers`, which better conveys what the option does.

We have plans to maybe in the future to reintroduce `--strict` and make it an encompassing flag for all strictness related options (`--strict-markers` and `--strict-config` at the moment, more might be introduced in the future).

### Implementing the `pytest_cmdline_preparse` hook

<div class="deprecated">

7.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

Implementing the `pytest_cmdline_preparse` hook has been officially deprecated. Implement the `pytest_load_initial_conftests` hook instead.

`` `python     def pytest_cmdline_preparse(config: Config, args: List[str]) -> None: ...       # becomes:       def pytest_load_initial_conftests(         early_config: Config, parser: Parser, args: List[str]     ) -> None: ...   Collection changes in pytest 8 ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Added a new <span class="title-ref">pytest.Directory</span> base collection node, which all collector nodes for filesystem directories are expected to subclass. This is analogous to the existing <span class="title-ref">pytest.File</span> for file nodes.

Changed <span class="title-ref">pytest.Package</span> to be a subclass of <span class="title-ref">pytest.Directory</span>. A `Package` represents a filesystem directory which is a Python package, i.e. contains an `__init__.py` file.

<span class="title-ref">pytest.Package</span> now only collects files in its own directory; previously it collected recursively. Sub-directories are collected as sub-collector nodes, thus creating a collection tree which mirrors the filesystem hierarchy.

<span class="title-ref">session.name \<pytest.Session.name\></span> is now `""`; previously it was the rootdir directory name. This matches <span class="title-ref">session.nodeid \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.nodeid\></span> which has always been <span class="title-ref">""</span>.

Added a new <span class="title-ref">pytest.Dir</span> concrete collection node, a subclass of <span class="title-ref">pytest.Directory</span>. This node represents a filesystem directory, which is not a <span class="title-ref">pytest.Package</span>, i.e. does not contain an `__init__.py` file. Similarly to `Package`, it only collects the files in its own directory, while collecting sub-directories as sub-collector nodes.

Files and directories are now collected in alphabetical order jointly, unless changed by a plugin. Previously, files were collected before directories.

The collection tree now contains directories/packages up to the \[rootdir \<rootdir\>\](\#rootdir-\<rootdir\>), for initial arguments that are found within the rootdir. For files outside the rootdir, only the immediate directory/package is collected --note however that collecting from outside the rootdir is discouraged.

As an example, given the following filesystem tree:

    myroot/
        pytest.ini
        top/
        ├── aaa
        │   └── test_aaa.py
        ├── test_a.py
        ├── test_b
        │   ├── __init__.py
        │   └── test_b.py
        ├── test_c.py
        └── zzz
            ├── __init__.py
            └── test_zzz.py

the collection tree, as shown by <span class="title-ref">pytest --collect-only top/</span> but with the otherwise-hidden <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Session</span> node added for clarity, is now the following:

    <Session>
      <Dir myroot>
        <Dir top>
          <Dir aaa>
            <Module test_aaa.py>
              <Function test_it>
          <Module test_a.py>
            <Function test_it>
          <Package test_b>
            <Module test_b.py>
              <Function test_it>
          <Module test_c.py>
            <Function test_it>
          <Package zzz>
            <Module test_zzz.py>
              <Function test_it>

Previously, it was:

    <Session>
      <Module top/test_a.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Module top/test_c.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Module top/aaa/test_aaa.py>
        <Function test_it>
      <Package test_b>
        <Module test_b.py>
          <Function test_it>
      <Package zzz>
        <Module test_zzz.py>
          <Function test_it>

Code/plugins which rely on a specific shape of the collection tree might need to update.

### <span class="title-ref">pytest.Package</span> is no longer a <span class="title-ref">pytest.Module</span> or <span class="title-ref">pytest.File</span>

<div class="versionchanged">

8.0

</div>

The `Package` collector node designates a Python package, that is, a directory with an <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span> file. Previously `Package` was a subtype of `pytest.Module` (which represents a single Python module), the module being the <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span> file. This has been deemed a design mistake (see `11137` and `7777` for details).

The `path` property of `Package` nodes now points to the package directory instead of the `__init__.py` file.

Note that a `Module` node for `__init__.py` (which is not a `Package`) may still exist, if it is picked up during collection (e.g. if you configured `python_files` to include `__init__.py` files).

### Collecting `__init__.py` files no longer collects package

<div class="versionremoved">

8.0

</div>

Running <span class="title-ref">pytest pkg/\_\_init\_\_.py</span> now collects the <span class="title-ref">pkg/\_\_init\_\_.py</span> file (module) only. Previously, it collected the entire <span class="title-ref">pkg</span> package, including other test files in the directory, but excluding tests in the <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span> file itself (unless `python_files` was changed to allow <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span> file).

To collect the entire package, specify just the directory: <span class="title-ref">pytest pkg</span>.

### The `pytest.collect` module

<div class="deprecated">

6.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

7.0

</div>

The `pytest.collect` module is no longer part of the public API, all its names should now be imported from `pytest` directly instead.

### The `pytest_warning_captured` hook

<div class="deprecated">

6.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

7.0

</div>

This hook has an <span class="title-ref">item</span> parameter which cannot be serialized by `pytest-xdist`.

Use the `pytest_warning_recorded` hook instead, which replaces the `item` parameter by a `nodeid` parameter.

### The `pytest._fillfuncargs` function

<div class="deprecated">

6.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

7.0

</div>

This function was kept for backward compatibility with an older plugin.

It's functionality is not meant to be used directly, but if you must replace it, use <span class="title-ref">function.\_request.\_fillfixtures()</span> instead, though note this is not a public API and may break in the future.

### `--no-print-logs` command-line option

<div class="deprecated">

5.4

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

The `--no-print-logs` option and `log_print` ini setting are removed. If you used them, please use `--show-capture` instead.

A `--show-capture` command-line option was added in `pytest 3.5.0` which allows to specify how to display captured output when tests fail: `no`, `stdout`, `stderr`, `log` or `all` (the default).

### Result log (`--result-log`)

<div class="deprecated">

4.0

</div>

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

The `--result-log` option produces a stream of test reports which can be analysed at runtime, but it uses a custom format which requires users to implement their own parser.

The [pytest-reportlog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog) plugin provides a `--report-log` option, a more standard and extensible alternative, producing one JSON object per-line, and should cover the same use cases. Please try it out and provide feedback.

The `pytest-reportlog` plugin might even be merged into the core at some point, depending on the plans for the plugins and number of users using it.

### `pytest_collect_directory` hook

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

The `pytest_collect_directory` hook has not worked properly for years (it was called but the results were ignored). Users may consider using `pytest_collection_modifyitems` instead.

### TerminalReporter.writer

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

The `TerminalReporter.writer` attribute has been deprecated and should no longer be used. This was inadvertently exposed as part of the public API of that plugin and ties it too much with `py.io.TerminalWriter`.

Plugins that used `TerminalReporter.writer` directly should instead use `TerminalReporter` methods that provide the same functionality.

### `junit_family` default value change to "xunit2"

<div class="versionchanged">

6.0

</div>

The default value of `junit_family` option will change to `xunit2` in pytest 6.0, which is an update of the old `xunit1` format and is supported by default in modern tools that manipulate this type of file (for example, Jenkins, Azure Pipelines, etc.).

Users are recommended to try the new `xunit2` format and see if their tooling that consumes the JUnit XML file supports it.

To use the new format, update your `pytest.ini`:

`` `ini     [pytest]     junit_family=xunit2  If you discover that your tooling does not support the new format, and want to keep using the ``<span class="title-ref"> legacy version, set the option to </span><span class="title-ref">legacy</span>\` instead:

`` `ini     [pytest]     junit_family=legacy  By using ``legacy`you will keep using the legacy/xunit1 format when upgrading to`<span class="title-ref"> pytest 6.0, where the default format will be </span><span class="title-ref">xunit2</span>\`.

In order to let users know about the transition, pytest will issue a warning in case the `--junit-xml` option is given in the command line but `junit_family` is not explicitly configured in `pytest.ini`.

Services known to support the `xunit2` format:

  - [Jenkins](https://www.jenkins.io/) with the [JUnit](https://plugins.jenkins.io/junit) plugin.
  - [Azure Pipelines](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/pipelines).

### Node Construction changed to `Node.from_parent`

<div class="versionchanged">

6.0

</div>

The construction of nodes now should use the named constructor `from_parent`. This limitation in api surface intends to enable better/simpler refactoring of the collection tree.

This means that instead of `MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)` one now has to invoke `MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")`.

Plugins that wish to support older versions of pytest and suppress the warning can use <span class="title-ref">hasattr</span> to check if <span class="title-ref">from\_parent</span> exists in that version:

`` `python     def pytest_pycollect_makeitem(collector, name, obj):         if hasattr(MyItem, "from_parent"):             item = MyItem.from_parent(collector, name="foo")             item.obj = 42             return item         else:             return MyItem(name="foo", parent=collector, obj=42)  Note that ``from\_parent`should only be called with keyword arguments for the parameters.`pytest.fixture`arguments are keyword only`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

Passing arguments to pytest.fixture() as positional arguments has been removed - pass them by keyword instead.

### `funcargnames` alias for `fixturenames`

<div class="versionremoved">

6.0

</div>

The `FixtureRequest`, `Metafunc`, and `Function` classes track the names of their associated fixtures, with the aptly-named `fixturenames` attribute.

Prior to pytest 2.3, this attribute was named `funcargnames`, and we have kept that as an alias since. It is finally due for removal, as it is often confusing in places where we or plugin authors must distinguish between fixture names and names supplied by non-fixture things such as `pytest.mark.parametrize`.

### `pytest.config` global

<div class="versionremoved">

5.0

</div>

The `pytest.config` global object is deprecated. Instead use `request.config` (via the `request` fixture) or if you are a plugin author use the `pytest_configure(config)` hook. Note that many hooks can also access the `config` object indirectly, through `session.config` or `item.config` for example.

### `"message"` parameter of `pytest.raises`

<div class="versionremoved">

5.0

</div>

It is a common mistake to think this parameter will match the exception message, while in fact it only serves to provide a custom message in case the `pytest.raises` check fails. To prevent users from making this mistake, and because it is believed to be little used, pytest is deprecating it without providing an alternative for the moment.

If you have a valid use case for this parameter, consider that to obtain the same results you can just call `pytest.fail` manually at the end of the `with` statement.

For example:

`` `python     with pytest.raises(TimeoutError, message="Client got unexpected message"):         wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)   Becomes:  .. code-block:: python      with pytest.raises(TimeoutError):         wait_for(websocket.recv(), 0.5)         pytest.fail("Client got unexpected message")   If you still have concerns about this deprecation and future removal, please comment on ``<span class="title-ref"> :issue:\`3974</span>.

### `raises` / `warns` with a string as the second argument

<div class="versionremoved">

5.0

</div>

Use the context manager form of these instead. When necessary, invoke `exec` directly.

Example:

`` `python     pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError, "1 / 0")     pytest.raises(SyntaxError, "a $ b")      pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning, "my_function()")     pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning, "assert(1, 2)")  Becomes:  .. code-block:: python      with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):         1 / 0     with pytest.raises(SyntaxError):         exec("a $ b")  # exec is required for invalid syntax      with pytest.warns(DeprecationWarning):         my_function()     with pytest.warns(SyntaxWarning):         exec("assert(1, 2)")  # exec is used to avoid a top-level warning     Using ``Class`in custom Collectors`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Using objects named `"Class"` as a way to customize the type of nodes that are collected in `Collector` subclasses has been deprecated. Users instead should use `pytest_pycollect_makeitem` to customize node types during collection.

This issue should affect only advanced plugins who create new collection types, so if you see this warning message please contact the authors so they can change the code.

### marks in `pytest.mark.parametrize`

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Applying marks to values of a `pytest.mark.parametrize` call is now deprecated. For example:

`` `python     @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "a, b",         [             (3, 9),             pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")(6, 36),             (10, 100),             (20, 200),             (40, 400),             (50, 500),         ],     )     def test_foo(a, b): ...  This code applies the ``pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")`mark to the`(6, 36)`value of the above parametrization`\` call.

This was considered hard to read and understand, and also its implementation presented problems to the code preventing further internal improvements in the marks architecture.

To update the code, use `pytest.param`:

`` `python     @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "a, b",         [             (3, 9),             pytest.param(6, 36, marks=pytest.mark.xfail(reason="flaky")),             (10, 100),             (20, 200),             (40, 400),             (50, 500),         ],     )     def test_foo(a, b): ...   .. _pytest_funcarg__ prefix deprecated: ``pytest\_funcarg\_\_`prefix`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

In very early pytest versions fixtures could be defined using the `pytest_funcarg__` prefix:

`` `python     def pytest_funcarg__data():         return SomeData()  Switch over to the ``@pytest.fixture`decorator:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.fixture     def data():         return SomeData()    [pytest] section in setup.cfg files`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

`[pytest]` sections in `setup.cfg` files should now be named `[tool:pytest]` to avoid conflicts with other distutils commands.

### Metafunc.addcall

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

`Metafunc.addcall` was a precursor to the current parametrized mechanism. Users should use <span class="title-ref">pytest.Metafunc.parametrize</span> instead.

Example:

`` `python     def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         metafunc.addcall({"i": 1}, id="1")         metafunc.addcall({"i": 2}, id="2")  Becomes:  .. code-block:: python      def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         metafunc.parametrize("i", [1, 2], ids=["1", "2"])   .. _cached_setup deprecated: ``cached\_setup`  `\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

`request.cached_setup` was the precursor of the setup/teardown mechanism available to fixtures.

Example:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture     def db_session():         return request.cached_setup(             setup=Session.create, teardown=lambda session: session.close(), scope="module"         )  This should be updated to make use of standard fixture mechanisms:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.fixture(scope="module")     def db_session():         session = Session.create()         yield session         session.close()   You can consult :std[funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>](funcarg comparison section in the docs <funcarg_compare>.md) for ``\` more information.

### pytest\_plugins in non-top-level conftest files

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Defining `pytest_plugins` is now deprecated in non-top-level conftest.py files because they will activate referenced plugins *globally*, which is surprising because for all other pytest features `conftest.py` files are only *active* for tests at or below it.

### `Config.warn` and `Node.warn`

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Those methods were part of the internal pytest warnings system, but since `3.8` pytest is using the builtin warning system for its own warnings, so those two functions are now deprecated.

`Config.warn` should be replaced by calls to the standard `warnings.warn`, example:

`` `python     config.warn("C1", "some warning")  Becomes:  .. code-block:: python      warnings.warn(pytest.PytestWarning("some warning")) ``Node.warn`now supports two signatures:  *`node.warn(PytestWarning("some message"))`: is now the **recommended** way to call this function.   The warning instance must be a PytestWarning or subclass.  *`node.warn("CI", "some message")`: this code/message form has been **removed** and should be converted to the warning instance form above.  .. _record_xml_property deprecated:  record_xml_property`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

The `record_xml_property` fixture is now deprecated in favor of the more generic `record_property`, which can be used by other consumers (for example `pytest-html`) to obtain custom information about the test run.

This is just a matter of renaming the fixture as the API is the same:

`` `python     def test_foo(record_xml_property): ...  Change to:  .. code-block:: python      def test_foo(record_property): ...   .. _passing command-line string to pytest.main deprecated:  Passing command-line string to ``pytest.main()`  `\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Passing a command-line string to `pytest.main()` is deprecated:

`` `python     pytest.main("-v -s")  Pass a list instead:  .. code-block:: python      pytest.main(["-v", "-s"])   By passing a string, users expect that pytest will interpret that command-line using the shell rules they are working ``<span class="title-ref"> on (for example </span><span class="title-ref">bash</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">Powershell</span>\`), but this is very hard/impossible to do in a portable way.

### Calling fixtures directly

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Calling a fixture function directly, as opposed to request them in a test function, is deprecated.

For example:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture     def cell():         return ...       @pytest.fixture     def full_cell():         cell = cell()         cell.make_full()         return cell  This is a great source of confusion to new users, which will often call the fixture functions and request them from test functions interchangeably, which breaks the fixture resolution model.  In those cases just request the function directly in the dependent fixture:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.fixture     def cell():         return ...       @pytest.fixture     def full_cell(cell):         cell.make_full()         return cell  Alternatively if the fixture function is called multiple times inside a test (making it hard to apply the above pattern) or ``<span class="title-ref"> if you would like to make minimal changes to the code, you can create a fixture which calls the original function together with the </span><span class="title-ref">name</span>\` parameter:

`` `python     def cell():         return ...       @pytest.fixture(name="cell")     def cell_fixture():         return cell()   .. _yield tests deprecated: ``yield`tests`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

pytest supported `yield`-style tests, where a test function actually `yield` functions and values that are then turned into proper test methods. Example:

`` `python     def check(x, y):         assert x**x == y       def test_squared():         yield check, 2, 4         yield check, 3, 9  This would result into two actual test functions being generated.  This form of test function doesn't support fixtures properly, and users should switch to ``pytest.mark.parametrize`:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [(2, 4), (3, 9)])     def test_squared(x, y):         assert x**x == y  .. _internal classes accessed through node deprecated:  Internal classes accessed through`Node`  `\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

Access of `Module`, `Function`, `Class`, `Instance`, `File` and `Item` through `Node` instances now issue this warning:

`` `text     usage of Function.Module is deprecated, please use pytest.Module instead  Users should just ``import pytest`and access those objects using the`pytest`module.  This has been documented as deprecated for years, but only now we are actually emitting deprecation warnings.`Node.get\_marker`  `\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

As part of a large \[marker-revamp\](\#marker-revamp), `_pytest.nodes.Node.get_marker` is removed. See \[the documentation \<update marker code\>\](\#the-documentation-\<update-marker-code\>) on tips on how to update your code.

### `somefunction.markname`

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

As part of a large \[marker-revamp\](\#marker-revamp) we already deprecated using `MarkInfo` the only correct way to get markers of an element is via `node.iter_markers(name)`.

### `pytest_namespace`

<div class="versionremoved">

4.0

</div>

This hook is deprecated because it greatly complicates the pytest internals regarding configuration and initialization, making some bug fixes and refactorings impossible.

Example of usage:

`` `python     class MySymbol: ...       def pytest_namespace():         return {"my_symbol": MySymbol()}   Plugin authors relying on this hook should instead require that users now import the plugin modules directly (with an appropriate public API).  As a stopgap measure, plugin authors may still inject their names into pytest's namespace, usually during ``pytest\_configure`:  .. code-block:: python      import pytest       def pytest_configure():         pytest.my_symbol = MySymbol()`\`

            pytest.skip("specify -A to run acceptance tests")
        self.tmpdir = request.config.mktemp(request.function.__name__, numbered=True)

    def run(self, *cmd):
        """called by test code to execute an acceptance test."""
        self.tmpdir.chdir()
        return subprocess.check_output(cmd).decode()
```

and the actual test function example:

``` python
def test_some_acceptance_aspect(accept):
    accept.tmpdir.mkdir("somesub")
    result = accept.run("ls", "-la")
    assert "somesub" in result
```

If you run this test without specifying a command line option the test will get skipped with an appropriate message. Otherwise you can start to add convenience and test support methods to your AcceptFixture and drive running of tools or applications and provide ways to do assertions about the output.

# example: decorating a funcarg in a test module

For larger scale setups it's sometimes useful to decorate a funcarg just for a particular test module. We can extend the [accept example](#accept%20example) by putting this in our test module:

``` python
def pytest_funcarg__accept(request):
    # call the next factory (living in our conftest.py)
    arg = request.getfuncargvalue("accept")
    # create a special layout in our tempdir
    arg.tmpdir.mkdir("special")
    return arg

class TestSpecialAcceptance:
    def test_sometest(self, accept):
        assert accept.tmpdir.join("special").check()
```

Our module level factory will be invoked first and it can ask its request object to call the next factory and then decorate its result. This mechanism allows us to stay ignorant of how/where the function argument is provided -in our example from a [conftest plugin](customize.html#conftestplugin).

sidenote: the temporary directory used here are instances of the [py.path.local](../path.html#local) class which provides many of the os.path methods in a convenient way.

# Using a custom directory collector

By default, pytest collects directories using <span class="title-ref">pytest.Package</span>, for directories with `__init__.py` files, and <span class="title-ref">pytest.Dir</span> for other directories. If you want to customize how a directory is collected, you can write your own <span class="title-ref">pytest.Directory</span> collector, and use `pytest_collect_directory` to hook it up.

## A basic example for a directory manifest file

Suppose you want to customize how collection is done on a per-directory basis. Here is an example `conftest.py` plugin that allows directories to contain a `manifest.json` file, which defines how the collection should be done for the directory. In this example, only a simple list of files is supported, however you can imagine adding other keys, such as exclusions and globs.

\# content of conftest.py from \_\_future\_\_ import annotations

import json

import pytest

  - class ManifestDirectory(pytest.Directory):
    
      - def collect(self):  
        \# The standard pytest behavior is to loop over all <span class="title-ref">test\_\*.py</span> files and \# call <span class="title-ref">pytest\_collect\_file</span> on each file. This collector instead reads \# the <span class="title-ref">manifest.json</span> file and only calls <span class="title-ref">pytest\_collect\_file</span> for the \# files defined there. manifest\_path = self.path / "manifest.json" manifest = json.loads(manifest\_path.read\_text(encoding="utf-8")) ihook = self.ihook for file in manifest\["files"\]: yield from ihook.pytest\_collect\_file( file\_path=self.path / file, parent=self )

@pytest.hookimpl def pytest\_collect\_directory(path, parent): \# Use our custom collector for directories containing a <span class="title-ref">manifest.json</span> file. if path.joinpath("manifest.json").is\_file(): return ManifestDirectory.from\_parent(parent=parent, path=path) \# Otherwise fallback to the standard behavior. return None

>   - literal

You can create a `manifest.json` file and some test files:

  - {
    
      - "files": \[  
        "test\_first.py", "test\_second.py"
    
    \]

}

>   - literal

\# content of test\_first.py from \_\_future\_\_ import annotations

  - def test\_1():  
    pass
    
      - literal

\# content of test\_second.py from \_\_future\_\_ import annotations

  - def test\_2():  
    pass
    
      - literal

\# content of test\_third.py from \_\_future\_\_ import annotations

  - def test\_3():  
    pass
    
      - literal

An you can now execute the test specification:

# Working with custom markers

Here are some examples using the \[mark\](\#mark) mechanism.

## Marking test functions and selecting them for a run

You can "mark" a test function with custom metadata like this:

`` `python     # content of test_server.py      import pytest       @pytest.mark.webtest     def test_send_http():         pass  # perform some webtest test for your app       @pytest.mark.device(serial="123")     def test_something_quick():         pass       @pytest.mark.device(serial="abc")     def test_another():         pass       class TestClass:         def test_method(self):             pass    You can then restrict a test run to only run tests marked with ``webtest``:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v -m webtest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 4 items / 3 deselected / 1 selected      test_server.py::test_send_http PASSED                                [100%]      ===================== 1 passed, 3 deselected in 0.12s ======================  Or the inverse, running all tests except the webtest ones:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v -m "not webtest"     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 4 items / 1 deselected / 3 selected      test_server.py::test_something_quick PASSED                          [ 33%]     test_server.py::test_another PASSED                                  [ 66%]     test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]      ===================== 3 passed, 1 deselected in 0.12s ======================  .. _`marker_keyword_expression_example`:  Additionally, you can restrict a test run to only run tests matching one or multiple marker``<span class="title-ref"> keyword arguments, e.g. to run only tests marked with </span><span class="title-ref">device</span><span class="title-ref"> and the specific </span><span class="title-ref">serial="123"</span>\`:

Selecting tests based on their node ID ``\` --------------------------------------

You can provide one or more \[node IDs \<node-id\>\](\#node-ids-\<node-id\>) as positional arguments to select only specified tests. This makes it easy to select tests based on their module, class, method, or function name:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass::test_method     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 1 item      test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]      ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================  You can also select on the class:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 1 item      test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [100%]      ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================  Or select multiple nodes:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v test_server.py::TestClass test_server.py::test_send_http     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 2 items      test_server.py::TestClass::test_method PASSED                        [ 50%]     test_server.py::test_send_http PASSED                                [100%]      ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================  .. _node-id:  > **Note** >      Node IDs are of the form ``module.py::class::method`or`module.py::function`.  Node IDs control which tests are     collected, so`module.py::class`will select all test methods     on the class.  Nodes are also created for each parameter of a     parametrized fixture or test, so selecting a parametrized test     must include the parameter value, e.g.`module.py::function\[param\]`.      Node IDs for failing tests are displayed in the test summary info     when running pytest with the`-rf`option.  You can also     construct Node IDs from the output of`pytest --collect-only`.  Using`-k expr`to select tests based on their name`\` -------------------------------------------------------

<div class="versionadded">

2.0/2.3.4

</div>

You can use the `-k` command line option to specify an expression which implements a substring match on the test names instead of the exact match on markers that `-m` provides. This makes it easy to select tests based on their names:

<div class="versionchanged">

5.4

</div>

The expression matching is now case-insensitive.

In addition to the test's name,`-k`also matches the names of the test's parents (usually, the name of the file and class it's in),`<span class="title-ref"> attributes set on the test function, markers applied to it or its parents and any \`extra keywords \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.extra\_keyword\_matches\></span> explicitly added to it or its parents.

## Registering markers

Registering markers for your test suite is simple:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     markers =         webtest: mark a test as a webtest.         slow: mark test as slow.  Multiple custom markers can be registered, by defining each one in its own line, as shown in above example.  You can ask which markers exist for your test suite - the list includes our just defined ``webtest`and`slow`markers:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest --markers     @pytest.mark.webtest: mark a test as a webtest.      @pytest.mark.slow: mark test as slow.      @pytest.mark.filterwarnings(warning): add a warning filter to the given test. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html#pytest-mark-filterwarnings      @pytest.mark.skip(reason=None): skip the given test function with an optional reason. Example: skip(reason="no way of currently testing this") skips the test.      @pytest.mark.skipif(condition, ..., *, reason=...): skip the given test function if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Example: skipif(sys.platform == 'win32') skips the test if we are on the win32 platform. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-skipif      @pytest.mark.xfail(condition, ..., *, reason=..., run=True, raises=None, strict=xfail_strict): mark the test function as an expected failure if any of the conditions evaluate to True. Optionally specify a reason for better reporting and run=False if you don't even want to execute the test function. If only specific exception(s) are expected, you can list them in raises, and if the test fails in other ways, it will be reported as a true failure. See https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytest-mark-xfail      @pytest.mark.parametrize(argnames, argvalues): call a test function multiple times passing in different arguments in turn. argvalues generally needs to be a list of values if argnames specifies only one name or a list of tuples of values if argnames specifies multiple names. Example: @parametrize('arg1', [1,2]) would lead to two calls of the decorated test function, one with arg1=1 and another with arg1=2.see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/parametrize.html for more info and examples.      @pytest.mark.usefixtures(fixturename1, fixturename2, ...): mark tests as needing all of the specified fixtures. see https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/explanation/fixtures.html#usefixtures      @pytest.mark.tryfirst: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it first/as early as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True) instead.      @pytest.mark.trylast: mark a hook implementation function such that the plugin machinery will try to call it last/as late as possible. DEPRECATED, use @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True) instead.   For an example on how to add and work with markers from a plugin, see`\` \[adding a custom marker from a plugin\](\#adding-a-custom-marker-from-a-plugin).

\> **Note** \> It is recommended to explicitly register markers so that:

>   - There is one place in your test suite defining your markers
>   - Asking for existing markers via `pytest --markers` gives good output
>   - Typos in function markers are treated as an error if you use the `--strict-markers` option.

## Marking whole classes or modules

You may use `pytest.mark` decorators with classes to apply markers to all of its test methods:

`` `python     # content of test_mark_classlevel.py     import pytest       @pytest.mark.webtest     class TestClass:         def test_startup(self):             pass          def test_startup_and_more(self):             pass  This is equivalent to directly applying the decorator to the ``\` two test functions.

To apply marks at the module level, use the `pytestmark` global variable:

    import pytest
    pytestmark = pytest.mark.webtest

or multiple markers:

    pytestmark = [pytest.mark.webtest, pytest.mark.slowtest]

Due to legacy reasons, before class decorators were introduced, it is possible to set the `pytestmark` attribute on a test class like this:

`` `python     import pytest       class TestClass:         pytestmark = pytest.mark.webtest  .. _`marking individual tests when using parametrize`:  Marking individual tests when using parametrize ``\` -----------------------------------------------

When using parametrize, applying a mark will make it apply to each individual test. However it is also possible to apply a marker to an individual test instance:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.mark.foo     @pytest.mark.parametrize(         ("n", "expected"), [(1, 2), pytest.param(1, 3, marks=pytest.mark.bar), (2, 3)]     )     def test_increment(n, expected):         assert n + 1 == expected  In this example the mark "foo" will apply to each of the three ``\` tests, whereas the "bar" mark is only applied to the second test. Skip and xfail marks can also be applied in this way, see \[skip/xfail with parametrize\](\#skip/xfail-with-parametrize).

## Custom marker and command line option to control test runs

Plugins can provide custom markers and implement specific behaviour based on it. This is a self-contained example which adds a command line option and a parametrized test function marker to run tests specified via named environments:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import pytest       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "-E",             action="store",             metavar="NAME",             help="only run tests matching the environment NAME.",         )       def pytest_configure(config):         # register an additional marker         config.addinivalue_line(             "markers", "env(name): mark test to run only on named environment"         )       def pytest_runtest_setup(item):         envnames = [mark.args[0] for mark in item.iter_markers(name="env")]         if envnames:             if item.config.getoption("-E") not in envnames:                 pytest.skip(f"test requires env in {envnames!r}")  A test file using this local plugin:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_someenv.py      import pytest       @pytest.mark.env("stage1")     def test_basic_db_operation():         pass  and an example invocations specifying a different environment than what ``\` the test needs:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import sys       def pytest_runtest_setup(item):         for marker in item.iter_markers(name="my_marker"):             print(marker)             sys.stdout.flush()  A custom marker can have its argument set, i.e. ``args`and`kwargs`properties, defined by either invoking it as a callable or using`pytest.mark.MARKER\_NAME.with\_args`. These two methods achieve the same effect most of the time.  However, if there is a callable as the single positional argument with no keyword arguments, using the`pytest.mark.MARKER\_NAME(c)`will not pass`c`as a positional argument but decorate`c`with the custom marker (see [MarkDecorator <mark>](#markdecorator-<mark>)). Fortunately,`pytest.mark.MARKER\_NAME.with\_args`comes to the rescue:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_custom_marker.py     import pytest       def hello_world(*args, **kwargs):         return "Hello World"       @pytest.mark.my_marker.with_args(hello_world)     def test_with_args():         pass  The output is as follows:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q -s     Mark(name='my_marker', args=(<function hello_world at 0xdeadbeef0001>,), kwargs={})     .     1 passed in 0.12s  We can see that the custom marker has its argument set extended with the function`hello\_world`. This is the key difference between creating a custom marker as a callable, which invokes`\_\_call\_\_`behind the scenes, and using`with\_args`.   Reading markers which were set from multiple places`\` ----------------------------------------------------

If you are heavily using markers in your test suite you may encounter the case where a marker is applied several times to a test function. From plugin code you can read over all such settings. Example:

`` `python     # content of test_mark_three_times.py     import pytest      pytestmark = pytest.mark.glob("module", x=1)       @pytest.mark.glob("class", x=2)     class TestClass:         @pytest.mark.glob("function", x=3)         def test_something(self):             pass  Here we have the marker "glob" applied three times to the same ``\` test function. From a conftest file we can read it like this:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import sys       def pytest_runtest_setup(item):         for mark in item.iter_markers(name="glob"):             print(f"glob args={mark.args} kwargs={mark.kwargs}")             sys.stdout.flush()  Let's run this without capturing output and see what we get:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q -s     glob args=('function',) kwargs={'x': 3}     glob args=('class',) kwargs={'x': 2}     glob args=('module',) kwargs={'x': 1}     .     1 passed in 0.12s  Marking platform specific tests with pytest ``\` --------------------------------------------------------------

Consider you have a test suite which marks tests for particular platforms, namely `pytest.mark.darwin`, `pytest.mark.win32` etc. and you also have tests that run on all platforms and have no specific marker. If you now want to have a way to only run the tests for your particular platform, you could use the following plugin:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     #     import sys      import pytest      ALL = set("darwin linux win32".split())       def pytest_runtest_setup(item):         supported_platforms = ALL.intersection(mark.name for mark in item.iter_markers())         plat = sys.platform         if supported_platforms and plat not in supported_platforms:             pytest.skip(f"cannot run on platform {plat}")  then tests will be skipped if they were specified for a different platform. ``\` Let's do a little test file to show how this looks like:

`` `python     # content of test_plat.py      import pytest       @pytest.mark.darwin     def test_if_apple_is_evil():         pass       @pytest.mark.linux     def test_if_linux_works():         pass       @pytest.mark.win32     def test_if_win32_crashes():         pass       def test_runs_everywhere():         pass  then you will see two tests skipped and two executed tests as expected:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -rs # this option reports skip reasons     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 4 items      test_plat.py s.s.

Automatically adding markers based on test names ``\` --------------------------------------------------------

If you have a test suite where test function names indicate a certain type of test, you can implement a hook that automatically defines markers so that you can use the `-m` option with it. Let's look at this test module:

`` `python     # content of test_module.py       def test_interface_simple():         assert 0       def test_interface_complex():         assert 0       def test_event_simple():         assert 0       def test_something_else():         assert 0  We want to dynamically define two markers and can do it in a ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\` plugin:

# Working with non-python tests

## A basic example for specifying tests in Yaml files

Here is an example `conftest.py` (extracted from Ali Afshar's special purpose [pytest-yamlwsgi](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-yamlwsgi/) plugin). This `conftest.py` will collect `test*.yaml` files and will execute the yaml-formatted content as custom tests:

\# content of conftest.py from \_\_future\_\_ import annotations

import pytest

  - def pytest\_collect\_file(parent, file\_path):
    
      - if file\_path.suffix == ".yaml" and file\_path.name.startswith("test"):  
        return YamlFile.from\_parent(parent, path=file\_path)

  - class YamlFile(pytest.File):
    
      - def collect(self):  
        \# We need a yaml parser, e.g. PyYAML. import yaml
        
        raw = yaml.safe\_load(self.path.open(encoding="utf-8")) for name, spec in sorted(raw.items()): yield YamlItem.from\_parent(self, name=name, spec=spec)

  - class YamlItem(pytest.Item):
    
      - def \_\_init\_\_(self, *, spec,kwargs): super().\_\_init\_\_(*\*kwargs)  
        self.spec = spec
    
      - def runtest(self):
        
          - for name, value in sorted(self.spec.items()):  
            \# Some custom test execution (dumb example follows). if name \!= value: raise YamlException(self, name, value)
    
      - def repr\_failure(self, excinfo):  
        """Called when self.runtest() raises an exception.""" if isinstance(excinfo.value, YamlException): return "n".join( \[ "usecase execution failed", " spec failed: {1\!r}: {2\!r}".format(\*excinfo.value.args), " no further details known at this point.", \] ) return super().repr\_failure(excinfo)
    
      - def reportinfo(self):  
        return self.path, 0, f"usecase: {self.name}"

  - class YamlException(Exception):  
    """Custom exception for error reporting."""
    
      - literal

You can create a simple example file:

\# test\_simple.yaml ok: sub1: sub1

  - hello:  
    world: world some: other
    
      - literal

and if you installed `PyYAML` or a compatible YAML-parser you can now execute the test specification:

`` `pytest     nonpython $ pytest test_simple.yaml     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project/nonpython     collected 2 items      test_simple.yaml F.                                                  [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ usecase: hello ______________________________     usecase execution failed        spec failed: 'some': 'other'        no further details known at this point.     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_simple.yaml::hello     ======================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================  .. regendoc:wipe  You get one dot for the passing ``sub1: sub1`check and one failure.`<span class="title-ref"> Obviously in the above </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\` you'll want to implement a more interesting interpretation of the yaml-values. You can easily write your own domain specific testing language this way.

\> **Note** \> `repr_failure(excinfo)` is called for representing test failures. If you create custom collection nodes you can return an error representation string of your choice. It will be reported as a (red) string.

`reportinfo()` is used for representing the test location and is also consulted when reporting in `verbose` mode:

`` `pytest     nonpython $ pytest -v     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project/nonpython     collecting ... collected 2 items      test_simple.yaml::hello FAILED                                       [ 50%]     test_simple.yaml::ok PASSED                                          [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ usecase: hello ______________________________     usecase execution failed        spec failed: 'some': 'other'        no further details known at this point.     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_simple.yaml::hello     ======================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================  .. regendoc:wipe  While developing your custom test collection and execution it's also ``\` interesting to just look at the collection tree:

# Parametrizing tests

`pytest` allows to easily parametrize test functions. For basic docs, see \[parametrize-basics\](\#parametrize-basics).

In the following we provide some examples using the builtin mechanisms.

## Generating parameters combinations, depending on command line

Let's say we want to execute a test with different computation parameters and the parameter range shall be determined by a command line argument. Let's first write a simple (do-nothing) computation test:

`` `python     # content of test_compute.py       def test_compute(param1):         assert param1 < 4  Now we add a test configuration like this:  .. code-block:: python      # content of conftest.py       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption("--all", action="store_true", help="run all combinations")       def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         if "param1" in metafunc.fixturenames:             if metafunc.config.getoption("all"):                 end = 5             else:                 end = 2             metafunc.parametrize("param1", range(end))  This means that we only run 2 tests if we do not pass ``--all`:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q test_compute.py     ..                                                                   [100%]     2 passed in 0.12s  We run only two computations, so we see two dots.`\` let's run the full monty:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q --all     ....F                                                                [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     _____________________________ test_compute[4] ______________________________      param1 = 4          def test_compute(param1):     >       assert param1 < 4     E       assert 4 < 4      test_compute.py:4: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_compute.py::test_compute[4] - assert 4 < 4     1 failed, 4 passed in 0.12s  As expected when running the full range of ``param1`values`\` we'll get an error on the last one.

## Different options for test IDs

pytest will build a string that is the test ID for each set of values in a parametrized test. These IDs can be used with `-k` to select specific cases to run, and they will also identify the specific case when one is failing. Running pytest with `--collect-only` will show the generated IDs.

Numbers, strings, booleans and None will have their usual string representation used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will make a string based on the argument name:

`` `python     # content of test_time.py      from datetime import datetime, timedelta      import pytest      testdata = [         (datetime(2001, 12, 12), datetime(2001, 12, 11), timedelta(1)),         (datetime(2001, 12, 11), datetime(2001, 12, 12), timedelta(-1)),     ]       @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata)     def test_timedistance_v0(a, b, expected):         diff = a - b         assert diff == expected       @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata, ids=["forward", "backward"])     def test_timedistance_v1(a, b, expected):         diff = a - b         assert diff == expected       def idfn(val):         if isinstance(val, (datetime,)):             # note this wouldn't show any hours/minutes/seconds             return val.strftime("%Y%m%d")       @pytest.mark.parametrize("a,b,expected", testdata, ids=idfn)     def test_timedistance_v2(a, b, expected):         diff = a - b         assert diff == expected       @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "a,b,expected",         [             pytest.param(                 datetime(2001, 12, 12), datetime(2001, 12, 11), timedelta(1), id="forward"             ),             pytest.param(                 datetime(2001, 12, 11), datetime(2001, 12, 12), timedelta(-1), id="backward"             ),         ],     )     def test_timedistance_v3(a, b, expected):         diff = a - b         assert diff == expected  In ``test\_timedistance\_v0`, we let pytest generate the test IDs.  In`test\_timedistance\_v1`, we specified`ids`as a list of strings which were`\` used as the test IDs. These are succinct, but can be a pain to maintain.

In `test_timedistance_v2`, we specified `ids` as a function that can generate a string representation to make part of the test ID. So our `datetime` values use the label generated by `idfn`, but because we didn't generate a label for `timedelta` objects, they are still using the default pytest representation:

`` `pytest     $ pytest test_time.py --collect-only     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 8 items      <Dir parametrize.rst-204>       <Module test_time.py>         <Function test_timedistance_v0[a0-b0-expected0]>         <Function test_timedistance_v0[a1-b1-expected1]>         <Function test_timedistance_v1[forward]>         <Function test_timedistance_v1[backward]>         <Function test_timedistance_v2[20011212-20011211-expected0]>         <Function test_timedistance_v2[20011211-20011212-expected1]>         <Function test_timedistance_v3[forward]>         <Function test_timedistance_v3[backward]>      ======================== 8 tests collected in 0.12s ========================  In ``test\_timedistance\_v3`, we used`pytest.param`to specify the test IDs`\` together with the actual data, instead of listing them separately.

## A quick port of "testscenarios"

Here is a quick port to run tests configured with `testscenarios`, an add-on from Robert Collins for the standard unittest framework. We only have to work a bit to construct the correct arguments for pytest's :py\`Metafunc.parametrize \<pytest.Metafunc.parametrize\>\`:

`` `python     # content of test_scenarios.py       def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         idlist = []         argvalues = []         for scenario in metafunc.cls.scenarios:             idlist.append(scenario[0])             items = scenario[1].items()             argnames = [x[0] for x in items]             argvalues.append([x[1] for x in items])         metafunc.parametrize(argnames, argvalues, ids=idlist, scope="class")       scenario1 = ("basic", {"attribute": "value"})     scenario2 = ("advanced", {"attribute": "value2"})       class TestSampleWithScenarios:         scenarios = [scenario1, scenario2]          def test_demo1(self, attribute):             assert isinstance(attribute, str)          def test_demo2(self, attribute):             assert isinstance(attribute, str)  this is a fully self-contained example which you can run with:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_scenarios.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 4 items      test_scenarios.py ....                                               [100%]      ============================ 4 passed in 0.12s =============================  If you just collect tests you'll also nicely see 'advanced' and 'basic' as variants for the test function:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest --collect-only test_scenarios.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 4 items      <Dir parametrize.rst-204>       <Module test_scenarios.py>         <Class TestSampleWithScenarios>           <Function test_demo1[basic]>           <Function test_demo2[basic]>           <Function test_demo1[advanced]>           <Function test_demo2[advanced]>      ======================== 4 tests collected in 0.12s ========================  Note that we told ``metafunc.parametrize()`that your scenario values`\` should be considered class-scoped. With pytest-2.3 this leads to a resource-based ordering.

## Deferring the setup of parametrized resources

The parametrization of test functions happens at collection time. It is a good idea to setup expensive resources like DB connections or subprocess only when the actual test is run. Here is a simple example how you can achieve that. This test requires a `db` object fixture:

`` `python     # content of test_backends.py      import pytest       def test_db_initialized(db):         # a dummy test         if db.__class__.__name__ == "DB2":             pytest.fail("deliberately failing for demo purposes")  We can now add a test configuration that generates two invocations of ``<span class="title-ref"> the </span><span class="title-ref">test\_db\_initialized</span>\` function and also implements a factory that creates a database object for the actual test invocations:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import pytest       def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         if "db" in metafunc.fixturenames:             metafunc.parametrize("db", ["d1", "d2"], indirect=True)       class DB1:         "one database object"       class DB2:         "alternative database object"       @pytest.fixture     def db(request):         if request.param == "d1":             return DB1()         elif request.param == "d2":             return DB2()         else:             raise ValueError("invalid internal test config")  Let's first see how it looks like at collection time:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_backends.py --collect-only     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      <Dir parametrize.rst-204>       <Module test_backends.py>         <Function test_db_initialized[d1]>         <Function test_db_initialized[d2]>      ======================== 2 tests collected in 0.12s ========================  And then when we run the test:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q test_backends.py     .F                                                                   [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     _________________________ test_db_initialized[d2] __________________________      db = <conftest.DB2 object at 0xdeadbeef0001>          def test_db_initialized(db):             # a dummy test             if db.__class__.__name__ == "DB2":     >           pytest.fail("deliberately failing for demo purposes")     E           Failed: deliberately failing for demo purposes      test_backends.py:8: Failed     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_backends.py::test_db_initialized[d2] - Failed: deliberately f...     1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s  The first invocation with ``db == "DB1"`passed while the second with`db == "DB2"`failed.  Our`db`fixture function has instantiated each of the DB values during the setup phase while the`pytest\_generate\_tests`generated two according calls to the`test\_db\_initialized`during the collection phase.  Indirect parametrization`\` ---------------------------------------------------

Using the `indirect=True` parameter when parametrizing a test allows to parametrize a test with a fixture receiving the values before passing them to a test:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def fixt(request):         return request.param * 3       @pytest.mark.parametrize("fixt", ["a", "b"], indirect=True)     def test_indirect(fixt):         assert len(fixt) == 3  This can be used, for example, to do more expensive setup at test run time in ``\` the fixture, rather than having to run those setup steps at collection time.

## Apply indirect on particular arguments

Very often parametrization uses more than one argument name. There is opportunity to apply `indirect` parameter on particular arguments. It can be done by passing list or tuple of arguments' names to `indirect`. In the example below there is a function `test_indirect` which uses two fixtures: `x` and `y`. Here we give to indirect the list, which contains the name of the fixture `x`. The indirect parameter will be applied to this argument only, and the value `a` will be passed to respective fixture function:

`` `python     # content of test_indirect_list.py      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="function")     def x(request):         return request.param * 3       @pytest.fixture(scope="function")     def y(request):         return request.param * 2       @pytest.mark.parametrize("x, y", [("a", "b")], indirect=["x"])     def test_indirect(x, y):         assert x == "aaa"         assert y == "b"  The result of this test will be successful:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v test_indirect_list.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 1 item      test_indirect_list.py::test_indirect[a-b] PASSED                     [100%]      ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================  .. regendoc:wipe  Parametrizing test methods through per-class configuration ``\` --------------------------------------------------------------

Here is an example `pytest_generate_tests` function implementing a parametrization scheme similar to Michael Foord's [unittest parametrizer](https://github.com/testing-cabal/unittest-ext/blob/master/params.py) but in a lot less code:

`` `python     # content of ./test_parametrize.py     import pytest       def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         # called once per each test function         funcarglist = metafunc.cls.params[metafunc.function.__name__]         argnames = sorted(funcarglist[0])         metafunc.parametrize(             argnames, [[funcargs[name] for name in argnames] for funcargs in funcarglist]         )       class TestClass:         # a map specifying multiple argument sets for a test method         params = {             "test_equals": [dict(a=1, b=2), dict(a=3, b=3)],             "test_zerodivision": [dict(a=1, b=0)],         }          def test_equals(self, a, b):             assert a == b          def test_zerodivision(self, a, b):             with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):                 a / b  Our test generator looks up a class-level definition which specifies which ``\` argument sets to use for each test function. Let's run it:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q     F..

Here is a stripped down real-life example of using parametrized testing for testing serialization of objects between different python interpreters. We define a `test_basic_objects` function which is to be run with different sets of arguments for its three arguments:

  - `python1`: first python interpreter, run to pickle-dump an object to a file
  - `python2`: second interpreter, run to pickle-load an object from a file
  - `obj`: object to be dumped/loaded

<div class="literalinclude">

multipython.py

</div>

Running it results in some skips if we don't have all the python interpreters installed and otherwise runs all combinations (3 interpreters times 3 interpreters times 3 objects to serialize/deserialize):

`` `pytest    . $ pytest -rs -q multipython.py    ssssssssssss...ssssssssssss                                          [100%]    ========================= short test summary info ==========================    SKIPPED [12] multipython.py:67: 'python3.9' not found    SKIPPED [12] multipython.py:67: 'python3.11' not found    3 passed, 24 skipped in 0.12s  Parametrization of optional implementations/imports ``\` ---------------------------------------------------

If you want to compare the outcomes of several implementations of a given API, you can write test functions that receive the already imported implementations and get skipped in case the implementation is not importable/available. Let's say we have a "base" implementation and the other (possibly optimized ones) need to provide similar results:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="session")     def basemod(request):         return pytest.importorskip("base")       @pytest.fixture(scope="session", params=["opt1", "opt2"])     def optmod(request):         return pytest.importorskip(request.param)  And then a base implementation of a simple function:  .. code-block:: python      # content of base.py     def func1():         return 1  And an optimized version:  .. code-block:: python      # content of opt1.py     def func1():         return 1.0001  And finally a little test module:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_module.py       def test_func1(basemod, optmod):         assert round(basemod.func1(), 3) == round(optmod.func1(), 3)   If you run this with reporting for skips enabled:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -rs test_module.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py .s                                                    [100%]      ========================= short test summary info ==========================     SKIPPED [1] test_module.py:3: could not import 'opt2': No module named 'opt2'     ======================= 1 passed, 1 skipped in 0.12s =======================  You'll see that we don't have an ``opt2`module and thus the second test run`<span class="title-ref"> of our </span><span class="title-ref">test\_func1</span>\` was skipped. A few notes:

  - the fixture functions in the `conftest.py` file are "session-scoped" because we don't need to import more than once
  - if you have multiple test functions and a skipped import, you will see the `[1]` count increasing in the report
  - you can put \[@pytest.mark.parametrize \<@pytest.mark.parametrize\>\](\#@pytest.mark.parametrize-\<@pytest.mark.parametrize\>) style parametrization on the test functions to parametrize input/output values as well.

## Set marks or test ID for individual parametrized test

Use `pytest.param` to apply marks or set test ID to individual parametrized test. For example:

`` `python     # content of test_pytest_param_example.py     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "test_input,expected",         [             ("3+5", 8),             pytest.param("1+7", 8, marks=pytest.mark.basic),             pytest.param("2+4", 6, marks=pytest.mark.basic, id="basic_2+4"),             pytest.param(                 "6*9", 42, marks=[pytest.mark.basic, pytest.mark.xfail], id="basic_6*9"             ),         ],     )     def test_eval(test_input, expected):         assert eval(test_input) == expected  In this example, we have 4 parametrized tests. Except for the first test, ``<span class="title-ref"> we mark the rest three parametrized tests with the custom marker </span><span class="title-ref">basic</span><span class="title-ref">, and for the fourth test we also use the built-in mark </span><span class="title-ref">xfail</span>\` to indicate this test is expected to fail. For explicitness, we set test ids for some tests.

Then run `pytest` with verbose mode and with only the `basic` marker:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -v -m basic     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 24 items / 21 deselected / 3 selected      test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[1+7-8] PASSED                [ 33%]     test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[basic_2+4] PASSED            [ 66%]     test_pytest_param_example.py::test_eval[basic_6*9] XFAIL             [100%]      =============== 2 passed, 21 deselected, 1 xfailed in 0.12s ================  As the result:  - Four tests were collected ``<span class="title-ref"> - One test was deselected because it doesn't have the </span><span class="title-ref">basic</span><span class="title-ref"> mark. - Three tests with the </span><span class="title-ref">basic</span><span class="title-ref"> mark was selected. - The test </span><span class="title-ref">test\_eval\[1+7-8\]</span><span class="title-ref"> passed, but the name is autogenerated and confusing. - The test </span><span class="title-ref">test\_eval\[basic\_2+4\]</span><span class="title-ref"> passed. - The test </span><span class="title-ref">test\_eval\[basic\_6\*9\]</span>\` was expected to fail and did fail.

## Parametrizing conditional raising

Use <span class="title-ref">pytest.raises</span> with the \[pytest.mark.parametrize ref\](\#pytest.mark.parametrize-ref) decorator to write parametrized tests in which some tests raise exceptions and others do not.

`contextlib.nullcontext` can be used to test cases that are not expected to raise exceptions but that should result in some value. The value is given as the `enter_result` parameter, which will be available as the `with` statement’s target (`e` in the example below).

For example:

`` `python     from contextlib import nullcontext      import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "example_input,expectation",         [             (3, nullcontext(2)),             (2, nullcontext(3)),             (1, nullcontext(6)),             (0, pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError)),         ],     )     def test_division(example_input, expectation):         """Test how much I know division."""         with expectation as e:             assert (6 / example_input) == e  In the example above, the first three test cases should run without any ``<span class="title-ref"> exceptions, while the fourth should raise a </span><span class="title-ref">ZeroDivisionError</span>\` exception, which is expected by pytest.

# Changing standard (Python) test discovery

## Ignore paths during test collection

You can easily ignore certain test directories and modules during collection by passing the `--ignore=path` option on the cli. `pytest` allows multiple `--ignore` options. Example:

`` `text     tests/     |-- example     |   |-- test_example_01.py     |   |-- test_example_02.py     |   '-- test_example_03.py     |-- foobar     |   |-- test_foobar_01.py     |   |-- test_foobar_02.py     |   '-- test_foobar_03.py     '-- hello         '-- world             |-- test_world_01.py             |-- test_world_02.py             '-- test_world_03.py  Now if you invoke ``pytest`with`--ignore=tests/foobar/test\_foobar\_03.py --ignore=tests/hello/`,`<span class="title-ref"> you will see that </span><span class="title-ref">pytest</span>\` only collects test-modules, which do not match the patterns specified:

`` `pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-5.x.y, py-1.x.y, pluggy-0.x.y     rootdir: $REGENDOC_TMPDIR, inifile:     collected 5 items      tests/example/test_example_01.py .

## Deselect tests during test collection

Tests can individually be deselected during collection by passing the `--deselect=item` option. For example, say `tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py` contains `test_a` and `test_b`. You can run all of the tests within `tests/` *except* for `tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a` by invoking `pytest` with `--deselect tests/foobar/test_foobar_01.py::test_a`. `pytest` allows multiple `--deselect` options.

## Keeping duplicate paths specified from command line

Default behavior of `pytest` is to ignore duplicate paths specified from the command line. Example:

`` `pytest     pytest path_a path_a      ...     collected 1 item     ...  Just collect tests once.  To collect duplicate tests, use the ``--keep-duplicates`option on the cli.`\` Example:

`` `pytest     pytest --keep-duplicates path_a path_a      ...     collected 2 items     ...  As the collector just works on directories, if you specify twice a single test file, ``pytest`will`<span class="title-ref"> still collect it twice, no matter if the </span><span class="title-ref">--keep-duplicates</span>\` is not specified. Example:

`` `pytest     pytest test_a.py test_a.py      ...     collected 2 items     ...   Changing directory recursion ``\` -----------------------------------------------------

You can set the `norecursedirs` option in an ini-file, for example your `pytest.ini` in the project root directory:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     norecursedirs = .svn _build tmp*  This would tell ``pytest`to not recurse into typical subversion or sphinx-build directories or into any`tmp``prefixed directory.  .. _`change naming conventions`:  Changing naming conventions``\` -----------------------------------------------------

You can configure different naming conventions by setting the `python_files`, `python_classes` and `python_functions` in your \[configuration file \<config file formats\>\](\#configuration-file-\<config-file-formats\>). Here is an example:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     # Example 1: have pytest look for "check" instead of "test"     [pytest]     python_files = check_*.py     python_classes = Check     python_functions = *_check  This would make ``pytest`look for tests in files that match the`[check]()\* `` ` .py `` glob-pattern, `Check` prefixes in classes, and functions and methods that match `*_check`. For example, if we have:

`` `python     # content of check_myapp.py     class CheckMyApp:         def simple_check(self):             pass          def complex_check(self):             pass  The test collection would look like this:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest --collect-only     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     configfile: pytest.ini     collected 2 items      <Dir pythoncollection.rst-205>       <Module check_myapp.py>         <Class CheckMyApp>           <Function simple_check>           <Function complex_check>      ======================== 2 tests collected in 0.12s ========================  You can check for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between the patterns:  .. code-block:: ini      # Example 2: have pytest look for files with "test" and "example"     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     python_files = test_*.py example_*.py  > **Note** >     the ``python\_functions`and`python\_classes`options has no effect    for`unittest.TestCase`test discovery because pytest delegates    discovery of test case methods to unittest code.  Interpreting cmdline arguments as Python packages`\` -----------------------------------------------------

You can use the `--pyargs` option to make `pytest` try interpreting arguments as python package names, deriving their file system path and then running the test. For example if you have unittest2 installed you can type:

`` `bash     pytest --pyargs unittest2.test.test_skipping -q  which would run the respective test module.  Like with ``<span class="title-ref"> other options, through an ini-file and the :confval:\`addopts</span> option you can make this change more permanently:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     addopts = --pyargs  Now a simple invocation of ``pytest NAME`will check`\` if NAME exists as an importable package/module and otherwise treat it as a filesystem path.

## Finding out what is collected

You can always peek at the collection tree without running tests like this:

`` `pytest     . $ pytest --collect-only pythoncollection.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     configfile: pytest.ini     collected 3 items      <Dir pythoncollection.rst-205>       <Dir CWD>         <Module pythoncollection.py>           <Function test_function>           <Class TestClass>             <Function test_method>             <Function test_anothermethod>      ======================== 3 tests collected in 0.12s ========================  .. _customizing-test-collection:  Customizing test collection ``\` ---------------------------

You can easily instruct `pytest` to discover tests from every Python file:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     python_files = *.py  However, many projects will have a ``setup.py`which they don't want to be`<span class="title-ref"> imported. Moreover, there may files only importable by a specific python version. For such cases you can dynamically define files to be ignored by listing them in a </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\` file:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import sys      collect_ignore = ["setup.py"]     if sys.version_info[0] > 2:         collect_ignore.append("pkg/module_py2.py")  and then if you have a module file like this:  .. code-block:: python      # content of pkg/module_py2.py     def test_only_on_python2():         try:             assert 0         except Exception, e:             pass  and a ``setup.py`dummy file like this:  .. code-block:: python      # content of setup.py     0 / 0  # will raise exception if imported  If you run with a Python 2 interpreter then you will find the one test and will`<span class="title-ref"> leave out the </span><span class="title-ref">setup.py</span>\` file:

The following example `conftest.py` ignores the file `setup.py` and in addition all files that end with `*_py2.py` when executed with a Python 3 interpreter:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import sys      collect_ignore = ["setup.py"]     if sys.version_info[0] > 2:         collect_ignore_glob = ["*_py2.py"]  Since Pytest 2.6, users can prevent pytest from discovering classes that start ``<span class="title-ref"> with </span><span class="title-ref">Test</span><span class="title-ref"> by setting a boolean </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_test\_\_</span><span class="title-ref"> attribute to </span><span class="title-ref">False</span>\`.

# Basic patterns and examples

## How to change command line options defaults

It can be tedious to type the same series of command line options every time you use `pytest`. For example, if you always want to see detailed info on skipped and xfailed tests, as well as have terser "dot" progress output, you can write it into a configuration file:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     addopts = -ra -q   Alternatively, you can set a ``PYTEST\_ADDOPTS`environment variable to add command`\` line options while the environment is in use:

`` `bash     export PYTEST_ADDOPTS="-v"  Here's how the command-line is built in the presence of ``addopts`or the environment variable:  .. code-block:: text      <pytest.ini:addopts> $PYTEST_ADDOPTS <extra command-line arguments>  So if the user executes in the command-line:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest -m slow  The actual command line executed is:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest -ra -q -v -m slow  Note that as usual for other command-line applications, in case of conflicting options the last one wins, so the example`<span class="title-ref"> above will show verbose output because </span><span class="title-ref">-v</span><span class="title-ref"> overwrites </span><span class="title-ref">-q</span>\`.

## Pass different values to a test function, depending on command line options

Suppose we want to write a test that depends on a command line option. Here is a basic pattern to achieve this:

`` `python     # content of test_sample.py     def test_answer(cmdopt):         if cmdopt == "type1":             print("first")         elif cmdopt == "type2":             print("second")         assert 0  # to see what was printed   For this to work we need to add a command line option and ``<span class="title-ref"> provide the </span><span class="title-ref">cmdopt</span>\` through a \[fixture function \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-function-\<fixture\>):

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import pytest       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "--cmdopt", action="store", default="type1", help="my option: type1 or type2"         )       @pytest.fixture     def cmdopt(request):         return request.config.getoption("--cmdopt")  Let's run this without supplying our new option:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q test_sample.py     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________      cmdopt = 'type1'          def test_answer(cmdopt):             if cmdopt == "type1":                 print("first")             elif cmdopt == "type2":                 print("second")     >       assert 0  # to see what was printed     E       assert 0      test_sample.py:6: AssertionError     --------------------------- Captured stdout call ---------------------------     first     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 0     1 failed in 0.12s  And now with supplying a command line option:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q --cmdopt=type2     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________      cmdopt = 'type2'          def test_answer(cmdopt):             if cmdopt == "type1":                 print("first")             elif cmdopt == "type2":                 print("second")     >       assert 0  # to see what was printed     E       assert 0      test_sample.py:6: AssertionError     --------------------------- Captured stdout call ---------------------------     second     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 0     1 failed in 0.12s  You can see that the command line option arrived in our test.  We could add simple validation for the input by listing the choices:  .. code-block:: python      # content of conftest.py     import pytest       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "--cmdopt",             action="store",             default="type1",             help="my option: type1 or type2",             choices=("type1", "type2"),         )  Now we'll get feedback on a bad argument:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q --cmdopt=type3     ERROR: usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]     pytest: error: argument --cmdopt: invalid choice: 'type3' (choose from 'type1', 'type2')   If you need to provide more detailed error messages, you can use the ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">type</span>\` parameter and raise \`pytest.UsageError\`:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import pytest       def type_checker(value):         msg = "cmdopt must specify a numeric type as typeNNN"         if not value.startswith("type"):             raise pytest.UsageError(msg)         try:             int(value[4:])         except ValueError:             raise pytest.UsageError(msg)          return value       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "--cmdopt",             action="store",             default="type1",             help="my option: type1 or type2",             type=type_checker,         )  This completes the basic pattern.  However, one often rather wants to ``\` process command line options outside of the test and rather pass in different or more complex objects.

## Dynamically adding command line options

Through `addopts` you can statically add command line options for your project. You can also dynamically modify the command line arguments before they get processed:

`` `python     # installable external plugin     import sys       def pytest_load_initial_conftests(args):         if "xdist" in sys.modules:  # pytest-xdist plugin             import multiprocessing              num = max(multiprocessing.cpu_count() / 2, 1)             args[:] = ["-n", str(num)] + args  If you have the :pypi:`xdist plugin <pytest-xdist>` installed ``\` you will now always perform test runs using a number of subprocesses close to your CPU. Running in an empty directory with the above conftest.py:

`` `pytest     $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 0 items      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================  .. _`excontrolskip`:  Control skipping of tests according to command line option ``\` --------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a `conftest.py` file adding a `--runslow` command line option to control skipping of `pytest.mark.slow` marked tests:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import pytest       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "--runslow", action="store_true", default=False, help="run slow tests"         )       def pytest_configure(config):         config.addinivalue_line("markers", "slow: mark test as slow to run")       def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):         if config.getoption("--runslow"):             # --runslow given in cli: do not skip slow tests             return         skip_slow = pytest.mark.skip(reason="need --runslow option to run")         for item in items:             if "slow" in item.keywords:                 item.add_marker(skip_slow)  We can now write a test module like this:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_module.py     import pytest       def test_func_fast():         pass       @pytest.mark.slow     def test_func_slow():         pass  and when running it will see a skipped "slow" test:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -rs    # "-rs" means report details on the little 's'     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py .s                                                    [100%]      ========================= short test summary info ==========================     SKIPPED [1] test_module.py:8: need --runslow option to run     ======================= 1 passed, 1 skipped in 0.12s =======================  Or run it including the ``slow``marked test:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest --runslow     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py ..                                                    [100%]      ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================  .. _`__tracebackhide__`:  Writing well integrated assertion helpers``\` -----------------------------------------

If you have a test helper function called from a test you can use the `pytest.fail` marker to fail a test with a certain message. The test support function will not show up in the traceback if you set the `__tracebackhide__` option somewhere in the helper function. Example:

`` `python     # content of test_checkconfig.py     import pytest       def checkconfig(x):         __tracebackhide__ = True         if not hasattr(x, "config"):             pytest.fail(f"not configured: {x}")       def test_something():         checkconfig(42)  The ``\_\_[tracebackhide](#__tracebackhide__)`setting influences`pytest`showing`<span class="title-ref"> of tracebacks: the </span><span class="title-ref">checkconfig</span><span class="title-ref"> function will not be shown unless the </span><span class="title-ref">--full-trace</span>\` command line option is specified. Let's run our little function:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q test_checkconfig.py     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ test_something ______________________________          def test_something():     >       checkconfig(42)     E       Failed: not configured: 42      test_checkconfig.py:11: Failed     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_checkconfig.py::test_something - Failed: not configured: 42     1 failed in 0.12s  If you only want to hide certain exceptions, you can set ``\_\_tracebackhide\_\_`  `<span class="title-ref"> to a callable which gets the </span><span class="title-ref">ExceptionInfo</span>\` object. You can for example use this to make sure unexpected exception types aren't hidden:

`` `python     import operator      import pytest       class ConfigException(Exception):         pass       def checkconfig(x):         __tracebackhide__ = operator.methodcaller("errisinstance", ConfigException)         if not hasattr(x, "config"):             raise ConfigException(f"not configured: {x}")       def test_something():         checkconfig(42)  This will avoid hiding the exception traceback on unrelated exceptions (i.e. ``\` bugs in assertion helpers).

## Detect if running from within a pytest run

Usually it is a bad idea to make application code behave differently if called from a test. But if you absolutely must find out if your application code is running from a test you can do this:

`` `python     import os       if os.environ.get("PYTEST_VERSION") is not None:         # Things you want to to do if your code is called by pytest.         ...     else:         # Things you want to to do if your code is not called by pytest.         ...   Adding info to test report header ``\` --------------------------------------------------------------

It's easy to present extra information in a `pytest` run:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py       def pytest_report_header(config):         return "project deps: mylib-1.1"  which will add the string to the test header accordingly:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     project deps: mylib-1.1     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 0 items      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================  .. regendoc:wipe  It is also possible to return a list of strings which will be considered as several ``<span class="title-ref"> lines of information. You may consider </span><span class="title-ref">config.getoption('verbose')</span>\` in order to display more information if applicable:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py       def pytest_report_header(config):         if config.get_verbosity() > 0:             return ["info1: did you know that ...", "did you?"]  which will add info only when run with "--v":  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     info1: did you know that ...     did you?     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 0 items      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================  and nothing when run plainly:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 0 items      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================  Profiling test duration ``\` --------------------------

If you have a slow running large test suite you might want to find out which tests are the slowest. Let's make an artificial test suite:

`` `python     # content of test_some_are_slow.py     import time       def test_funcfast():         time.sleep(0.1)       def test_funcslow1():         time.sleep(0.2)       def test_funcslow2():         time.sleep(0.3)  Now we can profile which test functions execute the slowest:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest --durations=3     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 3 items      test_some_are_slow.py ...                                            [100%]      =========================== slowest 3 durations ============================     0.30s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcslow2     0.20s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcslow1     0.10s call     test_some_are_slow.py::test_funcfast     ============================ 3 passed in 0.12s =============================  Incremental testing - test steps ``\` ---------------------------------------------------

Sometimes you may have a testing situation which consists of a series of test steps. If one step fails it makes no sense to execute further steps as they are all expected to fail anyway and their tracebacks add no insight. Here is a simple `conftest.py` file which introduces an `incremental` marker which is to be used on classes:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      from typing import Dict, Tuple      import pytest      # store history of failures per test class name and per index in parametrize (if parametrize used)     _test_failed_incremental: Dict[str, Dict[Tuple[int, ...], str]] = {}       def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):         if "incremental" in item.keywords:             # incremental marker is used             if call.excinfo is not None:                 # the test has failed                 # retrieve the class name of the test                 cls_name = str(item.cls)                 # retrieve the index of the test (if parametrize is used in combination with incremental)                 parametrize_index = (                     tuple(item.callspec.indices.values())                     if hasattr(item, "callspec")                     else ()                 )                 # retrieve the name of the test function                 test_name = item.originalname or item.name                 # store in _test_failed_incremental the original name of the failed test                 _test_failed_incremental.setdefault(cls_name, {}).setdefault(                     parametrize_index, test_name                 )       def pytest_runtest_setup(item):         if "incremental" in item.keywords:             # retrieve the class name of the test             cls_name = str(item.cls)             # check if a previous test has failed for this class             if cls_name in _test_failed_incremental:                 # retrieve the index of the test (if parametrize is used in combination with incremental)                 parametrize_index = (                     tuple(item.callspec.indices.values())                     if hasattr(item, "callspec")                     else ()                 )                 # retrieve the name of the first test function to fail for this class name and index                 test_name = _test_failed_incremental[cls_name].get(parametrize_index, None)                 # if name found, test has failed for the combination of class name & test name                 if test_name is not None:                     pytest.xfail(f"previous test failed ({test_name})")   These two hook implementations work together to abort incremental-marked ``\` tests in a class. Here is a test module example:

`` `python     # content of test_step.py      import pytest       @pytest.mark.incremental     class TestUserHandling:         def test_login(self):             pass          def test_modification(self):             assert 0          def test_deletion(self):             pass       def test_normal():         pass  If we run this:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -rx     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 4 items      test_step.py .Fx.

It is reported as an "expected failure".

## Package/Directory-level fixtures (setups)

If you have nested test directories, you can have per-directory fixture scopes by placing fixture functions in a `conftest.py` file in that directory. You can use all types of fixtures including \[autouse fixtures \<autouse fixtures\>\](\#autouse-fixtures \<autouse-fixtures\>) which are the equivalent of xUnit's setup/teardown concept. It's however recommended to have explicit fixture references in your tests or test classes rather than relying on implicitly executing setup/teardown functions, especially if they are far away from the actual tests.

Here is an example for making a `db` fixture available in a directory:

`` `python     # content of a/conftest.py     import pytest       class DB:         pass       @pytest.fixture(scope="package")     def db():         return DB()  and then a test module in that directory:  .. code-block:: python      # content of a/test_db.py     def test_a1(db):         assert 0, db  # to show value  another test module:  .. code-block:: python      # content of a/test_db2.py     def test_a2(db):         assert 0, db  # to show value  and then a module in a sister directory which will not see ``<span class="title-ref"> the </span><span class="title-ref">db</span>\` fixture:

`` `python     # content of b/test_error.py     def test_root(db):  # no db here, will error out         pass  We can run this:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 7 items      a/test_db.py F                                                       [ 14%]     a/test_db2.py F                                                      [ 28%]     b/test_error.py E                                                    [ 42%]     test_step.py .Fx.

Note that each fixture is only instantiated if there is a test actually needing it (unless you use "autouse" fixture which are always executed ahead of the first test executing).

## Post-process test reports / failures

If you want to postprocess test reports and need access to the executing environment you can implement a hook that gets called when the test "report" object is about to be created. Here we write out all failing test calls and also access a fixture (if it was used by the test) in case you want to query/look at it during your post processing. In our case we just write some information out to a `failures` file:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import os.path      import pytest       @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True, tryfirst=True)     def pytest_runtest_makereport(item, call):         # execute all other hooks to obtain the report object         rep = yield          # we only look at actual failing test calls, not setup/teardown         if rep.when == "call" and rep.failed:             mode = "a" if os.path.exists("failures") else "w"             with open("failures", mode, encoding="utf-8") as f:                 # let's also access a fixture for the fun of it                 if "tmp_path" in item.fixturenames:                     extra = " ({})".format(item.funcargs["tmp_path"])                 else:                     extra = ""                  f.write(rep.nodeid + extra + "\n")          return rep   if you then have failing tests:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_module.py     def test_fail1(tmp_path):         assert 0       def test_fail2():         assert 0  and run them:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_module.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py FF                                                    [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ________________________________ test_fail1 ________________________________      tmp_path = PosixPath('PYTEST_TMPDIR/test_fail10')          def test_fail1(tmp_path):     >       assert 0     E       assert 0      test_module.py:2: AssertionError     ________________________________ test_fail2 ________________________________          def test_fail2():     >       assert 0     E       assert 0      test_module.py:6: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_module.py::test_fail1 - assert 0     FAILED test_module.py::test_fail2 - assert 0     ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================  you will have a "failures" file which contains the failing test ids:  .. code-block:: bash      $ cat failures     test_module.py::test_fail1 (PYTEST_TMPDIR/test_fail10)     test_module.py::test_fail2  Making test result information available in fixtures ``\` -----------------------------------------------------------

If you want to make test result reports available in fixture finalizers here is a little example implemented via a local plugin:

## `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` environment variable

Sometimes a test session might get stuck and there might be no easy way to figure out which test got stuck, for example if pytest was run in quiet mode (`-q`) or you don't have access to the console output. This is particularly a problem if the problem happens only sporadically, the famous "flaky" kind of tests.

`pytest` sets the `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` environment variable when running tests, which can be inspected by process monitoring utilities or libraries like `psutil` to discover which test got stuck if necessary:

`` `python     import psutil      for pid in psutil.pids():         environ = psutil.Process(pid).environ()         if "PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST" in environ:             print(f'pytest process {pid} running: {environ["PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST"]}')  During the test session pytest will set ``PYTEST\_CURRENT\_TEST`to the current test`<span class="title-ref"> \[nodeid \<nodeids\>\](\#nodeid-\<nodeids\>) and the current stage, which can be </span><span class="title-ref">setup</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">call</span><span class="title-ref">, or </span><span class="title-ref">teardown</span>\`.

For example, when running a single test function named `test_foo` from `foo_module.py`, `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` will be set to:

1.  `foo_module.py::test_foo (setup)`
2.  `foo_module.py::test_foo (call)`
3.  `foo_module.py::test_foo (teardown)`

In that order.

\> **Note** \> The contents of `PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` is meant to be human readable and the actual format can be changed between releases (even bug fixes) so it shouldn't be relied on for scripting or automation.

## Freezing pytest

If you freeze your application using a tool like [PyInstaller](https://pyinstaller.readthedocs.io) in order to distribute it to your end-users, it is a good idea to also package your test runner and run your tests using the frozen application. This way packaging errors such as dependencies not being included into the executable can be detected early while also allowing you to send test files to users so they can run them in their machines, which can be useful to obtain more information about a hard to reproduce bug.

Fortunately recent `PyInstaller` releases already have a custom hook for pytest, but if you are using another tool to freeze executables such as `cx_freeze` or `py2exe`, you can use `pytest.freeze_includes()` to obtain the full list of internal pytest modules. How to configure the tools to find the internal modules varies from tool to tool, however.

Instead of freezing the pytest runner as a separate executable, you can make your frozen program work as the pytest runner by some clever argument handling during program startup. This allows you to have a single executable, which is usually more convenient. Please note that the mechanism for plugin discovery used by pytest (\[entry points \<pip-installable plugins\>\](\#entry points-\<pip-installable-plugins\>)) doesn't work with frozen executables so pytest can't find any third party plugins automatically. To include third party plugins like `pytest-timeout` they must be imported explicitly and passed on to pytest.main.

`` `python     # contents of app_main.py     import sys      import pytest_timeout  # Third party plugin      if len(sys.argv) > 1 and sys.argv[1] == "--pytest":         import pytest          sys.exit(pytest.main(sys.argv[2:], plugins=[pytest_timeout]))     else:         # normal application execution: at this point argv can be parsed         # by your argument-parsing library of choice as usual         ...   This allows you to execute tests using the frozen ``<span class="title-ref"> application with standard </span><span class="title-ref">pytest</span>\` command-line options:

`` `bash ./app_main --pytest --verbose --tb=long --junit=xml=results.xml test-suite/ ``\`

# A session-fixture which can look at all collected tests

A session-scoped fixture effectively has access to all collected test items. Here is an example of a fixture function which walks all collected tests and looks if their test class defines a `callme` method and calls it:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="session", autouse=True)     def callattr_ahead_of_alltests(request):         print("callattr_ahead_of_alltests called")         seen = {None}         session = request.node         for item in session.items:             cls = item.getparent(pytest.Class)             if cls not in seen:                 if hasattr(cls.obj, "callme"):                     cls.obj.callme()                 seen.add(cls)  test classes may now define a ``callme`method which`\` will be called ahead of running any tests:

`` `python     # content of test_module.py       class TestHello:         @classmethod         def callme(cls):             print("callme called!")          def test_method1(self):             print("test_method1 called")          def test_method2(self):             print("test_method2 called")       class TestOther:         @classmethod         def callme(cls):             print("callme other called")          def test_other(self):             print("test other")       # works with unittest as well ...     import unittest       class SomeTest(unittest.TestCase):         @classmethod         def callme(self):             print("SomeTest callme called")          def test_unit1(self):             print("test_unit1 method called")  If you run this without output capturing:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q -s test_module.py     callattr_ahead_of_alltests called     callme called!     callme other called     SomeTest callme called     test_method1 called     .test_method2 called     .test other     .test_unit1 method called     .     4 passed in 0.12s ``\`

# Anatomy of a test

In the simplest terms, a test is meant to look at the result of a particular behavior, and make sure that result aligns with what you would expect. Behavior is not something that can be empirically measured, which is why writing tests can be challenging.

"Behavior" is the way in which some system **acts in response** to a particular situation and/or stimuli. But exactly *how* or *why* something is done is not quite as important as *what* was done.

You can think of a test as being broken down into four steps:

1.  **Arrange**
2.  **Act**
3.  **Assert**
4.  **Cleanup**

**Arrange** is where we prepare everything for our test. This means pretty much everything except for the "**act**". It's lining up the dominoes so that the **act** can do its thing in one, state-changing step. This can mean preparing objects, starting/killing services, entering records into a database, or even things like defining a URL to query, generating some credentials for a user that doesn't exist yet, or just waiting for some process to finish.

**Act** is the singular, state-changing action that kicks off the **behavior** we want to test. This behavior is what carries out the changing of the state of the system under test (SUT), and it's the resulting changed state that we can look at to make a judgement about the behavior. This typically takes the form of a function/method call.

**Assert** is where we look at that resulting state and check if it looks how we'd expect after the dust has settled. It's where we gather evidence to say the behavior does or does not align with what we expect. The `assert` in our test is where we take that measurement/observation and apply our judgement to it. If something should be green, we'd say `assert thing == "green"`.

**Cleanup** is where the test picks up after itself, so other tests aren't being accidentally influenced by it.

At its core, the test is ultimately the **act** and **assert** steps, with the **arrange** step only providing the context. **Behavior** exists between **act** and **assert**.

# CI Pipelines

## Rationale

The goal of testing in a CI pipeline is different from testing locally. Indeed, you can quickly edit some code and run your tests again on your computer, but it is not possible with CI pipeline. They run on a separate server and are triggered by specific actions.

From that observation, pytest can detect when it is in a CI environment and adapt some of its behaviours.

## How CI is detected

Pytest knows it is in a CI environment when either one of these environment variables are set, regardless of their value:

  - \`CI\`: used by many CI systems.
  - \`BUILD\_NUMBER\`: used by Jenkins.

## Effects on CI

For now, the effects on pytest of being in a CI environment are limited.

When a CI environment is detected, the output of the short test summary info is no longer truncated to the terminal size i.e. the entire message will be shown.

pytest fixtures are designed to be explicit, modular and scalable.

## What fixtures are

In testing, a [fixture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture#Software) provides a defined, reliable and consistent context for the tests. This could include environment (for example a database configured with known parameters) or content (such as a dataset).

Fixtures define the steps and data that constitute the *arrange* phase of a test (see \[test-anatomy\](\#test-anatomy)). In pytest, they are functions you define that serve this purpose. They can also be used to define a test's *act* phase; this is a powerful technique for designing more complex tests.

The services, state, or other operating environments set up by fixtures are accessed by test functions through arguments. For each fixture used by a test function there is typically a parameter (named after the fixture) in the test function's definition.

We can tell pytest that a particular function is a fixture by decorating it with :py\`@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture\>\`. Here's a simple example of what a fixture in pytest might look like:

`` `python     import pytest       class Fruit:         def __init__(self, name):             self.name = name          def __eq__(self, other):             return self.name == other.name       @pytest.fixture     def my_fruit():         return Fruit("apple")       @pytest.fixture     def fruit_basket(my_fruit):         return [Fruit("banana"), my_fruit]       def test_my_fruit_in_basket(my_fruit, fruit_basket):         assert my_fruit in fruit_basket  Tests don't have to be limited to a single fixture, either. They can depend on ``\` as many fixtures as you want, and fixtures can use other fixtures, as well. This is where pytest's fixture system really shines.

## Improvements over xUnit-style setup/teardown functions

pytest fixtures offer dramatic improvements over the classic xUnit style of setup/teardown functions:

  - fixtures have explicit names and are activated by declaring their use from test functions, modules, classes or whole projects.
  - fixtures are implemented in a modular manner, as each fixture name triggers a *fixture function* which can itself use other fixtures.
  - fixture management scales from simple unit to complex functional testing, allowing to parametrize fixtures and tests according to configuration and component options, or to reuse fixtures across function, class, module or whole test session scopes.
  - teardown logic can be easily, and safely managed, no matter how many fixtures are used, without the need to carefully handle errors by hand or micromanage the order that cleanup steps are added.

In addition, pytest continues to support \[xunitsetup\](\#xunitsetup). You can mix both styles, moving incrementally from classic to new style, as you prefer. You can also start out from existing \[unittest.TestCase style \<unittest.TestCase\>\](\#unittest.testcase style-\<unittest.testcase\>).

## Fixture errors

pytest does its best to put all the fixtures for a given test in a linear order so that it can see which fixture happens first, second, third, and so on. If an earlier fixture has a problem, though, and raises an exception, pytest will stop executing fixtures for that test and mark the test as having an error.

When a test is marked as having an error, it doesn't mean the test failed, though. It just means the test couldn't even be attempted because one of the things it depends on had a problem.

This is one reason why it's a good idea to cut out as many unnecessary dependencies as possible for a given test. That way a problem in something unrelated isn't causing us to have an incomplete picture of what may or may not have issues.

Here's a quick example to help explain:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def order():         return []       @pytest.fixture     def append_first(order):         order.append(1)       @pytest.fixture     def append_second(order, append_first):         order.extend([2])       @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)     def append_third(order, append_second):         order += [3]       def test_order(order):         assert order == [1, 2, 3]   If, for whatever reason, ``order.append(1)`had a bug and it raises an exception,`<span class="title-ref"> we wouldn't be able to know if </span><span class="title-ref">order.extend(\[2\])</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">order += \[3\]</span><span class="title-ref"> would also have problems. After </span><span class="title-ref">append\_first</span><span class="title-ref"> throws an exception, pytest won't run any more fixtures for </span><span class="title-ref">test\_order</span><span class="title-ref">, and it won't even try to run </span><span class="title-ref">test\_order</span><span class="title-ref"> itself. The only things that would've run would be </span><span class="title-ref">order</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">append\_first</span>\`.

## Sharing test data

If you want to make test data from files available to your tests, a good way to do this is by loading these data in a fixture for use by your tests. This makes use of the automatic caching mechanisms of pytest.

Another good approach is by adding the data files in the `tests` folder. There are also community plugins available to help to manage this aspect of testing, e.g. `pytest-datadir` and `pytest-datafiles`.

## A note about fixture cleanup

pytest does not do any special processing for <span class="title-ref">SIGTERM \<signal.SIGTERM\></span> and `SIGQUIT` signals (<span class="title-ref">SIGINT \<signal.SIGINT\></span> is handled naturally by the Python runtime via <span class="title-ref">KeyboardInterrupt</span>), so fixtures that manage external resources which are important to be cleared when the Python process is terminated (by those signals) might leak resources.

The reason pytest does not handle those signals to perform fixture cleanup is that signal handlers are global, and changing them might interfere with the code under execution.

If fixtures in your suite need special care regarding termination in those scenarios, see `this comment <5243#issuecomment-491522595>` in the issue tracker for a possible workaround.

# Flaky tests

A "flaky" test is one that exhibits intermittent or sporadic failure, that seems to have non-deterministic behaviour. Sometimes it passes, sometimes it fails, and it's not clear why. This page discusses pytest features that can help and other general strategies for identifying, fixing or mitigating them.

## Why flaky tests are a problem

Flaky tests are particularly troublesome when a continuous integration (CI) server is being used, so that all tests must pass before a new code change can be merged. If the test result is not a reliable signal -- that a test failure means the code change broke the test -- developers can become mistrustful of the test results, which can lead to overlooking genuine failures. It is also a source of wasted time as developers must re-run test suites and investigate spurious failures.

## Potential root causes

### System state

Broadly speaking, a flaky test indicates that the test relies on some system state that is not being appropriately controlled - the test environment is not sufficiently isolated. Higher level tests are more likely to be flaky as they rely on more state.

Flaky tests sometimes appear when a test suite is run in parallel (such as use of [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist)). This can indicate a test is reliant on test ordering.

  - Perhaps a different test is failing to clean up after itself and leaving behind data which causes the flaky test to fail.
  - The flaky test is reliant on data from a previous test that doesn't clean up after itself, and in parallel runs that previous test is not always present
  - Tests that modify global state typically cannot be run in parallel.

### Overly strict assertion

Overly strict assertions can cause problems with floating point comparison as well as timing issues. <span class="title-ref">pytest.approx</span> is useful here.

### Thread safety

pytest is single-threaded, executing its tests always in the same thread, sequentially, never spawning any threads itself.

Even in case of plugins which run tests in parallel, for example [pytest-xdist](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist), usually work by spawning multiple *processes* and running tests in batches, without using multiple threads.

It is of course possible (and common) for tests and fixtures to spawn threads themselves as part of their testing workflow (for example, a fixture that starts a server thread in the background, or a test which executes production code that spawns threads), but some care must be taken:

  - Make sure to eventually wait on any spawned threads -- for example at the end of a test, or during the teardown of a fixture.
  - Avoid using primitives provided by pytest (<span class="title-ref">pytest.warns</span>, <span class="title-ref">pytest.raises</span>, etc) from multiple threads, as they are not thread-safe.

If your test suite uses threads and your are seeing flaky test results, do not discount the possibility that the test is implicitly using global state in pytest itself.

## Related features

### Xfail strict

\[pytest.mark.xfail ref\](\#pytest.mark.xfail-ref) with `strict=False` can be used to mark a test so that its failure does not cause the whole build to break. This could be considered like a manual quarantine, and is rather dangerous to use permanently.

### PYTEST\_CURRENT\_TEST

`PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST` may be useful for figuring out "which test got stuck". See \[pytest current test env\](\#pytest-current-test-env) for more details.

### Plugins

Rerunning any failed tests can mitigate the negative effects of flaky tests by giving them additional chances to pass, so that the overall build does not fail. Several pytest plugins support this:

  - [pytest-rerunfailures](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-rerunfailures)
  - [pytest-replay](https://github.com/ESSS/pytest-replay): This plugin helps to reproduce locally crashes or flaky tests observed during CI runs.
  - [pytest-flakefinder](https://github.com/dropbox/pytest-flakefinder) - [blog post](https://blogs.dropbox.com/tech/2016/03/open-sourcing-pytest-tools/)

Plugins to deliberately randomize tests can help expose tests with state problems:

  - [pytest-random-order](https://github.com/jbasko/pytest-random-order)
  - [pytest-randomly](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-randomly)

## Other general strategies

### Split up test suites

It can be common to split a single test suite into two, such as unit vs integration, and only use the unit test suite as a CI gate. This also helps keep build times manageable as high level tests tend to be slower. However, it means it does become possible for code that breaks the build to be merged, so extra vigilance is needed for monitoring the integration test results.

### Video/screenshot on failure

For UI tests these are important for understanding what the state of the UI was when the test failed. pytest-splinter can be used with plugins like pytest-bdd and can [save a screenshot on test failure](https://pytest-splinter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#automatic-screenshots-on-test-failure), which can help to isolate the cause.

### Delete or rewrite the test

If the functionality is covered by other tests, perhaps the test can be removed. If not, perhaps it can be rewritten at a lower level which will remove the flakiness or make its source more apparent.

### Quarantine

Mark Lapierre discusses the [Pros and Cons of Quarantined Tests](https://dev.to/mlapierre/pros-and-cons-of-quarantined-tests-2emj) in a post from 2018.

### CI tools that rerun on failure

Azure Pipelines (the Azure cloud CI/CD tool, formerly Visual Studio Team Services or VSTS) has a feature to [identify flaky tests](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/azure/devops/2017/dec-11-vsts?view=tfs-2017#identify-flaky-tests) and rerun failed tests.

# Good Integration Practices

## Install package with pip

For development, we recommend you use `venv` for virtual environments and \[pip:index\](pip:index.md) for installing your application and any dependencies, as well as the `pytest` package itself. This ensures your code and dependencies are isolated from your system Python installation.

Create a `pyproject.toml` file in the root of your repository as described in \[packaging:tutorials/packaging-projects\](packaging:tutorials/packaging-projects.md). The first few lines should look like this:

  - `` `toml     [build-system]     requires = ["hatchling"]     build-backend = "hatchling.build"      [project]     name = "PACKAGENAME"     version = "PACKAGEVERSION"  where ``PACKAGENAME`and`PACKAGEVERSION``are the name and version of your package respectively.  You can then install your package in "editable" mode by running from the same directory:  .. code-block:: bash      pip install -e .  which lets you change your source code (both tests and application) and rerun tests at will.    .. _`Python test discovery`:  Conventions for Python test discovery -------------------------------------------------``pytest``implements the following standard test discovery:  * If no arguments are specified then collection starts from :confval:`testpaths`   (if configured) or the current directory. Alternatively, command line arguments   can be used in any combination of directories, file names or node ids. * Recurse into directories, unless they match :confval:`norecursedirs`. * In those directories, search for``[test]()*.py\`\` or \`\`*\_test.py``files, imported by their `test package name`_. * From those files, collect test items:    *``test`prefixed test functions or methods outside of class.   *`test`prefixed test functions or methods inside`Test`prefixed test classes (without an`\_\_init\_\_`method). Methods decorated with`@staticmethod`and`@classmethods`are also considered.  For examples of how to customize your test discovery [/example/pythoncollection](/example/pythoncollection.md).  Within Python modules,`pytest``also discovers tests using the standard [unittest.TestCase <unittest.TestCase>](#unittest.testcase-<unittest.testcase>) subclassing technique.   .. _`test layout`:  Choosing a test layout ----------------------``pytest`supports two common test layouts:  Tests outside application code ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Putting tests into an extra directory outside your actual application code might be useful if you have many functional tests or for other reasons want to keep tests separate from actual application code (often a good idea):`\`text  
    pyproject.toml src/ mypkg/ \_\_init\_\_.py app.py view.py tests/ test\_app.py test\_view.py ...

This has the following benefits:

\* Your tests can run against an installed version after executing `pip install .`. `` ` * Your tests can run against the local copy with an editable install after executing ``pip install --editable .`.  For new projects, we recommend to use`importlib`[import mode <import-modes>](#import-mode-<import-modes>) (see which-import-mode_ for a detailed explanation). To this end, add the following to your`pyproject.toml`:`\`toml \[tool.pytest.ini\_options\] addopts = \[ "--import-mode=importlib", \]

<div id="src-layout">

Generally, but especially if you use the default import mode `prepend`, `` ` it is **strongly** suggested to use a ``src`layout. Here, your application root package resides in a sub-directory of your root, i.e.`src/mypkg/`instead of`mypkg``.  This layout prevents a lot of common pitfalls and has many benefits, which are better explained in this excellent `blog post`_ by Ionel Cristian Mărieș.    > **Note** >      If you do not use an editable install and use the``src`layout as above you need to extend the Python's     search path for module files to execute the tests against the local copy directly. You can do it in an     ad-hoc manner by setting the`PYTHONPATH`environment variable:`\`bash PYTHONPATH=src pytest

</div>

> or in a permanent manner by using the `pythonpath` configuration variable and adding the following to your `pyproject.toml`:
> 
> ``` toml
> [tool.pytest.ini_options]
> pythonpath = "src"
> ```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If you do not use an editable install and not use the `src` layout (`mypkg` directly in the root directory) you can rely on the fact that Python by default puts the current directory in `sys.path` to import your package and run `python -m pytest` to execute the tests against the local copy directly.

See \[pytest vs python -m pytest\](\#pytest-vs-python--m-pytest) for more information about the difference between calling `pytest` and `python -m pytest`.

</div>

Tests as part of application code `` ` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  Inlining test directories into your application package is useful if you have direct relation between tests and application modules and want to distribute them along with your application: ``\`text pyproject.toml \[src/\]mypkg/ \_\_init\_\_.py app.py view.py tests/ \_\_init\_\_.py test\_app.py test\_view.py ...

In this scheme, it is easy to run your tests using the `--pyargs` option:

``` bash
pytest --pyargs mypkg
```

`pytest` will discover where `mypkg` is installed and collect tests from there.

Note that this layout also works in conjunction with the `src` layout mentioned in the previous section.

\> **Note** \> You can use namespace packages (PEP420) for your application but pytest will still perform [test package name](#test%20package%20name) discovery based on the presence of `__init__.py` files. If you use one of the two recommended file system layouts above but leave away the `__init__.py` files from your directories, it should just work. From "inlined tests", however, you will need to use absolute imports for getting at your application code.

<div id="test package name">

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

In `prepend` and `append` import-modes, if pytest finds a `"a/b/test_module.py"` test file while recursing into the filesystem it determines the import name as follows:

  - determine `basedir`: this is the first "upward" (towards the root) directory not containing an `__init__.py`. If e.g. both `a` and `b` contain an `__init__.py` file then the parent directory of `a` will become the `basedir`.
  - perform `sys.path.insert(0, basedir)` to make the test module importable under the fully qualified import name.
  - `import a.b.test_module` where the path is determined by converting path separators `/` into "." characters. This means you must follow the convention of having directory and file names map directly to the import names.

The reason for this somewhat evolved importing technique is that in larger projects multiple test modules might import from each other and thus deriving a canonical import name helps to avoid surprises such as a test module getting imported twice.

With `--import-mode=importlib` things are less convoluted because pytest doesn't need to change `sys.path` or `sys.modules`, making things much less surprising.

</div>

</div>

<div id="which-import-mode">

Choosing an import mode `` ` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^  For historical reasons, pytest defaults to the ``prepend`[import mode <import-modes>](#import-mode-<import-modes>) instead of the`importlib`import mode we recommend for new projects. The reason lies in the way the`prepend`mode works:  Since there are no packages to derive a full package name from,`pytest`will import your test files as *top-level* modules. The test files in the first example ([src layout <src-layout>](#src-layout-<src-layout>)) would be imported as`test\_app`and`test\_view`top-level modules by adding`tests/`to`sys.path`.  This results in a drawback compared to the import mode`importlib`: your test files must have **unique names**.  If you need to have test modules with the same name, as a workaround you might add`\_\_init\_\_.py`files to your`tests`folder and subfolders, changing them to packages:`\`text pyproject.toml mypkg/ ... tests/ \_\_init\_\_.py foo/ \_\_init\_\_.py test\_view.py bar/ \_\_init\_\_.py test\_view.py

</div>

Now pytest will load the modules as `tests.foo.test_view` and `tests.bar.test_view`, `` ` allowing you to have modules with the same name. But now this introduces a subtle problem: in order to load the test modules from the ``tests`directory, pytest prepends the root of the repository to`sys.path`, which adds the side-effect that now`mypkg`is also importable.  This is problematic if you are using a tool like tox_ to test your package in a virtual environment, because you want to test the *installed* version of your package, not the local code from the repository.  The`importlib`import mode does not have any of the drawbacks above, because`sys.path``is not changed when importing test modules.     .. _`use tox`:  tox ---  Once you are done with your work and want to make sure that your actual package passes all tests you may want to look into [tox <tox:index>](tox <tox:index>.md), the virtualenv test automation tool.``tox`helps you to setup virtualenv environments with pre-defined dependencies and then executing a pre-configured test command with options.  It will run tests against the installed package and not against your source code checkout, helping to detect packaging glitches.  Do not run via setuptools -------------------------  Integration with setuptools is **not recommended**, i.e. you should not be using`python setup.py test`or`pytest-runner`, and may stop working in the future.  This is deprecated since it depends on deprecated features of setuptools and relies on features that break security mechanisms in pip. For example 'setup_requires' and 'tests_require' bypass`pip --require-hashes\`<span class="title-ref">. For more information and migration instructions, see the \`pytest-runner notice \<https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-runner\#deprecation-notice\></span>\_. See also [pypa/setuptools\#1684](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/1684).

setuptools intends to [remove the test command](https://github.com/pypa/setuptools/issues/931).

## Checking with flake8-pytest-style

In order to ensure that pytest is being used correctly in your project, it can be helpful to use the [flake8-pytest-style](https://github.com/m-burst/flake8-pytest-style) flake8 plugin.

flake8-pytest-style checks for common mistakes and coding style violations in pytest code, such as incorrect use of fixtures, test function names, and markers. By using this plugin, you can catch these errors early in the development process and ensure that your pytest code is consistent and easy to maintain.

A list of the lints detected by flake8-pytest-style can be found on its [PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/flake8-pytest-style/).

\> **Note** \> flake8-pytest-style is not an official pytest project. Some of the rules enforce certain style choices, such as using <span class="title-ref">@pytest.fixture()</span> over <span class="title-ref">@pytest.fixture</span>, but you can configure the plugin to fit your preferred style.

# pytest import mechanisms and `sys.path`/`PYTHONPATH`

## Import modes

pytest as a testing framework that needs to import test modules and `conftest.py` files for execution.

Importing files in Python is a non-trivial process, so aspects of the import process can be controlled through the `--import-mode` command-line flag, which can assume these values:

<div id="import-mode-prepend">

  - `prepend` (default): The directory path containing each module will be inserted into the *beginning* of :py\`sys.path\` if not already there, and then imported with the <span class="title-ref">importlib.import\_module \<importlib.import\_module\></span> function.
    
    It is highly recommended to arrange your test modules as packages by adding `__init__.py` files to your directories containing tests. This will make the tests part of a proper Python package, allowing pytest to resolve their full name (for example `tests.core.test_core` for `test_core.py` inside the `tests.core` package).
    
    If the test directory tree is not arranged as packages, then each test file needs to have a unique name compared to the other test files, otherwise pytest will raise an error if it finds two tests with the same name.
    
    This is the classic mechanism, dating back from the time Python 2 was still supported.

</div>

<div id="import-mode-append">

  - `append`: the directory containing each module is appended to the end of :py\`sys.path\` if not already there, and imported with <span class="title-ref">importlib.import\_module \<importlib.import\_module\></span>.
    
    This better allows users to run test modules against installed versions of a package even if the package under test has the same import root. For example:
    
        testing/__init__.py
        testing/test_pkg_under_test.py
        pkg_under_test/
    
    the tests will run against the installed version of `pkg_under_test` when `--import-mode=append` is used whereas with `prepend`, they would pick up the local version. This kind of confusion is why we advocate for using \[src-layouts \<src-layout\>\](\#src-layouts-\<src-layout\>).
    
    Same as `prepend`, requires test module names to be unique when the test directory tree is not arranged in packages, because the modules will put in :py\`sys.modules\` after importing.

</div>

<div id="import-mode-importlib">

  - `importlib`: this mode uses more fine control mechanisms provided by `importlib` to import test modules, without changing :py\`sys.path\`.
    
    Advantages of this mode:
    
      - pytest will not change :py\`sys.path\` at all.
      - Test module names do not need to be unique -- pytest will generate a unique name automatically based on the `rootdir`.
    
    Disadvantages:
    
      - Test modules can't import each other.
    
      - Testing utility modules in the tests directories (for example a `tests.helpers` module containing test-related functions/classes) are not importable. The recommendation in this case it to place testing utility modules together with the application/library code, for example `app.testing.helpers`.
        
        Important: by "test utility modules", we mean functions/classes which are imported by other tests directly; this does not include fixtures, which should be placed in `conftest.py` files, along with the test modules, and are discovered automatically by pytest.
    
    It works like this:
    
    1.  Given a certain module path, for example `tests/core/test_models.py`, derives a canonical name like `tests.core.test_models` and tries to import it.
        
        For non-test modules, this will work if they are accessible via :py\`sys.path\`. So for example, `.env/lib/site-packages/app/core.py` will be importable as `app.core`. This is happens when plugins import non-test modules (for example doctesting).
        
        If this step succeeds, the module is returned.
        
        For test modules, unless they are reachable from :py\`sys.path\`, this step will fail.
    
    2.  If the previous step fails, we import the module directly using `importlib` facilities, which lets us import it without changing :py\`sys.path\`.
        
        Because Python requires the module to also be available in :py\`sys.modules\`, pytest derives a unique name for it based on its relative location from the `rootdir`, and adds the module to :py\`sys.modules\`.
        
        For example, `tests/core/test_models.py` will end up being imported as the module `tests.core.test_models`.

## `prepend` and `append` import modes scenarios

Here's a list of scenarios when using `prepend` or `append` import modes where pytest needs to change :py\`sys.path\` in order to import test modules or `conftest.py` files, and the issues users might encounter because of that.

### Test modules / `conftest.py` files inside packages

Consider this file and directory layout:

    root/
    |- foo/
       |- __init__.py
       |- conftest.py
       |- bar/
          |- __init__.py
          |- tests/
             |- __init__.py
             |- test_foo.py

When executing:

`` `bash     pytest root/  pytest will find ``foo/bar/tests/test\_foo.py`and realize it is part of a package given that`<span class="title-ref"> there's an </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span><span class="title-ref"> file in the same folder. It will then search upwards until it can find the last folder which still contains an </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span><span class="title-ref"> file in order to find the package \*root\* (in this case </span><span class="title-ref">foo/</span><span class="title-ref">). To load the module, it will insert </span><span class="title-ref">root/</span><span class="title-ref"> to the front of :py\`sys.path</span> (if not there already) in order to load `test_foo.py` as the *module* `foo.bar.tests.test_foo`.

The same logic applies to the `conftest.py` file: it will be imported as `foo.conftest` module.

Preserving the full package name is important when tests live in a package to avoid problems and allow test modules to have duplicated names. This is also discussed in details in \[test discovery\](\#test-discovery).

### Standalone test modules / `conftest.py` files

Consider this file and directory layout:

    root/
    |- foo/
       |- conftest.py
       |- bar/
          |- tests/
             |- test_foo.py

When executing:

`` `bash     pytest root/  pytest will find ``foo/bar/tests/test\_foo.py`and realize it is NOT part of a package given that`<span class="title-ref"> there's no </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span><span class="title-ref"> file in the same folder. It will then add </span><span class="title-ref">root/foo/bar/tests</span><span class="title-ref"> to :py\`sys.path</span> in order to import `test_foo.py` as the *module* `test_foo`. The same is done with the `conftest.py` file by adding `root/foo` to :py\`sys.path\` to import it as `conftest`.

For this reason this layout cannot have test modules with the same name, as they all will be imported in the global import namespace.

This is also discussed in details in \[test discovery\](\#test-discovery).

## Invoking `pytest` versus `python -m pytest`

Running pytest with `pytest [...]` instead of `python -m pytest [...]` yields nearly equivalent behaviour, except that the latter will add the current directory to :py\`sys.path\`, which is standard `python` behavior.

# pytest-2.3: reasoning for fixture/funcarg evolution

**Target audience**: Reading this document requires basic knowledge of python testing, xUnit setup methods and the (previous) basic pytest funcarg mechanism, see \[historical funcargs and pytest.funcargs\](\#historical-funcargs-and-pytest.funcargs). If you are new to pytest, then you can simply ignore this section and read the other sections.

## Shortcomings of the previous `pytest_funcarg__` mechanism

The pre pytest-2.3 funcarg mechanism calls a factory each time a funcarg for a test function is required. If a factory wants to reuse a resource across different scopes, it often used the `request.cached_setup()` helper to manage caching of resources. Here is a basic example how we could implement a per-session Database object:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     class Database:         def __init__(self):             print("database instance created")          def destroy(self):             print("database instance destroyed")       def pytest_funcarg__db(request):         return request.cached_setup(             setup=DataBase, teardown=lambda db: db.destroy, scope="session"         )  There are several limitations and difficulties with this approach:  1. Scoping funcarg resource creation is not straight forward, instead one must    understand the intricate cached_setup() method mechanics.  2. parametrizing the "db" resource is not straight forward:    you need to apply a "parametrize" decorator or implement a    :hook:`pytest_generate_tests` hook    calling :py`~pytest.Metafunc.parametrize` which    performs parametrization at the places where the resource    is used.  Moreover, you need to modify the factory to use an ``extrakey`parameter containing`request.param`to the`Request.cached\_setup`call.  3. Multiple parametrized session-scoped resources will be active    at the same time, making it hard for them to affect global state    of the application under test.  4. there is no way how you can make use of funcarg factories    in xUnit setup methods.  5. A non-parametrized fixture function cannot use a parametrized    funcarg resource if it isn't stated in the test function signature.  All of these limitations are addressed with pytest-2.3 and its`\` improved \[fixture mechanism \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-mechanism-\<fixture\>).

## Direct scoping of fixture/funcarg factories

Instead of calling cached\_setup() with a cache scope, you can use the \[@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture\>\](\#@pytest.fixture-\<pytest.fixture\>) decorator and directly state the scope:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture(scope="session")     def db(request):         # factory will only be invoked once per session -         db = DataBase()         request.addfinalizer(db.destroy)  # destroy when session is finished         return db  This factory implementation does not need to call ``cached\_setup()`anymore`<span class="title-ref"> because it will only be invoked once per session. Moreover, the </span><span class="title-ref">request.addfinalizer()</span>\` registers a finalizer according to the specified resource scope on which the factory function is operating.

## Direct parametrization of funcarg resource factories

Previously, funcarg factories could not directly cause parametrization. You needed to specify a `@parametrize` decorator on your test function or implement a `pytest_generate_tests` hook to perform parametrization, i.e. calling a test multiple times with different value sets. pytest-2.3 introduces a decorator for use on the factory itself:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture(params=["mysql", "pg"])     def db(request): ...  # use request.param  Here the factory will be invoked twice (with the respective "mysql" ``<span class="title-ref"> and "pg" values set as </span><span class="title-ref">request.param</span>\` attributes) and all of the tests requiring "db" will run twice as well. The "mysql" and "pg" values will also be used for reporting the test-invocation variants.

This new way of parametrizing funcarg factories should in many cases allow to reuse already written factories because effectively `request.param` was already used when test functions/classes were parametrized via :py\`metafunc.parametrize(indirect=True) \<pytest.Metafunc.parametrize\>\` calls.

Of course it's perfectly fine to combine parametrization and scoping:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture(scope="session", params=["mysql", "pg"])     def db(request):         if request.param == "mysql":             db = MySQL()         elif request.param == "pg":             db = PG()         request.addfinalizer(db.destroy)  # destroy when session is finished         return db  This would execute all tests requiring the per-session "db" resource twice, ``\` receiving the values created by the two respective invocations to the factory function.

## No `pytest_funcarg__` prefix when using @fixture decorator

When using the `@fixture` decorator the name of the function denotes the name under which the resource can be accessed as a function argument:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture()     def db(request): ...  The name under which the funcarg resource can be requested is ``db`.  You can still use the "old" non-decorator way of specifying funcarg factories`\` aka:

`` `python     def pytest_funcarg__db(request): ...   But it is then not possible to define scoping and parametrization. ``\` It is thus recommended to use the factory decorator.

## solving per-session setup / autouse fixtures

pytest for a long time offered a pytest\_configure and a pytest\_sessionstart hook which are often used to setup global resources. This suffers from several problems:

1.  in distributed testing the managing process would setup test resources that are never needed because it only coordinates the test run activities of the worker processes.
2.  if you only perform a collection (with "--collect-only") resource-setup will still be executed.
3.  If a pytest\_sessionstart is contained in some subdirectories conftest.py file, it will not be called. This stems from the fact that this hook is actually used for reporting, in particular the test-header with platform/custom information.

Moreover, it was not easy to define a scoped setup from plugins or conftest files other than to implement a `pytest_runtest_setup()` hook and caring for scoping/caching yourself. And it's virtually impossible to do this with parametrization as `pytest_runtest_setup()` is called during test execution and parametrization happens at collection time.

It follows that pytest\_configure/session/runtest\_setup are often not appropriate for implementing common fixture needs. Therefore, pytest-2.3 introduces \[autouse fixtures\](\#autouse-fixtures) which fully integrate with the generic \[fixture mechanism \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-mechanism-\<fixture\>) and obsolete many prior uses of pytest hooks.

## funcargs/fixture discovery now happens at collection time

Since pytest-2.3, discovery of fixture/funcarg factories are taken care of at collection time. This is more efficient especially for large test suites. Moreover, a call to "pytest --collect-only" should be able to in the future show a lot of setup-information and thus presents a nice method to get an overview of fixture management in your project.

## Conclusion and compatibility notes<span id="compatibility notes"></span>

**funcargs** were originally introduced to pytest-2.0. In pytest-2.3 the mechanism was extended and refined and is now described as fixtures:

  - previously funcarg factories were specified with a special `pytest_funcarg__NAME` prefix instead of using the `@pytest.fixture` decorator.
  - Factories received a `request` object which managed caching through `request.cached_setup()` calls and allowed using other funcargs via `request.getfuncargvalue()` calls. These intricate APIs made it hard to do proper parametrization and implement resource caching. The new :py\`pytest.fixture\` decorator allows to declare the scope and let pytest figure things out for you.
  - if you used parametrization and funcarg factories which made use of `request.cached_setup()` it is recommended to invest a few minutes and simplify your fixture function code to use the \[@pytest.fixture\](\#@pytest.fixture) decorator instead. This will also allow to take advantage of the automatic per-resource grouping of tests.

# Get Started

## Install `pytest`<span id="getstarted"></span>

`pytest` requires: Python 3.8+ or PyPy3.

1.  Run the following command in your command line:

`` `bash     pip install -U pytest  2. Check that you installed the correct version:  .. code-block:: bash      $ pytest --version     pytest 8.3.3  .. _`simpletest`:  Create your first test ``\` ----------------------------------------------------------

Create a new file called `test_sample.py`, containing a function, and a test:

`` `python     # content of test_sample.py     def func(x):         return x + 1       def test_answer():         assert func(3) == 5  The test  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_sample.py F                                                     [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     _______________________________ test_answer ________________________________          def test_answer():     >       assert func(3) == 5     E       assert 4 == 5     E        +  where 4 = func(3)      test_sample.py:6: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_sample.py::test_answer - assert 4 == 5     ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================  The ``\[100%\]`refers to the overall progress of running all test cases. After it finishes, pytest then shows a failure report because`func(3)`does not return`5`.  > **Note** >      You can use the`assert`statement to verify test expectations. pytest’s [Advanced assertion introspection <python:assert>](#advanced-assertion-introspection-<python:assert>) will intelligently report intermediate values of the assert expression so you can avoid the many names [of JUnit legacy methods <testcase-objects>](#of-junit-legacy-methods-<testcase-objects>).  Run multiple tests`\` ----------------------------------------------------------

`pytest` will run all files of the form [test]()\*.py or \*\_test.py in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, it follows \[standard test discovery rules \<test discovery\>\](\#standard-test-discovery-rules-\<test-discovery\>).

## Assert that a certain exception is raised

Use the \[raises \<assertraises\>\](\#raises-\<assertraises\>) helper to assert that some code raises an exception:

`` `python     # content of test_sysexit.py     import pytest       def f():         raise SystemExit(1)       def test_mytest():         with pytest.raises(SystemExit):             f()  You can also use the context provided by [raises <assertraises>](#raises-<assertraises>) to ``\` assert that an expected exception is part of a raised \`ExceptionGroup\`:

`` `python     # content of test_exceptiongroup.py     import pytest       def f():         raise ExceptionGroup(             "Group message",             [                 RuntimeError(),             ],         )       def test_exception_in_group():         with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:             f()         assert excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError)         assert not excinfo.group_contains(TypeError)  Execute the test function with “quiet” reporting mode:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q test_sysexit.py     .                                                                    [100%]     1 passed in 0.12s  > **Note** >      The ``-q/--quiet`flag keeps the output brief in this and following examples.  Group multiple tests in a class`\` --------------------------------------------------------------

Once you develop multiple tests, you may want to group them into a class. pytest makes it easy to create a class containing more than one test:

`` `python     # content of test_class.py     class TestClass:         def test_one(self):             x = "this"             assert "h" in x          def test_two(self):             x = "hello"             assert hasattr(x, "check") ``pytest`discovers all tests following its [Conventions for Python test discovery <test discovery>](#conventions-for-python-test-discovery-<test-discovery>), so it finds both`[test]()`prefixed functions. There is no need to subclass anything, but make sure to prefix your class with`Test`otherwise the class will be skipped. We can simply run the module by passing its filename:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q test_class.py     .F                                                                   [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ____________________________ TestClass.test_two ____________________________      self = <test_class.TestClass object at 0xdeadbeef0001>          def test_two(self):             x = "hello"     >       assert hasattr(x, "check")     E       AssertionError: assert False     E        +  where False = hasattr('hello', 'check')      test_class.py:8: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_class.py::TestClass::test_two - AssertionError: assert False     1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s  The first test passed and the second failed. You can easily see the intermediate values in the assertion to help you understand the reason for the failure.  Grouping tests in classes can be beneficial for the following reasons:   * Test organization  * Sharing fixtures for tests only in that particular class  * Applying marks at the class level and having them implicitly apply to all tests  Something to be aware of when grouping tests inside classes is that each test has a unique instance of the class.`\` Having each test share the same class instance would be very detrimental to test isolation and would promote poor test practices. This is outlined below:

`` `python     # content of test_class_demo.py     class TestClassDemoInstance:         value = 0          def test_one(self):             self.value = 1             assert self.value == 1          def test_two(self):             assert self.value == 1   .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -k TestClassDemoInstance -q     .F                                                                   [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________ TestClassDemoInstance.test_two ______________________      self = <test_class_demo.TestClassDemoInstance object at 0xdeadbeef0002>          def test_two(self):     >       assert self.value == 1     E       assert 0 == 1     E        +  where 0 = <test_class_demo.TestClassDemoInstance object at 0xdeadbeef0002>.value      test_class_demo.py:9: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_class_demo.py::TestClassDemoInstance::test_two - assert 0 == 1     1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s  Note that attributes added at class level are *class attributes*, so they will be shared between tests.  Request a unique temporary directory for functional tests ``\` --------------------------------------------------------------

`pytest` provides :std\[Builtin fixtures/function arguments \<builtin\>\](Builtin fixtures/function arguments \<builtin\>.md) to request arbitrary resources, like a unique temporary directory:

# Historical Notes

This page lists features or behavior from previous versions of pytest which have changed over the years. They are kept here as a historical note so users looking at old code can find documentation related to them.

## Marker revamp and iteration

<div class="versionchanged">

3.6

</div>

pytest's marker implementation traditionally worked by simply updating the `__dict__` attribute of functions to cumulatively add markers. As a result, markers would unintentionally be passed along class hierarchies in surprising ways. Further, the API for retrieving them was inconsistent, as markers from parameterization would be stored differently than markers applied using the `@pytest.mark` decorator and markers added via `node.add_marker`.

This state of things made it technically next to impossible to use data from markers correctly without having a deep understanding of the internals, leading to subtle and hard to understand bugs in more advanced usages.

Depending on how a marker got declared/changed one would get either a `MarkerInfo` which might contain markers from sibling classes, `MarkDecorators` when marks came from parameterization or from a `node.add_marker` call, discarding prior marks. Also `MarkerInfo` acts like a single mark, when it in fact represents a merged view on multiple marks with the same name.

On top of that markers were not accessible in the same way for modules, classes, and functions/methods. In fact, markers were only accessible in functions, even if they were declared on classes/modules.

A new API to access markers has been introduced in pytest 3.6 in order to solve the problems with the initial design, providing the <span class="title-ref">\_pytest.nodes.Node.iter\_markers</span> method to iterate over markers in a consistent manner and reworking the internals, which solved a great deal of problems with the initial design.

### Updating code

The old `Node.get_marker(name)` function is considered deprecated because it returns an internal `MarkerInfo` object which contains the merged name, `*args` and `**kwargs` of all the markers which apply to that node.

In general there are two scenarios on how markers should be handled:

1\. Marks overwrite each other. Order matters but you only want to think of your mark as a single item. E.g. `log_level('info')` at a module level can be overwritten by `log_level('debug')` for a specific test.

> In this case, use `Node.get_closest_marker(name)`:
> 
>   - \`\`\`python  
>     \# replace this: marker = item.get\_marker("log\_level") if marker: level = marker.args\[0\]
>     
>     \# by this: marker = item.get\_closest\_marker("log\_level") if marker: level = marker.args\[0\]

2\. Marks compose in an additive manner. E.g. `skipif(condition)` marks mean you just want to evaluate all of them, `` ` order doesn't even matter. You probably want to think of your marks as a set here.     In this case iterate over each mark and handle their ``*args\`\` and \`\`*\*kwargs`individually.`\`python \# replace this skipif = item.get\_marker("skipif") if skipif: for condition in skipif.args: \# eval condition ...

> \# by this: for skipif in item.iter\_markers("skipif"): condition = skipif.args\[0\] \# eval condition

Related issues ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Here is a non-exhaustive list of issues fixed by the new implementation:  * Marks don't pick up nested classes (:issue:`199`).  * Markers stain on all related classes (:issue:`568`).  * Combining marks - args and kwargs calculation (:issue:`2897`).  * ``request.node.get\_marker('name')`returns`None``for markers applied in classes (:issue:`902`).  * Marks applied in parametrize are stored as markdecorator (:issue:`2400`).  * Fix marker interaction in a backward incompatible way (:issue:`1670`).  * Refactor marks to get rid of the current "marks transfer" mechanism (:issue:`2363`).  * Introduce FunctionDefinition node, use it in generate_tests (:issue:`2522`).  * Remove named marker attributes and collect markers in items (:issue:`891`).  * skipif mark from parametrize hides module level skipif mark (:issue:`1540`).  * skipif + parametrize not skipping tests (:issue:`1296`).  * Marker transfer incompatible with inheritance (:issue:`535`).  More details can be found in the :pr:`original PR <3317>`.  > **Note** >      in a future major release of pytest we will introduce class based markers,     at which point markers will no longer be limited to instances of :py`~pytest.Mark`.   cache plugin integrated into the core -------------------------------------    The functionality of the [core cache <cache>](#core-cache-<cache>) plugin was previously distributed as a third party plugin named``pytest-cache`.  The core plugin is compatible regarding command line options and API usage except that you can only store/receive data between test runs that is json-serializable.  .. _historical funcargs and pytest.funcargs:  funcargs and`pytest\_funcarg\_\_`---------------------------------    In versions prior to 2.3 there was no`@pytest.fixture`marker and you had to use a magic`pytest\_funcarg\_\_NAME`prefix for the fixture factory.  This remains and will remain supported but is not anymore advertised as the primary means of declaring fixture functions.`@pytest.yield\_fixture`decorator -----------------------------------    Prior to version 2.10, in order to use a`yield`statement to execute teardown code one had to mark a fixture using the`yield\_fixture`marker. From 2.10 onward, normal fixtures can use`yield`directly so the`yield\_fixture`decorator is no longer needed and considered deprecated.`\[pytest\]`header in`setup.cfg`------------------------------------    Prior to 3.0, the supported section name was`\[pytest\]`. Due to how this may collide with some distutils commands, the recommended section name for`setup.cfg`files is now`\[<tool:pytest>\]`.  Note that for`pytest.ini`and`tox.ini`files the section name is`\[pytest\]`.   Applying marks to`@pytest.mark.parametrize`parameters ---------------------------------------------------------    Prior to version 3.1 the supported mechanism for marking values used the syntax:`\`python import pytest

>   - @pytest.mark.parametrize(  
>     "test\_input,expected", \[("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), pytest.mark.xfail(("6\*9", 42))\]
> 
> ) def test\_eval(test\_input, expected): assert eval(test\_input) == expected

This was an initial hack to support the feature but soon was demonstrated to be incomplete, `` ` broken for passing functions or applying multiple marks with the same name but different parameters.  The old syntax is planned to be removed in pytest-4.0. ``@pytest.mark.parametrize`argument names as a tuple ------------------------------------------------------    In versions prior to 2.4 one needed to specify the argument names as a tuple.  This remains valid but the simpler`"name1,name2,..."`comma-separated-string syntax is now advertised first because it's easier to write and produces less line noise.   setup: is now an "autouse fixture" ----------------------------------    During development prior to the pytest-2.3 release the name`pytest.setup`was used but before the release it was renamed and moved to become part of the general fixture mechanism, namely [autouse fixtures](#autouse-fixtures)   .. _string conditions:  Conditions as strings instead of booleans -----------------------------------------    Prior to pytest-2.4 the only way to specify skipif/xfail conditions was to use strings:`\`python import sys

> @pytest.mark.skipif("sys.version\_info \>= (3,3)") def test\_function(): ...

During test function setup the skipif condition is evaluated by calling `` ` ``eval('sys.version\_info \>= (3,0)', namespace)`.  The namespace contains all the module globals, and`os`and`sys`as a minimum.  Since pytest-2.4 [boolean conditions <condition booleans>](#boolean-conditions-<condition-booleans>) are considered preferable because markers can then be freely imported between test modules. With strings you need to import not only the marker but all variables used by the marker, which violates encapsulation.  The reason for specifying the condition as a string was that`pytest`can report a summary of skip conditions based purely on the condition string. With conditions as booleans you are required to specify a`reason`string.  Note that string conditions will remain fully supported and you are free to use them if you have no need for cross-importing markers.  The evaluation of a condition string in`pytest.mark.skipif(conditionstring)`or`pytest.mark.xfail(conditionstring)`takes place in a namespace dictionary which is constructed as follows:  * the namespace is initialized by putting the`sys`and`os`modules   and the pytest`config`object into it.  * updated with the module globals of the test function for which the   expression is applied.  The pytest`config`object allows you to skip based on a test configuration value which you might have added:`\`python @pytest.mark.skipif("not config.getvalue('db')") def test\_function(): ...

The equivalent with "boolean conditions" is:

``` python
@pytest.mark.skipif(not pytest.config.getvalue("db"), reason="--db was not specified")
def test_function():
    pass
```

\> **Note** \> You cannot use `pytest.config.getvalue()` in code imported before pytest's argument parsing takes place. For example, `conftest.py` files are imported before command line parsing and thus `config.getvalue()` will not execute correctly.

`pytest.set_trace()` `` ` ----------------------    Previous to version 2.4 to set a break point in code one needed to use ``pytest.set\_trace()`:`\`python import pytest

>   - def test\_function():  
>     ... pytest.set\_trace() \# invoke PDB debugger and tracing

This is no longer needed and one can use the native `import pdb;pdb.set_trace()` call directly.

For more details see \[breakpoints\](\#breakpoints).

"compat" properties `` ` -------------------    Access of ``Module`,`Function`,`Class`,`Instance`,`File`and`Item`through`Node`instances have long been documented as deprecated, but started to emit warnings from pytest`3.9`and onward.  Users should just`import pytest`and access those objects using the`pytest\`\` module.

# History

pytest has a long and interesting history. The [first commit](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/commit/5992a8ef21424d7571305a8d7e2a3431ee7e1e23) in this repository is from January 2007, and even that commit alone already tells a lot: The repository originally was from the `py` library (later split off to pytest), and it originally was a SVN revision, migrated to Mercurial, and finally migrated to git.

However, the commit says “create the new development trunk” and is already quite big: *435 files changed, 58640 insertions(+)*. This is because pytest originally was born as part of [PyPy](https://www.pypy.org/), to make it easier to write tests for it. Here's how it evolved from there to its own project:

  - Late 2002 / early 2003, [PyPy was born](https://morepypy.blogspot.com/2018/09/the-first-15-years-of-pypy.html).

  - Like that blog post mentioned, from very early on, there was a big focus on testing. There were various `testsupport` files on top of unittest.py, and as early as June 2003, Holger Krekel (`hpk42`) [refactored](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2003-June/000787.html) its test framework to clean things up (`pypy.tool.test`, but still on top of `unittest.py`, with nothing pytest-like yet).

  - In December 2003, there was [another iteration](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/02752373e1b29d89c6bb0a97e5f940caa22bdd63) at improving their testing situation, by Stefan Schwarzer, called `pypy.tool.newtest`.

  - However, it didn’t seem to be around for long, as around June/July 2004, efforts started on a thing called `utest`, offering plain assertions. This seems like the start of something pytest-like, but unfortunately, it's unclear where the test runner's code was at the time. The closest thing still around is [this file](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/0735f9ed287ec20950a7dd0a16fc10810d4f6847), but that doesn’t seem like a complete test runner at all. What can be seen is that there were [various efforts](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commits/branch/default?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search=utest) by Laura Creighton and Samuele Pedroni (`pedronis`) at automatically converting existing tests to the new `utest` framework.

  - Around the same time, for Europython 2004, @hpk42 [started a project](http://web.archive.org/web/20041020215353/http://codespeak.net/svn/user/hpk/talks/std-talk.txt) originally called “std”, intended to be a “complementary standard library” - already laying out the principles behind what later became pytest:
    
    >   - current “batteries included” are very useful, but
    >       - some of them are written in a pretty much java-like style, especially the unittest-framework
    >       - \[…\]
    >       - the best API is one that doesn’t exist
    > 
    > \[…\]
    > 
    >   - a testing package should require as few boilerplate code as possible and offer much flexibility
    >   - it should provide premium quality tracebacks and debugging aid
    > 
    > \[…\]
    > 
    >   - first of all … forget about limited “assertXYZ APIs” and use the real thing, e.g.:
    >     
    >         assert x == y
    > 
    >   - this works with plain python but you get unhelpful “assertion failed” errors with no information
    > 
    >   - std.utest (magic\!) actually reinterprets the assertion expression and offers detailed information about underlying values

  - In September 2004, the `py-dev` mailinglist gets born, which [is now](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/) `pytest-dev`, but thankfully with all the original archives still intact.

  - Around September/October 2004, the `std` project [was renamed](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pypy-dev/2004-September/001565.html) to `py` and `std.utest` became `py.test`. This is also the first time the [entire source code](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/42cf50c412026028e20acd23d518bd92e623ac11), seems to be available, with much of the API still being around today:
    
      - `py.path.local`, which is being phased out of pytest (in favour of pathlib) some 16-17 years later
      - The idea of the collection tree, including `Collector`, `FSCollector`, `Directory`, `PyCollector`, `Module`, `Class`
      - Arguments like `-x` / `--exitfirst`, `-l` / `--showlocals`, `--fulltrace`, `--pdb`, `-S` / `--nocapture` (`-s` / `--capture=off` today), `--collectonly` (`--collect-only` today)

  - In the same month, the `py` library [gets split off](https://foss.heptapod.net/pypy/pypy/-/commit/6bdafe9203ad92eb259270b267189141c53bce33) from `PyPy`

  - It seemed to get rather quiet for a while, and little seemed to happen between October 2004 (removing `py` from PyPy) and January 2007 (first commit in the now-pytest repository). However, there were various discussions about features/ideas on the mailinglist, and `a couple of releases <py/0.8.0-alpha2/#history>` every couple of months:
    
      - March 2006: py 0.8.0-alpha2
      - May 2007: py 0.9.0
      - March 2008: py 0.9.1 (first release to be found [in the pytest changelog](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/blob/main/doc/en/changelog.rst#091)\!)
      - August 2008: py 0.9.2

  - In August 2009, py 1.0.0 was released, [introducing a lot of fundamental features](https://holgerkrekel.net/2009/08/04/pylib-1-0-0-released-the-testing-with-python-innovations-continue/):
    
      - funcargs/fixtures
      - A [plugin architecture](http://web.archive.org/web/20090629032718/https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/extend.html) which still looks very much the same today\!
      - Various [default plugins](http://web.archive.org/web/20091005181132/https://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/plugin/index.html), including [monkeypatch](http://web.archive.org/web/20091012022829/http://codespeak.net/py/dist/test/plugin/how-to/monkeypatch.html)

  - Even back there, the [FAQ](http://web.archive.org/web/20091005222413/http://codespeak.net/py/dist/faq.html) said:
    
    > Clearly, \[a second standard library\] was ambitious and the naming has maybe haunted the project rather than helping it. There may be a project name change and possibly a split up into different projects sometime.
    
    and that finally happened in November 2010, when pytest 2.0.0 [was released](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2010-November/001687.html) as a package separate from `py` (but still called `py.test`).

  - In August 2016, pytest 3.0.0 :std\[was released \<release-3.0.0\>\](\#was-released-\<release-3.0.0\>), which adds `pytest` (rather than `py.test`) as the recommended command-line entry point

Due to this history, it's difficult to answer the question when pytest was started. It depends what point should really be seen as the start of it all. One possible interpretation is to pick Europython 2004, i.e. around June/July 2004.

# How to write and report assertions in tests

## Asserting with the `assert` statement

`pytest` allows you to use the standard Python `assert` for verifying expectations and values in Python tests. For example, you can write the following:

`` `python     # content of test_assert1.py     def f():         return 3       def test_function():         assert f() == 4  to assert that your function returns a certain value. If this assertion fails ``\` you will see the return value of the function call:

`` `pytest     $ pytest test_assert1.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_assert1.py F                                                    [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ test_function _______________________________          def test_function():     >       assert f() == 4     E       assert 3 == 4     E        +  where 3 = f()      test_assert1.py:6: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_assert1.py::test_function - assert 3 == 4     ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s ============================= ``pytest`has support for showing the values of the most common subexpressions`\` including calls, attributes, comparisons, and binary and unary operators. (See \[tbreportdemo\](\#tbreportdemo)). This allows you to use the idiomatic python constructs without boilerplate code while not losing introspection information.

If a message is specified with the assertion like this:

`` `python     assert a % 2 == 0, "value was odd, should be even"  it is printed alongside the assertion introspection in the traceback.  See [assert-details](#assert-details) for more information on assertion introspection.  .. _`assertraises`:  Assertions about expected exceptions ``\` ------------------------------------------

In order to write assertions about raised exceptions, you can use <span class="title-ref">pytest.raises</span> as a context manager like this:

`` `python     import pytest       def test_zero_division():         with pytest.raises(ZeroDivisionError):             1 / 0  and if you need to have access to the actual exception info you may use:  .. code-block:: python      def test_recursion_depth():         with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:              def f():                 f()              f()         assert "maximum recursion" in str(excinfo.value) ``excinfo``is an `~pytest.ExceptionInfo` instance, which is a wrapper around``<span class="title-ref"> the actual exception raised. The main attributes of interest are </span><span class="title-ref">.type</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">.value</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">.traceback</span>\`.

Note that `pytest.raises` will match the exception type or any subclasses (like the standard `except` statement). If you want to check if a block of code is raising an exact exception type, you need to check that explicitly:

`` `python     def test_foo_not_implemented():         def foo():             raise NotImplementedError          with pytest.raises(RuntimeError) as excinfo:             foo()         assert excinfo.type is RuntimeError  The `pytest.raises` call will succeed, even though the function raises `NotImplementedError`, because ``<span class="title-ref"> \`NotImplementedError</span> is a subclass of <span class="title-ref">RuntimeError</span>; however the following <span class="title-ref">assert</span> statement will catch the problem.

### Matching exception messages

You can pass a `match` keyword parameter to the context-manager to test that a regular expression matches on the string representation of an exception (similar to the `TestCase.assertRaisesRegex` method from `unittest`):

`` `python     import pytest       def myfunc():         raise ValueError("Exception 123 raised")       def test_match():         with pytest.raises(ValueError, match=r".* 123 .*"):             myfunc()  Notes:  * The ``match``parameter is matched with the `re.search`   function, so in the above example``match='123'`would have worked as well.`<span class="title-ref"> \* The </span><span class="title-ref">match</span><span class="title-ref"> parameter also matches against \`PEP-678 \<https://peps.python.org/pep-0678/\></span>\_\_ `__notes__`.

### Matching exception groups

You can also use the <span class="title-ref">excinfo.group\_contains() \<pytest.ExceptionInfo.group\_contains\></span> method to test for exceptions returned as part of an \`ExceptionGroup\`:

`` `python     def test_exception_in_group():         with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:             raise ExceptionGroup(                 "Group message",                 [                     RuntimeError("Exception 123 raised"),                 ],             )         assert excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, match=r".* 123 .*")         assert not excinfo.group_contains(TypeError)  The optional ``match`keyword parameter works the same way as for`<span class="title-ref"> \`pytest.raises</span>.

By default `group_contains()` will recursively search for a matching exception at any level of nested `ExceptionGroup` instances. You can specify a `depth` keyword parameter if you only want to match an exception at a specific level; exceptions contained directly in the top `ExceptionGroup` would match `depth=1`.

`` `python     def test_exception_in_group_at_given_depth():         with pytest.raises(ExceptionGroup) as excinfo:             raise ExceptionGroup(                 "Group message",                 [                     RuntimeError(),                     ExceptionGroup(                         "Nested group",                         [                             TypeError(),                         ],                     ),                 ],             )         assert excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, depth=1)         assert excinfo.group_contains(TypeError, depth=2)         assert not excinfo.group_contains(RuntimeError, depth=2)         assert not excinfo.group_contains(TypeError, depth=1)  Alternate form (legacy) ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

There is an alternate form where you pass a function that will be executed, along `*args` and `**kwargs`, and <span class="title-ref">pytest.raises</span> will execute the function with the arguments and assert that the given exception is raised:

`` `python     def func(x):         if x <= 0:             raise ValueError("x needs to be larger than zero")       pytest.raises(ValueError, func, x=-1)  The reporter will provide you with helpful output in case of failures such as *no ``\` exception\* or *wrong exception*.

This form was the original <span class="title-ref">pytest.raises</span> API, developed before the `with` statement was added to the Python language. Nowadays, this form is rarely used, with the context-manager form (using `with`) being considered more readable. Nonetheless, this form is fully supported and not deprecated in any way.

### xfail mark and pytest.raises

It is also possible to specify a `raises` argument to \[pytest.mark.xfail \<pytest.mark.xfail ref\>\](\#pytest.mark.xfail-\<pytest.mark.xfail-ref\>), which checks that the test is failing in a more specific way than just having any exception raised:

`` `python     def f():         raise IndexError()       @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=IndexError)     def test_f():         f()   This will only "xfail" if the test fails by raising ``IndexError`or subclasses.  * Using [pytest.mark.xfail <pytest.mark.xfail ref>](#pytest.mark.xfail-<pytest.mark.xfail-ref>) with the`raises``parameter is probably better for something   like documenting unfixed bugs (where the test describes what "should" happen) or bugs in dependencies.  * Using `pytest.raises` is likely to be better for cases where you are   testing exceptions your own code is deliberately raising, which is the majority of cases.   .. _`assertwarns`:  Assertions about expected warnings``\` -----------------------------------------

You can check that code raises a particular warning using \[pytest.warns \<warns\>\](\#pytest.warns-\<warns\>).

## Making use of context-sensitive comparisons

`pytest` has rich support for providing context-sensitive information when it encounters comparisons. For example:

`` `python     # content of test_assert2.py     def test_set_comparison():         set1 = set("1308")         set2 = set("8035")         assert set1 == set2  if you run this module:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_assert2.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_assert2.py F                                                    [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ___________________________ test_set_comparison ____________________________          def test_set_comparison():             set1 = set("1308")             set2 = set("8035")     >       assert set1 == set2     E       AssertionError: assert {'0', '1', '3', '8'} == {'0', '3', '5', '8'}     E     E         Extra items in the left set:     E         '1'     E         Extra items in the right set:     E         '5'     E         Use -v to get more diff      test_assert2.py:4: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_assert2.py::test_set_comparison - AssertionError: assert {'0'...     ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================  Special comparisons are done for a number of cases:  * comparing long strings: a context diff is shown ``\` \* comparing long sequences: first failing indices \* comparing dicts: different entries

See the \[reporting demo \<tbreportdemo\>\](\#reporting-demo-\<tbreportdemo\>) for many more examples.

## Defining your own explanation for failed assertions

It is possible to add your own detailed explanations by implementing the `pytest_assertrepr_compare` hook.

<div class="autofunction" data-noindex="">

\_pytest.hookspec.pytest\_assertrepr\_compare

</div>

As an example consider adding the following hook in a \[conftest.py \<conftest.py\>\](\#conftest.py-\<conftest.py\>) file which provides an alternative explanation for `Foo` objects:

`` `python    # content of conftest.py    from test_foocompare import Foo      def pytest_assertrepr_compare(op, left, right):        if isinstance(left, Foo) and isinstance(right, Foo) and op == "==":            return [                "Comparing Foo instances:",                f"   vals: {left.val} != {right.val}",            ]  now, given this test module:  .. code-block:: python     # content of test_foocompare.py    class Foo:        def __init__(self, val):            self.val = val         def __eq__(self, other):            return self.val == other.val      def test_compare():        f1 = Foo(1)        f2 = Foo(2)        assert f1 == f2  you can run the test module and get the custom output defined in ``\` the conftest file:

  - `` `pytest    $ pytest -q test_foocompare.py    F                                                                    [100%]    ================================= FAILURES =================================    _______________________________ test_compare _______________________________         def test_compare():            f1 = Foo(1)            f2 = Foo(2)    >       assert f1 == f2    E       assert Comparing Foo instances:    E            vals: 1 != 2     test_foocompare.py:12: AssertionError    ========================= short test summary info ==========================    FAILED test_foocompare.py::test_compare - assert Comparing Foo instances:    1 failed in 0.12s    .. _`assert introspection`:  Assertion introspection details -------------------------------   Reporting details about a failing assertion is achieved by rewriting assert statements before they are run.  Rewritten assert statements put introspection information into the assertion failure message. ``pytest`only rewrites test modules directly discovered by its test collection process, so **asserts in supporting modules which are not themselves test modules will not be rewritten**.  You can manually enable assertion rewriting for an imported module by calling [register_assert_rewrite <assertion-rewriting>](#register_assert_rewrite-<assertion-rewriting>) before you import it (a good place to do that is in your root`conftest.py``).  For further information, Benjamin Peterson wrote up `Behind the scenes of pytest's new assertion rewriting <http://pybites.blogspot.com/2011/07/behind-scenes-of-pytests-new-assertion.html>`_.  Assertion rewriting caches files on disk ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~``pytest`will write back the rewritten modules to disk for caching. You can disable this behavior (for example to avoid leaving stale`.pyc`files around in projects that move files around a lot) by adding this to the top of your`conftest.py`file:`\`python  
    import sys
    
    sys.dont\_write\_bytecode = True

Note that you still get the benefits of assertion introspection, the only change is that `` ` the ``.pyc`files won't be cached on disk.  Additionally, rewriting will silently skip caching if it cannot write new`.pyc`files, i.e. in a read-only filesystem or a zipfile.   Disabling assert rewriting ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~`pytest`rewrites test modules on import by using an import hook to write new`pyc`files. Most of the time this works transparently. However, if you are working with the import machinery yourself, the import hook may interfere.  If this is the case you have two options:  * Disable rewriting for a specific module by adding the string`PYTEST\_DONT\_REWRITE`to its docstring.  * Disable rewriting for all modules by using`--assert=plain\`\`.

# How to set up bash completion

When using bash as your shell, `pytest` can use argcomplete (<https://kislyuk.github.io/argcomplete/>) for auto-completion. For this `argcomplete` needs to be installed **and** enabled.

Install argcomplete using:

`` `bash     sudo pip install 'argcomplete>=0.5.7'  For global activation of all argcomplete enabled python applications run:  .. code-block:: bash      sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete  For permanent (but not global) ``pytest`activation, use:  .. code-block:: bash      register-python-argcomplete pytest >> ~/.bashrc  For one-time activation of argcomplete for`pytest`only, use:  .. code-block:: bash      eval "$(register-python-argcomplete pytest)"`\`

# How to re-run failed tests and maintain state between test runs<span id="cache_provider"></span>

## Usage

The plugin provides two command line options to rerun failures from the last `pytest` invocation:

  - `--lf`, `--last-failed` - to only re-run the failures.
  - `--ff`, `--failed-first` - to run the failures first and then the rest of the tests.

For cleanup (usually not needed), a `--cache-clear` option allows to remove all cross-session cache contents ahead of a test run.

Other plugins may access the [config.cache](#config.cache) object to set/get **json encodable** values between `pytest` invocations.

\> **Note** \> This plugin is enabled by default, but can be disabled if needed: see \[cmdunregister\](\#cmdunregister) (the internal name for this plugin is `cacheprovider`).

## Rerunning only failures or failures first

First, let's create 50 test invocation of which only 2 fail:

`` `python     # content of test_50.py     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize("i", range(50))     def test_num(i):         if i in (17, 25):             pytest.fail("bad luck")  If you run this for the first time you will see two failures:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q     .................F.......F........................

Now, if you run with the `--ff` option, all tests will be run but the first previous failures will be executed first (as can be seen from the series of `FF` and dots):

`` `pytest     $ pytest --ff     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 50 items     run-last-failure: rerun previous 2 failures first      test_50.py FF................................................

## Behavior when no tests failed in the last run

The `--lfnf/--last-failed-no-failures` option governs the behavior of `--last-failed`. Determines whether to execute tests when there are no previously (known) failures or when no cached `lastfailed` data was found.

There are two options:

  - `all`: when there are no known test failures, runs all tests (the full test suite). This is the default.
  - `none`: when there are no known test failures, just emits a message stating this and exit successfully.

Example:

`` `bash     pytest --last-failed --last-failed-no-failures all    # runs the full test suite (default behavior)     pytest --last-failed --last-failed-no-failures none   # runs no tests and exits successfully  The new config.cache object ``\` --------------------------------

Plugins or conftest.py support code can get a cached value using the pytest `config` object. Here is a basic example plugin which implements a \[fixture \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-\<fixture\>) which re-uses previously created state across pytest invocations:

`` `python     # content of test_caching.py     import pytest       def expensive_computation():         print("running expensive computation...")       @pytest.fixture     def mydata(pytestconfig):         val = pytestconfig.cache.get("example/value", None)         if val is None:             expensive_computation()             val = 42             pytestconfig.cache.set("example/value", val)         return val       def test_function(mydata):         assert mydata == 23  If you run this command for the first time, you can see the print statement:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ test_function _______________________________      mydata = 42          def test_function(mydata):     >       assert mydata == 23     E       assert 42 == 23      test_caching.py:19: AssertionError     -------------------------- Captured stdout setup ---------------------------     running expensive computation...     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_caching.py::test_function - assert 42 == 23     1 failed in 0.12s  If you run it a second time, the value will be retrieved from ``\` the cache and nothing will be printed:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ test_function _______________________________      mydata = 42          def test_function(mydata):     >       assert mydata == 23     E       assert 42 == 23      test_caching.py:19: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_caching.py::test_function - assert 42 == 23     1 failed in 0.12s  See the :fixture:`config.cache fixture <cache>` for more details.   Inspecting Cache content ``\` ------------------------

You can always peek at the content of the cache using the `--cache-show` command line option:

`` `pytest     $ pytest --cache-show     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     cachedir: /home/sweet/project/.pytest_cache     --------------------------- cache values for '*' ---------------------------     cache/lastfailed contains:       {'test_caching.py::test_function': True}     cache/nodeids contains:       ['test_caching.py::test_function']     cache/stepwise contains:       []     example/value contains:       42      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s =========================== ``--cache-show`takes an optional argument to specify a glob pattern for`\` filtering:

`` `pytest     $ pytest --cache-show example/*     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     cachedir: /home/sweet/project/.pytest_cache     ----------------------- cache values for 'example/*' -----------------------     example/value contains:       42      ========================== no tests ran in 0.12s ===========================  Clearing Cache content ``\` ----------------------

You can instruct pytest to clear all cache files and values by adding the `--cache-clear` option like this:

`` `bash     pytest --cache-clear  This is recommended for invocations from Continuous Integration ``\` servers where isolation and correctness is more important than speed.

## Stepwise

As an alternative to `--lf -x`, especially for cases where you expect a large part of the test suite will fail, `--sw`, `--stepwise` allows you to fix them one at a time. The test suite will run until the first failure and then stop. At the next invocation, tests will continue from the last failing test and then run until the next failing test. You may use the `--stepwise-skip` option to ignore one failing test and stop the test execution on the second failing test instead. This is useful if you get stuck on a failing test and just want to ignore it until later. Providing `--stepwise-skip` will also enable `--stepwise` implicitly.

# How to capture stdout/stderr output

## Default stdout/stderr/stdin capturing behaviour

During test execution any output sent to `stdout` and `stderr` is captured. If a test or a setup method fails its according captured output will usually be shown along with the failure traceback. (this behavior can be configured by the `--show-capture` command-line option).

In addition, `stdin` is set to a "null" object which will fail on attempts to read from it because it is rarely desired to wait for interactive input when running automated tests.

By default capturing is done by intercepting writes to low level file descriptors. This allows to capture output from simple print statements as well as output from a subprocess started by a test.

## Setting capturing methods or disabling capturing

There are three ways in which `pytest` can perform capturing:

  - `fd` (file descriptor) level capturing (default): All writes going to the operating system file descriptors 1 and 2 will be captured.
  - `sys` level capturing: Only writes to Python files `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` will be captured. No capturing of writes to filedescriptors is performed.
  - `tee-sys` capturing: Python writes to `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` will be captured, however the writes will also be passed-through to the actual `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`. This allows output to be 'live printed' and captured for plugin use, such as junitxml (new in pytest 5.4).

<div id="disable capturing">

You can influence output capturing mechanisms from the command line:

</div>

`` `bash     pytest -s                  # disable all capturing     pytest --capture=sys       # replace sys.stdout/stderr with in-mem files     pytest --capture=fd        # also point filedescriptors 1 and 2 to temp file     pytest --capture=tee-sys   # combines 'sys' and '-s', capturing sys.stdout/stderr                                # and passing it along to the actual sys.stdout/stderr  .. _printdebugging:  Using print statements for debugging ``\` ---------------------------------------------------

One primary benefit of the default capturing of stdout/stderr output is that you can use print statements for debugging:

`` `python     # content of test_module.py       def setup_function(function):         print("setting up", function)       def test_func1():         assert True       def test_func2():         assert False  and running this module will show you precisely the output ``\` of the failing function and hide the other one:

`` `pytest     $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py .F                                                    [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ________________________________ test_func2 ________________________________          def test_func2():     >       assert False     E       assert False      test_module.py:12: AssertionError     -------------------------- Captured stdout setup ---------------------------     setting up <function test_func2 at 0xdeadbeef0001>     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_module.py::test_func2 - assert False     ======================= 1 failed, 1 passed in 0.12s ========================  Accessing captured output from a test function ``\` ---------------------------------------------------

The `capsys`, `capsysbinary`, `capfd`, and `capfdbinary` fixtures allow access to `stdout`/`stderr` output created during test execution.

Here is an example test function that performs some output related checks:

`` `python     def test_myoutput(capsys):  # or use "capfd" for fd-level         print("hello")         sys.stderr.write("world\n")         captured = capsys.readouterr()         assert captured.out == "hello\n"         assert captured.err == "world\n"         print("next")         captured = capsys.readouterr()         assert captured.out == "next\n"  The ``readouterr()`call snapshots the output so far -`<span class="title-ref"> and capturing will be continued. After the test function finishes the original streams will be restored. Using :fixture:\`capsys</span> this way frees your test from having to care about setting/resetting output streams and also interacts well with pytest's own per-test capturing.

The return value from `readouterr` changed to a `namedtuple` with two attributes, `out` and `err`.

If the code under test writes non-textual data (`bytes`), you can capture this using the `capsysbinary` fixture which instead returns `bytes` from the `readouterr` method.

If you want to capture at the file descriptor level you can use the `capfd` fixture which offers the exact same interface but allows to also capture output from libraries or subprocesses that directly write to operating system level output streams (FD1 and FD2). Similarly to `capsysbinary`, `capfdbinary` can be used to capture `bytes` at the file descriptor level.

To temporarily disable capture within a test, the capture fixtures have a `disabled()` method that can be used as a context manager, disabling capture inside the `with` block:

`` `python def test_disabling_capturing(capsys):     print("this output is captured")     with capsys.disabled():         print("output not captured, going directly to sys.stdout")     print("this output is also captured") ``\`

# How to capture warnings

Starting from version `3.1`, pytest now automatically catches warnings during test execution and displays them at the end of the session:

`` `python     # content of test_show_warnings.py     import warnings       def api_v1():         warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))         return 1       def test_one():         assert api_v1() == 1  Running pytest now produces this output:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_show_warnings.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_show_warnings.py .

Similar to Python's [warning filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-filter) and `-W option <python:-W>` flag, pytest provides its own `-W` flag to control which warnings are ignored, displayed, or turned into errors. See the [warning filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-filter) documentation for more advanced use-cases.

This code sample shows how to treat any `UserWarning` category class of warning as an error:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q test_show_warnings.py -W error::UserWarning     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     _________________________________ test_one _________________________________          def test_one():     >       assert api_v1() == 1      test_show_warnings.py:10:     _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _ _          def api_v1():     >       warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))     E       UserWarning: api v1, should use functions from v2      test_show_warnings.py:5: UserWarning     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_show_warnings.py::test_one - UserWarning: api v1, should use ...     1 failed in 0.12s  The same option can be set in the ``pytest.ini`or`pyproject.toml`file using the`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">filterwarnings</span>\` ini option. For example, the configuration below will ignore all user warnings and specific deprecation warnings matching a regex, but will transform all other warnings into errors.

`` `ini     # pytest.ini     [pytest]     filterwarnings =         error         ignore::UserWarning         ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning  .. code-block:: toml      # pyproject.toml     [tool.pytest.ini_options]     filterwarnings = [         "error",         "ignore::UserWarning",         # note the use of single quote below to denote "raw" strings in TOML         'ignore:function ham\(\) is deprecated:DeprecationWarning',     ]   When a warning matches more than one option in the list, the action for the last matching option ``\` is performed.

\> **Note** \> The `-W` flag and the `filterwarnings` ini option use warning filters that are similar in structure, but each configuration option interprets its filter differently. For example, *message* in `filterwarnings` is a string containing a regular expression that the start of the warning message must match, case-insensitively, while *message* in `-W` is a literal string that the start of the warning message must contain (case-insensitively), ignoring any whitespace at the start or end of message. Consult the [warning filter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/warnings.html#warning-filter) documentation for more details.

## `@pytest.mark.filterwarnings`

You can use the \[@pytest.mark.filterwarnings \<pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref\>\](\#@pytest.mark.filterwarnings-\<pytest.mark.filterwarnings-ref\>) mark to add warning filters to specific test items, allowing you to have finer control of which warnings should be captured at test, class or even module level:

`` `python     import warnings       def api_v1():         warnings.warn(UserWarning("api v1, should use functions from v2"))         return 1       @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:api v1")     def test_one():         assert api_v1() == 1   You can specify multiple filters with separate decorators:  .. code-block:: python      # Ignore "api v1" warnings, but fail on all other warnings     @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("ignore:api v1")     @pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error")     def test_one():         assert api_v1() == 1  > **Important** >      Regarding decorator order and filter precedence:     it's important to remember that decorators are evaluated in reverse order,     so you have to list the warning filters in the reverse order     compared to traditional :py`warnings.filterwarnings` and :option:`-W option <python:-W>` usage.     This means in practice that filters from earlier [@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>](#@pytest.mark.filterwarnings-<pytest.mark.filterwarnings-ref>) decorators     take precedence over filters from later decorators, as illustrated in the example above.   Filters applied using a mark take precedence over filters passed on the command line or configured ``<span class="title-ref"> by the :confval:\`filterwarnings</span> ini option.

You may apply a filter to all tests of a class by using the \[filterwarnings \<pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref\>\](\#filterwarnings-\<pytest.mark.filterwarnings-ref\>) mark as a class decorator or to all tests in a module by setting the `pytestmark` variable:

`` `python     # turns all warnings into errors for this module     pytestmark = pytest.mark.filterwarnings("error")   > **Note** >      If you want to apply multiple filters     (by assigning a list of [filterwarnings <pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref>](#filterwarnings-<pytest.mark.filterwarnings-ref>) mark to :globalvar:`pytestmark`),     you must use the traditional :py`warnings.filterwarnings` ordering approach (later filters take precedence),     which is the reverse of the decorator approach mentioned above.   *Credits go to Florian Schulze for the reference implementation in the* `pytest-warnings`_ ``\` *plugin.*

## Disabling warnings summary

Although not recommended, you can use the `--disable-warnings` command-line option to suppress the warning summary entirely from the test run output.

## Disabling warning capture entirely

This plugin is enabled by default but can be disabled entirely in your `pytest.ini` file with:

>   - \`\`\`ini  
>     \[pytest\] addopts = -p no:warnings

Or passing `-p no:warnings` in the command-line. This might be useful if your test suites handles warnings `` ` using an external system.   .. _`deprecation-warnings`:  DeprecationWarning and PendingDeprecationWarning ------------------------------------------------  By default pytest will display ``DeprecationWarning`and`PendingDeprecationWarning``warnings from user code and third-party libraries, as recommended by :pep:`565`. This helps users keep their code modern and avoid breakages when deprecated warnings are effectively removed.  However, in the specific case where users capture any type of warnings in their test, either with `pytest.warns`, `pytest.deprecated_call` or using the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture, no warning will be displayed at all.  Sometimes it is useful to hide some specific deprecation warnings that happen in code that you have no control over (such as third-party libraries), in which case you might use the warning filters options (ini or marks) to ignore those warnings.  For example:``\`ini \[pytest\] filterwarnings = ignore:.*U.*mode is deprecated:DeprecationWarning

This will ignore all warnings of type `DeprecationWarning` where the start of the message matches `` ` the regular expression ``".*U.*mode is deprecated"``.  See [@pytest.mark.filterwarnings <filterwarnings>](#@pytest.mark.filterwarnings-<filterwarnings>) and [Controlling warnings <controlling-warnings>](#controlling-warnings-<controlling-warnings>) for more examples.  > **Note** >      If warnings are configured at the interpreter level, using     the :envvar:`python:PYTHONWARNINGS` environment variable or the``-W``command-line option, pytest will not configure any filters by default.      Also pytest doesn't follow :pep:`506` suggestion of resetting all warning filters because     it might break test suites that configure warning filters themselves     by calling `warnings.simplefilter` (see :issue:`2430` for an example of that).   .. _`ensuring a function triggers a deprecation warning`:  .. _ensuring_function_triggers:  Ensuring code triggers a deprecation warning --------------------------------------------  You can also use `pytest.deprecated_call` for checking that a certain function call triggers a``DeprecationWarning`or`PendingDeprecationWarning`:`\`python import pytest

>   - def test\_myfunction\_deprecated():
>     
>       - with pytest.deprecated\_call():  
>         myfunction(17)

This test will fail if `myfunction` does not issue a deprecation warning `` ` when called with a ``17``argument.     .. _`asserting warnings`:  .. _assertwarnings:  .. _`asserting warnings with the warns function`:  .. _warns:  Asserting warnings with the warns function ------------------------------------------  You can check that code raises a particular warning using `pytest.warns`, which works in a similar manner to [raises <assertraises>](#raises-<assertraises>) (except that [raises <assertraises>](#raises-<assertraises>) does not capture all exceptions, only the``expected\_exception`):`\`python import warnings

> import pytest
> 
>   - def test\_warning():
>     
>       - with pytest.warns(UserWarning):  
>         warnings.warn("my warning", UserWarning)

The test will fail if the warning in question is not raised. Use the keyword `` ` argument ``match`to assert that the warning matches a text or regex. To match a literal string that may contain regular expression metacharacters like`(`or`.`, the pattern can first be escaped with`re.escape`.  Some examples:`\`pycon \>\>\> with warns(UserWarning, match="must be 0 or None"): ... warnings.warn("value must be 0 or None", UserWarning) ...

> \>\>\> with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be d+$"): ... warnings.warn("value must be 42", UserWarning) ...
> 
> \>\>\> with warns(UserWarning, match=r"must be d+$"): ... warnings.warn("this is not here", UserWarning) ... Traceback (most recent call last): ... Failed: DID NOT WARN. No warnings of type ...UserWarning... were emitted...
> 
> \>\>\> with warns(UserWarning, match=re.escape("issue with foo() func")): ... warnings.warn("issue with foo() func") ...

You can also call <span class="title-ref">pytest.warns</span> on a function or code string:

``` python
pytest.warns(expected_warning, func, *args, **kwargs)
pytest.warns(expected_warning, "func(*args, **kwargs)")
```

The function also returns a list of all raised warnings (as `` ` ``warnings.WarningMessage`objects), which you can query for additional information:`\`python with pytest.warns(RuntimeWarning) as record: warnings.warn("another warning", RuntimeWarning)

> \# check that only one warning was raised assert len(record) == 1 \# check that the message matches assert record\[0\].message.args\[0\] == "another warning"

Alternatively, you can examine raised warnings in detail using the `` ` :fixture:`recwarn` fixture (see [below <recwarn>](#below-<recwarn>)).   The :fixture:`recwarn` fixture automatically ensures to reset the warnings filter at the end of the test, so no global state is leaked.  .. _`recording warnings`:  .. _recwarn:  Recording warnings ------------------  You can record raised warnings either using the `pytest.warns` context manager or with the :fixture:`recwarn` fixture.  To record with `pytest.warns` without asserting anything about the warnings, pass no arguments as the expected warning type and it will default to a generic Warning: ``\`python with pytest.warns() as record: warnings.warn("user", UserWarning) warnings.warn("runtime", RuntimeWarning)

> assert len(record) == 2 assert str(record\[0\].message) == "user" assert str(record\[1\].message) == "runtime"

The `recwarn` fixture will record warnings for the whole function:

``` python
import warnings

def test_hello(recwarn):
    warnings.warn("hello", UserWarning)
    assert len(recwarn) == 1
    w = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
    assert issubclass(w.category, UserWarning)
    assert str(w.message) == "hello"
    assert w.filename
    assert w.lineno
```

Both the `recwarn` fixture and the <span class="title-ref">pytest.warns</span> context manager return the same interface for recorded `` ` warnings: a `~_pytest.recwarn.WarningsRecorder` instance. To view the recorded warnings, you can iterate over this instance, call ``len``on it to get the number of recorded warnings, or index into it to get a particular recorded warning.   .. _`warns use cases`:  Additional use cases of warnings in tests -----------------------------------------  Here are some use cases involving warnings that often come up in tests, and suggestions on how to deal with them:  - To ensure that **at least one** of the indicated warnings is issued, use:``\`python def test\_warning(): with pytest.warns((RuntimeWarning, UserWarning)): ...

  - To ensure that **only** certain warnings are issued, use:

<!-- end list -->

``` python
def test_warning(recwarn):
    ...
    assert len(recwarn) == 1
    user_warning = recwarn.pop(UserWarning)
    assert issubclass(user_warning.category, UserWarning)
```

  - To ensure that **no** warnings are emitted, use:

<!-- end list -->

``` python
def test_warning():
    with warnings.catch_warnings():
        warnings.simplefilter("error")
        ...
```

  - To suppress warnings, use:

<!-- end list -->

``` python
with warnings.catch_warnings():
    warnings.simplefilter("ignore")
    ...
```

<div id="custom_failure_messages">

Custom failure messages `` ` -----------------------  Recording warnings provides an opportunity to produce custom test failure messages for when no warnings are issued or other conditions are met. ``\`python def test(): with pytest.warns(Warning) as record: f() if not record: pytest.fail("Expected a warning\!")

</div>

If no warnings are issued when calling `f`, then `not record` will `` ` evaluate to ``True``.  You can then call `pytest.fail` with a custom error message.  .. _internal-warnings:  Internal pytest warnings ------------------------  pytest may generate its own warnings in some situations, such as improper usage or deprecated features.  For example, pytest will emit a warning if it encounters a class that matches :confval:`python_classes` but also defines an``\_\_init\_\_`constructor, as this prevents the class from being instantiated:`\`python \# content of test\_pytest\_warnings.py class Test: def \_\_init\_\_(self): pass

>   - def test\_foo(self):  
>     assert 1 == 1

``` pytest
$ pytest test_pytest_warnings.py -q

============================= warnings summary =============================
test_pytest_warnings.py:1
  /home/sweet/project/test_pytest_warnings.py:1: PytestCollectionWarning: cannot collect test class 'Test' because it has a __init__ constructor (from: test_pytest_warnings.py)
    class Test:

-- Docs: https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/capture-warnings.html
1 warning in 0.12s
```

These warnings might be filtered using the same builtin mechanisms used to filter other types of warnings.

Please read our \[backwards-compatibility\](\#backwards-compatibility) to learn how we proceed about deprecating and eventually removing `` ` features.  The full list of warnings is listed in [the reference documentation <warnings ref>](#the-reference-documentation-<warnings-ref>).   .. _`resource-warnings`:  Resource Warnings -----------------  Additional information of the source of a `ResourceWarning` can be obtained when captured by pytest if :mod:`tracemalloc` module is enabled.  One convenient way to enable :mod:`tracemalloc` when running tests is to set the :envvar:`PYTHONTRACEMALLOC` to a large enough number of frames (say ``20\`\`, but that number is application dependent).

For more information, consult the [Python Development Mode](https://docs.python.org/3/library/devmode.html) section in the Python documentation.

# How to run doctests

By default, all files matching the `test*.txt` pattern will be run through the python standard `doctest` module. You can change the pattern by issuing:

`` `bash     pytest --doctest-glob="*.rst"  on the command line. ``--doctest-glob`can be given multiple times in the command-line.  If you then have a text file like this:  .. code-block:: text      # content of test_example.txt      hello this is a doctest     >>> x = 3     >>> x     3  then you can just invoke`pytest`directly:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_example.txt .                                                   [100%]      ============================ 1 passed in 0.12s =============================  By default, pytest will collect`test\*.txt`files looking for doctest directives, but you`<span class="title-ref"> can pass additional globs using the </span><span class="title-ref">--doctest-glob</span>\` option (multi-allowed).

In addition to text files, you can also execute doctests directly from docstrings of your classes and functions, including from test modules:

`` `python     # content of mymodule.py     def something():         """a doctest in a docstring         >>> something()         42         """         return 42  .. code-block:: bash      $ pytest --doctest-modules     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      mymodule.py .                                                        [ 50%]     test_example.txt .                                                   [100%]      ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================  You can make these changes permanent in your project by ``\` putting them into a pytest.ini file like this:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     addopts = --doctest-modules   Encoding ``\` --------

The default encoding is **UTF-8**, but you can specify the encoding that will be used for those doctest files using the `doctest_encoding` ini option:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     doctest_encoding = latin1  .. _using doctest options:  Using 'doctest' options ``\` -----------------------

Python's standard `doctest` module provides some \[options \<python:option-flags-and-directives\>\](\#options-\<python:option-flags-and-directives\>) to configure the strictness of doctest tests. In pytest, you can enable those flags using the configuration file.

For example, to make pytest ignore trailing whitespaces and ignore lengthy exception stack traces you can just write:

`` `ini     [pytest]     doctest_optionflags = NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL  Alternatively, options can be enabled by an inline comment in the doc test ``\` itself:

`` `rst     >>> something_that_raises()  # doctest: +IGNORE_EXCEPTION_DETAIL     Traceback (most recent call last):     ValueError: ...  pytest also introduces new options:  * ``ALLOW\_UNICODE`: when enabled, the`u`prefix is stripped from unicode   strings in expected doctest output. This allows doctests to run in Python 2   and Python 3 unchanged.  *`ALLOW\_BYTES`: similarly, the`b`prefix is stripped from byte strings   in expected doctest output.  *`NUMBER``: when enabled, floating-point numbers only need to match as far as   the precision you have written in the expected doctest output. The numbers are   compared using `pytest.approx` with relative tolerance equal to the   precision. For example, the following output would only need to match to 2   decimal places when comparing``3.14`to`pytest.approx(math.pi, rel=10\*\*-2)`::        >>> math.pi       3.14    If you wrote`3.1416`then the actual output would need to match to   approximately 4 decimal places; and so on.    This avoids false positives caused by limited floating-point precision, like   this::        Expected:           0.233       Got:           0.23300000000000001`NUMBER`also supports lists of floating-point numbers -- in fact, it   matches floating-point numbers appearing anywhere in the output, even inside   a string! This means that it may not be appropriate to enable globally in`doctest\_optionflags`in your configuration file.    .. versionadded:: 5.1   Continue on failure`\` -------------------

By default, pytest would report only the first failure for a given doctest. If you want to continue the test even when you have failures, do:

`` `bash     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-continue-on-failure   Output format ``\` -------------

You can change the diff output format on failure for your doctests by using one of standard doctest modules format in options (see <span class="title-ref">python:doctest.REPORT\_UDIFF</span>, <span class="title-ref">python:doctest.REPORT\_CDIFF</span>, <span class="title-ref">python:doctest.REPORT\_NDIFF</span>, <span class="title-ref">python:doctest.REPORT\_ONLY\_FIRST\_FAILURE</span>):

`` `bash     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report none     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report udiff     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report cdiff     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report ndiff     pytest --doctest-modules --doctest-report only_first_failure   pytest-specific features ``\` ------------------------

Some features are provided to make writing doctests easier or with better integration with your existing test suite. Keep in mind however that by using those features you will make your doctests incompatible with the standard `doctests` module.

## Using fixtures

It is possible to use fixtures using the `getfixture` helper:

`` `text     # content of example.rst     >>> tmp = getfixture('tmp_path')     >>> ...     >>>  Note that the fixture needs to be defined in a place visible by pytest, for example, a `conftest.py` ``<span class="title-ref"> file or plugin; normal python files containing docstrings are not normally scanned for fixtures unless explicitly configured by :confval:\`python\_files</span>.

Also, the \[usefixtures \<usefixtures\>\](\#usefixtures-\<usefixtures\>) mark and fixtures marked as \[autouse \<autouse\>\](\#autouse-\<autouse\>) are supported when executing text doctest files.

## 'doctest\_namespace' fixture

The `doctest_namespace` fixture can be used to inject items into the namespace in which your doctests run. It is intended to be used within your own fixtures to provide the tests that use them with context.

`doctest_namespace` is a standard `dict` object into which you place the objects you want to appear in the doctest namespace:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import pytest     import numpy       @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)     def add_np(doctest_namespace):         doctest_namespace["np"] = numpy  which can then be used in your doctests directly:  .. code-block:: python      # content of numpy.py     def arange():         """         >>> a = np.arange(10)         >>> len(a)         10         """  Note that like the normal ``conftest.py`, the fixtures are discovered in the directory tree conftest is in.`\` Meaning that if you put your doctest with your source code, the relevant conftest.py needs to be in the same directory tree. Fixtures will not be discovered in a sibling directory tree\!

## Skipping tests

For the same reasons one might want to skip normal tests, it is also possible to skip tests inside doctests.

To skip a single check inside a doctest you can use the standard <span class="title-ref">doctest.SKIP</span> directive:

`` `python     def test_random(y):         """         >>> random.random()  # doctest: +SKIP         0.156231223          >>> 1 + 1         2         """  This will skip the first check, but not the second.  pytest also allows using the standard pytest functions `pytest.skip` and ``<span class="title-ref"> \`pytest.xfail</span> inside doctests, which might be useful because you can then skip/xfail tests based on external conditions:

`` `text     >>> import sys, pytest     >>> if sys.platform.startswith('win'):     ...     pytest.skip('this doctest does not work on Windows')     ...     >>> import fcntl     >>> ...  However using those functions is discouraged because it reduces the readability of the ``\` docstring.

\> **Note** \> <span class="title-ref">pytest.skip</span> and <span class="title-ref">pytest.xfail</span> behave differently depending if the doctests are in a Python file (in docstrings) or a text file containing doctests intermingled with text:

>   - Python modules (docstrings): the functions only act in that specific docstring, letting the other docstrings in the same module execute as normal.
>   - Text files: the functions will skip/xfail the checks for the rest of the entire file.

### Alternatives

While the built-in pytest support provides a good set of functionalities for using doctests, if you use them extensively you might be interested in those external packages which add many more features, and include pytest integration:

  - [pytest-doctestplus](https://github.com/astropy/pytest-doctestplus): provides advanced doctest support and enables the testing of reStructuredText (".rst") files.
  - [Sybil](https://sybil.readthedocs.io): provides a way to test examples in your documentation by parsing them from the documentation source and evaluating the parsed examples as part of your normal test run.

# How to use pytest with an existing test suite

Pytest can be used with most existing test suites, but its behavior differs from other test runners such as Python's default unittest framework.

Before using this section you will want to \[install pytest \<getstarted\>\](\#install-pytest-\<getstarted\>).

## Running an existing test suite with pytest

Say you want to contribute to an existing repository somewhere. After pulling the code into your development space using some flavor of version control and (optionally) setting up a virtualenv you will want to run:

`` `bash     cd <repository>     pip install -e .  # Environment dependent alternatives include                       # 'python setup.py develop' and 'conda develop'  in your project root.  This will set up a symlink to your code in ``\` site-packages, allowing you to edit your code while your tests run against it as if it were installed.

Setting up your project in development mode lets you avoid having to reinstall every time you want to run your tests, and is less brittle than mucking about with sys.path to point your tests at local code.

Also consider using \[tox \<use tox\>\](\#tox-\<use-tox\>).

# How to handle test failures

## Stopping after the first (or N) failures

To stop the testing process after the first (N) failures:

`` `bash     pytest -x           # stop after first failure     pytest --maxfail=2  # stop after two failures   .. _pdb-option:  Using [python:library/pdb](python:library/pdb.md) with pytest ``\` -------------------------------------------

Dropping to \[pdb \<python:library/pdb\>\](pdb \<python:library/pdb\>.md) on failures \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

Python comes with a builtin Python debugger called \[pdb \<python:library/pdb\>\](pdb \<python:library/pdb\>.md). `pytest` allows one to drop into the \[pdb \<python:library/pdb\>\](pdb \<python:library/pdb\>.md) prompt via a command line option:

`` `bash     pytest --pdb  This will invoke the Python debugger on every failure (or KeyboardInterrupt). ``\` Often you might only want to do this for the first failing test to understand a certain failure situation:

`` `bash     pytest -x --pdb   # drop to PDB on first failure, then end test session     pytest --pdb --maxfail=3  # drop to PDB for first three failures  Note that on any failure the exception information is stored on ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">sys.last\_value</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">sys.last\_type</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">sys.last\_traceback</span>\`. In interactive use, this allows one to drop into postmortem debugging with any debug tool. One can also manually access the exception information, for example:

    >>> import sys
    >>> sys.last_traceback.tb_lineno
    42
    >>> sys.last_value
    AssertionError('assert result == "ok"',)

<div id="trace-option">

Dropping to \[pdb \<python:library/pdb\>\](pdb \<python:library/pdb\>.md) at the start of a test \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

</div>

`pytest` allows one to drop into the \[pdb \<python:library/pdb\>\](pdb \<python:library/pdb\>.md) prompt immediately at the start of each test via a command line option:

`` `bash     pytest --trace  This will invoke the Python debugger at the start of every test.  .. _breakpoints:  Setting breakpoints ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

To set a breakpoint in your code use the native Python `import pdb;pdb.set_trace()` call in your code and pytest automatically disables its output capture for that test:

  - Output capture in other tests is not affected.
  - Any prior test output that has already been captured and will be processed as such.
  - Output capture gets resumed when ending the debugger session (via the `continue` command).

### Using the builtin breakpoint function

Python 3.7 introduces a builtin `breakpoint()` function. Pytest supports the use of `breakpoint()` with the following behaviours:

>   - When `breakpoint()` is called and `PYTHONBREAKPOINT` is set to the default value, pytest will use the custom internal PDB trace UI instead of the system default `Pdb`.
>   - When tests are complete, the system will default back to the system `Pdb` trace UI.
>   - With `--pdb` passed to pytest, the custom internal Pdb trace UI is used with both `breakpoint()` and failed tests/unhandled exceptions.
>   - `--pdbcls` can be used to specify a custom debugger class.

## Fault Handler

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

</div>

The `faulthandler` standard module can be used to dump Python tracebacks on a segfault or after a timeout.

The module is automatically enabled for pytest runs, unless the `-p no:faulthandler` is given on the command-line.

Also the `faulthandler_timeout=X<faulthandler_timeout>` configuration option can be used to dump the traceback of all threads if a test takes longer than `X` seconds to finish (not available on Windows).

\> **Note** \> This functionality has been integrated from the external [pytest-faulthandler](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-faulthandler) plugin, with two small differences:

>   - To disable it, use `-p no:faulthandler` instead of `--no-faulthandler`: the former can be used with any plugin, so it saves one option.
>   - The `--faulthandler-timeout` command-line option has become the `faulthandler_timeout` configuration option. It can still be configured from the command-line using `-o faulthandler_timeout=X`.

## Warning about unraisable exceptions and unhandled thread exceptions

<div class="versionadded">

6.2

</div>

Unhandled exceptions are exceptions that are raised in a situation in which they cannot propagate to a caller. The most common case is an exception raised in a <span class="title-ref">\_\_del\_\_ \<object.\_\_del\_\_\></span> implementation.

Unhandled thread exceptions are exceptions raised in a <span class="title-ref">\~threading.Thread</span> but not handled, causing the thread to terminate uncleanly.

Both types of exceptions are normally considered bugs, but may go unnoticed because they don't cause the program itself to crash. Pytest detects these conditions and issues a warning that is visible in the test run summary.

The plugins are automatically enabled for pytest runs, unless the `-p no:unraisableexception` (for unraisable exceptions) and `-p no:threadexception` (for thread exceptions) options are given on the command-line.

The warnings may be silenced selectively using the \[pytest.mark.filterwarnings ref\](\#pytest.mark.filterwarnings-ref) mark. The warning categories are <span class="title-ref">pytest.PytestUnraisableExceptionWarning</span> and <span class="title-ref">pytest.PytestUnhandledThreadExceptionWarning</span>.

## "Requesting" fixtures

At a basic level, test functions request fixtures they require by declaring them as arguments.

When pytest goes to run a test, it looks at the parameters in that test function's signature, and then searches for fixtures that have the same names as those parameters. Once pytest finds them, it runs those fixtures, captures what they returned (if anything), and passes those objects into the test function as arguments.

### Quick example

`` `python     import pytest       class Fruit:         def __init__(self, name):             self.name = name             self.cubed = False          def cube(self):             self.cubed = True       class FruitSalad:         def __init__(self, *fruit_bowl):             self.fruit = fruit_bowl             self._cube_fruit()          def _cube_fruit(self):             for fruit in self.fruit:                 fruit.cube()       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def fruit_bowl():         return [Fruit("apple"), Fruit("banana")]       def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):         # Act         fruit_salad = FruitSalad(*fruit_bowl)          # Assert         assert all(fruit.cubed for fruit in fruit_salad.fruit)  In this example, ``test\_fruit\_salad`"**requests**"`fruit\_bowl`(i.e.`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">def test\_fruit\_salad(fruit\_bowl):</span><span class="title-ref">), and when pytest sees this, it will execute the </span><span class="title-ref">fruit\_bowl</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture function and pass the object it returns into </span><span class="title-ref">test\_fruit\_salad</span><span class="title-ref"> as the </span><span class="title-ref">fruit\_bowl</span>\` argument.

Here's roughly what's happening if we were to do it by hand:

`` `python     def fruit_bowl():         return [Fruit("apple"), Fruit("banana")]       def test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl):         # Act         fruit_salad = FruitSalad(*fruit_bowl)          # Assert         assert all(fruit.cubed for fruit in fruit_salad.fruit)       # Arrange     bowl = fruit_bowl()     test_fruit_salad(fruit_bowl=bowl)   Fixtures can **request** other fixtures ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of pytest's greatest strengths is its extremely flexible fixture system. It allows us to boil down complex requirements for tests into more simple and organized functions, where we only need to have each one describe the things they are dependent on. We'll get more into this further down, but for now, here's a quick example to demonstrate how fixtures can use other fixtures:

`` `python     # contents of test_append.py     import pytest       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def first_entry():         return "a"       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def order(first_entry):         return [first_entry]       def test_string(order):         # Act         order.append("b")          # Assert         assert order == ["a", "b"]   Notice that this is the same example from above, but very little changed. The ``\` fixtures in pytest **request** fixtures just like tests. All the same **requesting** rules apply to fixtures that do for tests. Here's how this example would work if we did it by hand:

`` `python     def first_entry():         return "a"       def order(first_entry):         return [first_entry]       def test_string(order):         # Act         order.append("b")          # Assert         assert order == ["a", "b"]       entry = first_entry()     the_list = order(first_entry=entry)     test_string(order=the_list)  Fixtures are reusable ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

One of the things that makes pytest's fixture system so powerful, is that it gives us the ability to define a generic setup step that can be reused over and over, just like a normal function would be used. Two different tests can request the same fixture and have pytest give each test their own result from that fixture.

This is extremely useful for making sure tests aren't affected by each other. We can use this system to make sure each test gets its own fresh batch of data and is starting from a clean state so it can provide consistent, repeatable results.

Here's an example of how this can come in handy:

`` `python     # contents of test_append.py     import pytest       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def first_entry():         return "a"       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def order(first_entry):         return [first_entry]       def test_string(order):         # Act         order.append("b")          # Assert         assert order == ["a", "b"]       def test_int(order):         # Act         order.append(2)          # Assert         assert order == ["a", 2]   Each test here is being given its own copy of that ``list`object,`<span class="title-ref"> which means the </span><span class="title-ref">order</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture is getting executed twice (the same is true for the </span><span class="title-ref">first\_entry</span>\` fixture). If we were to do this by hand as well, it would look something like this:

`` `python     def first_entry():         return "a"       def order(first_entry):         return [first_entry]       def test_string(order):         # Act         order.append("b")          # Assert         assert order == ["a", "b"]       def test_int(order):         # Act         order.append(2)          # Assert         assert order == ["a", 2]       entry = first_entry()     the_list = order(first_entry=entry)     test_string(order=the_list)      entry = first_entry()     the_list = order(first_entry=entry)     test_int(order=the_list)  A test/fixture can **request** more than one fixture at a time ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Tests and fixtures aren't limited to **requesting** a single fixture at a time. They can request as many as they like. Here's another quick example to demonstrate:

`` `python     # contents of test_append.py     import pytest       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def first_entry():         return "a"       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def second_entry():         return 2       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def order(first_entry, second_entry):         return [first_entry, second_entry]       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def expected_list():         return ["a", 2, 3.0]       def test_string(order, expected_list):         # Act         order.append(3.0)          # Assert         assert order == expected_list  Fixtures can be **requested** more than once per test (return values are cached) ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixtures can also be **requested** more than once during the same test, and pytest won't execute them again for that test. This means we can **request** fixtures in multiple fixtures that are dependent on them (and even again in the test itself) without those fixtures being executed more than once.

`` `python     # contents of test_append.py     import pytest       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def first_entry():         return "a"       # Arrange     @pytest.fixture     def order():         return []       # Act     @pytest.fixture     def append_first(order, first_entry):         return order.append(first_entry)       def test_string_only(append_first, order, first_entry):         # Assert         assert order == [first_entry]  If a **requested** fixture was executed once for every time it was **requested** ``<span class="title-ref"> during a test, then this test would fail because both </span><span class="title-ref">append\_first</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">test\_string\_only</span><span class="title-ref"> would see </span><span class="title-ref">order</span><span class="title-ref"> as an empty list (i.e. </span><span class="title-ref">\[\]</span><span class="title-ref">), but since the return value of </span><span class="title-ref">order</span><span class="title-ref"> was cached (along with any side effects executing it may have had) after the first time it was called, both the test and </span><span class="title-ref">append\_first</span><span class="title-ref"> were referencing the same object, and the test saw the effect </span><span class="title-ref">append\_first</span>\` had on that object.

## Autouse fixtures (fixtures you don't have to request)<span id="autouse"></span>

Sometimes you may want to have a fixture (or even several) that you know all your tests will depend on. "Autouse" fixtures are a convenient way to make all tests automatically **request** them. This can cut out a lot of redundant **requests**, and can even provide more advanced fixture usage (more on that further down).

We can make a fixture an autouse fixture by passing in `autouse=True` to the fixture's decorator. Here's a simple example for how they can be used:

`` `python     # contents of test_append.py     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def first_entry():         return "a"       @pytest.fixture     def order(first_entry):         return []       @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)     def append_first(order, first_entry):         return order.append(first_entry)       def test_string_only(order, first_entry):         assert order == [first_entry]       def test_string_and_int(order, first_entry):         order.append(2)         assert order == [first_entry, 2]  In this example, the ``append\_first`fixture is an autouse fixture. Because it`\` happens automatically, both tests are affected by it, even though neither test **requested** it. That doesn't mean they *can't* be **requested** though; just that it isn't *necessary*.

## Scope: sharing fixtures across classes, modules, packages or session

Fixtures requiring network access depend on connectivity and are usually time-expensive to create. Extending the previous example, we can add a `scope="module"` parameter to the :py\`@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture\><span class="title-ref"> invocation to cause a </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture function, responsible to create a connection to a preexisting SMTP server, to only be invoked once per test \*module\* (the default is to invoke once per test \*function\*). Multiple test functions in a test module will thus each receive the same </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture instance, thus saving time. Possible values for </span><span class="title-ref">scope</span><span class="title-ref"> are: </span><span class="title-ref">function</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">class</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">module</span><span class="title-ref">, </span><span class="title-ref">package</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">session</span>\`.

The next example puts the fixture function into a separate `conftest.py` file so that tests from multiple test modules in the directory can access the fixture function:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import smtplib      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="module")     def smtp_connection():         return smtplib.SMTP("smtp.gmail.com", 587, timeout=5)   .. code-block:: python      # content of test_module.py       def test_ehlo(smtp_connection):         response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo()         assert response == 250         assert b"smtp.gmail.com" in msg         assert 0  # for demo purposes       def test_noop(smtp_connection):         response, msg = smtp_connection.noop()         assert response == 250         assert 0  # for demo purposes  Here, the ``test\_ehlo`needs the`smtp\_connection`fixture value.  pytest`<span class="title-ref"> will discover and call the :py</span>@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture\><span class="title-ref"> marked </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span>\` fixture function. Running the test looks like this:

`` `pytest     $ pytest test_module.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_module.py FF                                                    [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ________________________________ test_ehlo _________________________________      smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0001>          def test_ehlo(smtp_connection):             response, msg = smtp_connection.ehlo()             assert response == 250             assert b"smtp.gmail.com" in msg     >       assert 0  # for demo purposes     E       assert 0      test_module.py:7: AssertionError     ________________________________ test_noop _________________________________      smtp_connection = <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0001>          def test_noop(smtp_connection):             response, msg = smtp_connection.noop()             assert response == 250     >       assert 0  # for demo purposes     E       assert 0      test_module.py:13: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_module.py::test_ehlo - assert 0     FAILED test_module.py::test_noop - assert 0     ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================  You see the two ``assert 0`failing and more importantly you can also see`<span class="title-ref"> that the \*\*exactly same\*\* </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span><span class="title-ref"> object was passed into the two test functions because pytest shows the incoming argument values in the traceback. As a result, the two test functions using </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span>\` run as quick as a single one because they reuse the same instance.

If you decide that you rather want to have a session-scoped `smtp_connection` instance, you can simply declare it:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture(scope="session")     def smtp_connection():         # the returned fixture value will be shared for         # all tests requesting it         ...   Fixture scopes ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Fixtures are created when first requested by a test, and are destroyed based on their `scope`:

  - `function`: the default scope, the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test.
  - `class`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the class.
  - `module`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the module.
  - `package`: the fixture is destroyed during teardown of the last test in the package where the fixture is defined, including sub-packages and sub-directories within it.
  - `session`: the fixture is destroyed at the end of the test session.

\> **Note** \> Pytest only caches one instance of a fixture at a time, which means that when using a parametrized fixture, pytest may invoke a fixture more than once in the given scope.

### Dynamic scope

<div class="versionadded">

5.2

</div>

In some cases, you might want to change the scope of the fixture without changing the code. To do that, pass a callable to `scope`. The callable must return a string with a valid scope and will be executed only once - during the fixture definition. It will be called with two keyword arguments - `fixture_name` as a string and `config` with a configuration object.

This can be especially useful when dealing with fixtures that need time for setup, like spawning a docker container. You can use the command-line argument to control the scope of the spawned containers for different environments. See the example below.

`` `python     def determine_scope(fixture_name, config):         if config.getoption("--keep-containers", None):             return "session"         return "function"       @pytest.fixture(scope=determine_scope)     def docker_container():         yield spawn_container()    .. _`finalization`:  Teardown/Cleanup (AKA Fixture finalization) ``\` -------------------------------------------

When we run our tests, we'll want to make sure they clean up after themselves so they don't mess with any other tests (and also so that we don't leave behind a mountain of test data to bloat the system). Fixtures in pytest offer a very useful teardown system, which allows us to define the specific steps necessary for each fixture to clean up after itself.

This system can be leveraged in two ways.

### 1\. `yield` fixtures (recommended)

"Yield" fixtures `yield` instead of `return`. With these fixtures, we can run some code and pass an object back to the requesting fixture/test, just like with the other fixtures. The only differences are:

1.  `return` is swapped out for `yield`.
2.  Any teardown code for that fixture is placed *after* the `yield`.

Once pytest figures out a linear order for the fixtures, it will run each one up until it returns or yields, and then move on to the next fixture in the list to do the same thing.

Once the test is finished, pytest will go back down the list of fixtures, but in the *reverse order*, taking each one that yielded, and running the code inside it that was *after* the `yield` statement.

As a simple example, consider this basic email module:

`` `python     # content of emaillib.py     class MailAdminClient:         def create_user(self):             return MailUser()          def delete_user(self, user):             # do some cleanup             pass       class MailUser:         def __init__(self):             self.inbox = []          def send_email(self, email, other):             other.inbox.append(email)          def clear_mailbox(self):             self.inbox.clear()       class Email:         def __init__(self, subject, body):             self.subject = subject             self.body = body  Let's say we want to test sending email from one user to another. We'll have to ``\` first make each user, then send the email from one user to the other, and finally assert that the other user received that message in their inbox. If we want to clean up after the test runs, we'll likely have to make sure the other user's mailbox is emptied before deleting that user, otherwise the system may complain.

Here's what that might look like:

`` `python     # content of test_emaillib.py     from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient      import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def mail_admin():         return MailAdminClient()       @pytest.fixture     def sending_user(mail_admin):         user = mail_admin.create_user()         yield user         mail_admin.delete_user(user)       @pytest.fixture     def receiving_user(mail_admin):         user = mail_admin.create_user()         yield user         user.clear_mailbox()         mail_admin.delete_user(user)       def test_email_received(sending_user, receiving_user):         email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")         sending_user.send_email(email, receiving_user)         assert email in receiving_user.inbox  Because ``receiving\_user`is the last fixture to run during setup, it's the first to run`\` during teardown.

There is a risk that even having the order right on the teardown side of things doesn't guarantee a safe cleanup. That's covered in a bit more detail in \[safe teardowns\](\#safe-teardowns).

`` `pytest    $ pytest -q test_emaillib.py    .                                                                    [100%]    1 passed in 0.12s  Handling errors for yield fixture ``\` """""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

If a yield fixture raises an exception before yielding, pytest won't try to run the teardown code after that yield fixture's `yield` statement. But, for every fixture that has already run successfully for that test, pytest will still attempt to tear them down as it normally would.

### 2\. Adding finalizers directly

While yield fixtures are considered to be the cleaner and more straightforward option, there is another choice, and that is to add "finalizer" functions directly to the test's [request-context](#request-context) object. It brings a similar result as yield fixtures, but requires a bit more verbosity.

In order to use this approach, we have to request the [request-context](#request-context) object (just like we would request another fixture) in the fixture we need to add teardown code for, and then pass a callable, containing that teardown code, to its `addfinalizer` method.

We have to be careful though, because pytest will run that finalizer once it's been added, even if that fixture raises an exception after adding the finalizer. So to make sure we don't run the finalizer code when we wouldn't need to, we would only add the finalizer once the fixture would have done something that we'd need to teardown.

Here's how the previous example would look using the `addfinalizer` method:

`` `python     # content of test_emaillib.py     from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient      import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def mail_admin():         return MailAdminClient()       @pytest.fixture     def sending_user(mail_admin):         user = mail_admin.create_user()         yield user         mail_admin.delete_user(user)       @pytest.fixture     def receiving_user(mail_admin, request):         user = mail_admin.create_user()          def delete_user():             mail_admin.delete_user(user)          request.addfinalizer(delete_user)         return user       @pytest.fixture     def email(sending_user, receiving_user, request):         _email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")         sending_user.send_email(_email, receiving_user)          def empty_mailbox():             receiving_user.clear_mailbox()          request.addfinalizer(empty_mailbox)         return _email       def test_email_received(receiving_user, email):         assert email in receiving_user.inbox   It's a bit longer than yield fixtures and a bit more complex, but it ``\` does offer some nuances for when you're in a pinch.

Finalizers are executed in a first-in-last-out order. For yield fixtures, the first teardown code to run is from the right-most fixture, i.e. the last test parameter.

The fixture system of pytest is *very* powerful, but it's still being run by a computer, so it isn't able to figure out how to safely teardown everything we throw at it. If we aren't careful, an error in the wrong spot might leave stuff from our tests behind, and that can cause further issues pretty quickly.

For example, consider the following tests (based off of the mail example from above):

`` `python     # content of test_emaillib.py     from emaillib import Email, MailAdminClient      import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def setup():         mail_admin = MailAdminClient()         sending_user = mail_admin.create_user()         receiving_user = mail_admin.create_user()         email = Email(subject="Hey!", body="How's it going?")         sending_user.send_email(email, receiving_user)         yield receiving_user, email         receiving_user.clear_mailbox()         mail_admin.delete_user(sending_user)         mail_admin.delete_user(receiving_user)       def test_email_received(setup):         receiving_user, email = setup         assert email in receiving_user.inbox  This version is a lot more compact, but it's also harder to read, doesn't have a ``\` very descriptive fixture name, and none of the fixtures can be reused easily.

There's also a more serious issue, which is that if any of those steps in the setup raise an exception, none of the teardown code will run.

One option might be to go with the `addfinalizer` method instead of yield fixtures, but that might get pretty complex and difficult to maintain (and it wouldn't be compact anymore).

`` `pytest    $ pytest -q test_emaillib.py    .                                                                    [100%]    1 passed in 0.12s  .. _`safe fixture structure`:  Safe fixture structure ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The safest and simplest fixture structure requires limiting fixtures to only making one state-changing action each, and then bundling them together with their teardown code, as \[the email examples above \<yield fixtures\>\](\#the-email-examples-above-\<yield-fixtures\>) showed.

The chance that a state-changing operation can fail but still modify state is negligible, as most of these operations tend to be [transaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transaction_processing)-based (at least at the level of testing where state could be left behind). So if we make sure that any successful state-changing action gets torn down by moving it to a separate fixture function and separating it from other, potentially failing state-changing actions, then our tests will stand the best chance at leaving the test environment the way they found it.

For an example, let's say we have a website with a login page, and we have access to an admin API where we can generate users. For our test, we want to:

1.  Create a user through that admin API
2.  Launch a browser using Selenium
3.  Go to the login page of our site
4.  Log in as the user we created
5.  Assert that their name is in the header of the landing page

We wouldn't want to leave that user in the system, nor would we want to leave that browser session running, so we'll want to make sure the fixtures that create those things clean up after themselves.

Here's what that might look like:

\> **Note** \> For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. `base_url` and `admin_credentials`) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let's assume they exist, and we're just not looking at them.

`` `python     from uuid import uuid4     from urllib.parse import urljoin      from selenium.webdriver import Chrome     import pytest      from src.utils.pages import LoginPage, LandingPage     from src.utils import AdminApiClient     from src.utils.data_types import User       @pytest.fixture     def admin_client(base_url, admin_credentials):         return AdminApiClient(base_url, **admin_credentials)       @pytest.fixture     def user(admin_client):         _user = User(name="Susan", username=f"testuser-{uuid4()}", password="P4$$word")         admin_client.create_user(_user)         yield _user         admin_client.delete_user(_user)       @pytest.fixture     def driver():         _driver = Chrome()         yield _driver         _driver.quit()       @pytest.fixture     def login(driver, base_url, user):         driver.get(urljoin(base_url, "/login"))         page = LoginPage(driver)         page.login(user)       @pytest.fixture     def landing_page(driver, login):         return LandingPage(driver)       def test_name_on_landing_page_after_login(landing_page, user):         assert landing_page.header == f"Welcome, {user.name}!"  The way the dependencies are laid out means it's unclear if the ``user`  `<span class="title-ref"> fixture would execute before the </span><span class="title-ref">driver</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture. But that's ok, because those are atomic operations, and so it doesn't matter which one runs first because the sequence of events for the test is still \`linearizable \<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linearizability\></span>\_. But what *does* matter is that, no matter which one runs first, if the one raises an exception while the other would not have, neither will have left anything behind. If `driver` executes before `user`, and `user` raises an exception, the driver will still quit, and the user was never made. And if `driver` was the one to raise the exception, then the driver would never have been started and the user would never have been made.

## Running multiple `assert` statements safely

Sometimes you may want to run multiple asserts after doing all that setup, which makes sense as, in more complex systems, a single action can kick off multiple behaviors. pytest has a convenient way of handling this and it combines a bunch of what we've gone over so far.

All that's needed is stepping up to a larger scope, then having the **act** step defined as an autouse fixture, and finally, making sure all the fixtures are targeting that higher level scope.

Let's pull \[an example from above \<safe fixture structure\>\](\#an-example-from-above-\<safe-fixture-structure\>), and tweak it a bit. Let's say that in addition to checking for a welcome message in the header, we also want to check for a sign out button, and a link to the user's profile.

Let's take a look at how we can structure that so we can run multiple asserts without having to repeat all those steps again.

\> **Note** \> For this example, certain fixtures (i.e. `base_url` and `admin_credentials`) are implied to exist elsewhere. So for now, let's assume they exist, and we're just not looking at them.

`` `python     # contents of tests/end_to_end/test_login.py     from uuid import uuid4     from urllib.parse import urljoin      from selenium.webdriver import Chrome     import pytest      from src.utils.pages import LoginPage, LandingPage     from src.utils import AdminApiClient     from src.utils.data_types import User       @pytest.fixture(scope="class")     def admin_client(base_url, admin_credentials):         return AdminApiClient(base_url, **admin_credentials)       @pytest.fixture(scope="class")     def user(admin_client):         _user = User(name="Susan", username=f"testuser-{uuid4()}", password="P4$$word")         admin_client.create_user(_user)         yield _user         admin_client.delete_user(_user)       @pytest.fixture(scope="class")     def driver():         _driver = Chrome()         yield _driver         _driver.quit()       @pytest.fixture(scope="class")     def landing_page(driver, login):         return LandingPage(driver)       class TestLandingPageSuccess:         @pytest.fixture(scope="class", autouse=True)         def login(self, driver, base_url, user):             driver.get(urljoin(base_url, "/login"))             page = LoginPage(driver)             page.login(user)          def test_name_in_header(self, landing_page, user):             assert landing_page.header == f"Welcome, {user.name}!"          def test_sign_out_button(self, landing_page):             assert landing_page.sign_out_button.is_displayed()          def test_profile_link(self, landing_page, user):             profile_href = urljoin(base_url, f"/profile?id={user.profile_id}")             assert landing_page.profile_link.get_attribute("href") == profile_href  Notice that the methods are only referencing ``self`in the signature as a`<span class="title-ref"> formality. No state is tied to the actual test class as it might be in the </span><span class="title-ref">unittest.TestCase</span>\` framework. Everything is managed by the pytest fixture system.

Each method only has to request the fixtures that it actually needs without worrying about order. This is because the **act** fixture is an autouse fixture, and it made sure all the other fixtures executed before it. There's no more changes of state that need to take place, so the tests are free to make as many non-state-changing queries as they want without risking stepping on the toes of the other tests.

The `login` fixture is defined inside the class as well, because not every one of the other tests in the module will be expecting a successful login, and the **act** may need to be handled a little differently for another test class. For example, if we wanted to write another test scenario around submitting bad credentials, we could handle it by adding something like this to the test file:

`` `python     class TestLandingPageBadCredentials:         @pytest.fixture(scope="class")         def faux_user(self, user):             _user = deepcopy(user)             _user.password = "badpass"             return _user          def test_raises_bad_credentials_exception(self, login_page, faux_user):             with pytest.raises(BadCredentialsException):                 login_page.login(faux_user)   .. _`request-context`:  Fixtures can introspect the requesting test context ``\` -------------------------------------------------------------

Fixture functions can accept the :py\`request \<\_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest\><span class="title-ref"> object to introspect the "requesting" test function, class or module context. Further extending the previous </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span>\` fixture example, let's read an optional server URL from the test module which uses our fixture:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import smtplib      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="module")     def smtp_connection(request):         server = getattr(request.module, "smtpserver", "smtp.gmail.com")         smtp_connection = smtplib.SMTP(server, 587, timeout=5)         yield smtp_connection         print(f"finalizing {smtp_connection} ({server})")         smtp_connection.close()  We use the ``request.module`attribute to optionally obtain an`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">smtpserver</span>\` attribute from the test module. If we just execute again, nothing much has changed:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -s -q --tb=no test_module.py     FFfinalizing <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0002> (smtp.gmail.com)      ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_module.py::test_ehlo - assert 0     FAILED test_module.py::test_noop - assert 0     2 failed in 0.12s  Let's quickly create another test module that actually sets the ``\` server URL in its module namespace:

`` `python     # content of test_anothersmtp.py      smtpserver = "mail.python.org"  # will be read by smtp fixture       def test_showhelo(smtp_connection):         assert 0, smtp_connection.helo()  Running it:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -qq --tb=short test_anothersmtp.py     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ______________________________ test_showhelo _______________________________     test_anothersmtp.py:6: in test_showhelo         assert 0, smtp_connection.helo()     E   AssertionError: (250, b'mail.python.org')     E   assert 0     ------------------------- Captured stdout teardown -------------------------     finalizing <smtplib.SMTP object at 0xdeadbeef0003> (mail.python.org)     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_anothersmtp.py::test_showhelo - AssertionError: (250, b'mail....  voila! The ``smtp\_connection`fixture function picked up our mail server name`\` from the module namespace.

## Using markers to pass data to fixtures

Using the :py\`request \<\_pytest.fixtures.FixtureRequest\>\` object, a fixture can also access markers which are applied to a test function. This can be useful to pass data into a fixture from a test:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def fixt(request):         marker = request.node.get_closest_marker("fixt_data")         if marker is None:             # Handle missing marker in some way...             data = None         else:             data = marker.args[0]          # Do something with the data         return data       @pytest.mark.fixt_data(42)     def test_fixt(fixt):         assert fixt == 42  .. _`fixture-factory`:  Factories as fixtures ``\` -------------------------------------------------------------

The "factory as fixture" pattern can help in situations where the result of a fixture is needed multiple times in a single test. Instead of returning data directly, the fixture instead returns a function which generates the data. This function can then be called multiple times in the test.

Factories can have parameters as needed:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture     def make_customer_record():         def _make_customer_record(name):             return {"name": name, "orders": []}          return _make_customer_record       def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):         customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")         customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")         customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")  If the data created by the factory requires managing, the fixture can take care of that:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.fixture     def make_customer_record():         created_records = []          def _make_customer_record(name):             record = models.Customer(name=name, orders=[])             created_records.append(record)             return record          yield _make_customer_record          for record in created_records:             record.destroy()       def test_customer_records(make_customer_record):         customer_1 = make_customer_record("Lisa")         customer_2 = make_customer_record("Mike")         customer_3 = make_customer_record("Meredith")   .. _`fixture-parametrize`:  Parametrizing fixtures ``\` -----------------------------------------------------------------

Fixture functions can be parametrized in which case they will be called multiple times, each time executing the set of dependent tests, i.e. the tests that depend on this fixture. Test functions usually do not need to be aware of their re-running. Fixture parametrization helps to write exhaustive functional tests for components which themselves can be configured in multiple ways.

Extending the previous example, we can flag the fixture to create two `smtp_connection` fixture instances which will cause all tests using the fixture to run twice. The fixture function gets access to each parameter through the special :py\`request \<pytest.FixtureRequest\>\` object:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py     import smtplib      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="module", params=["smtp.gmail.com", "mail.python.org"])     def smtp_connection(request):         smtp_connection = smtplib.SMTP(request.param, 587, timeout=5)         yield smtp_connection         print(f"finalizing {smtp_connection}")         smtp_connection.close()  The main change is the declaration of ``params`with`<span class="title-ref"> :py</span>@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture\><span class="title-ref">, a list of values for each of which the fixture function will execute and can access a value via </span><span class="title-ref">request.param</span>\`. No test function code needs to change. So let's just do another run:

Note also, that with the </span><span class="title-ref">mail.python.org</span><span class="title-ref"> connection the second test fails in </span><span class="title-ref">test\_ehlo</span>\` because a different server string is expected than what arrived.

pytest will build a string that is the test ID for each fixture value in a parametrized fixture, e.g. `test_ehlo[smtp.gmail.com]` and `test_ehlo[mail.python.org]` in the above examples. These IDs can be used with `-k` to select specific cases to run, and they will also identify the specific case when one is failing. Running pytest with `--collect-only` will show the generated IDs.

Numbers, strings, booleans and `None` will have their usual string representation used in the test ID. For other objects, pytest will make a string based on the argument name. It is possible to customise the string used in a test ID for a certain fixture value by using the `ids` keyword argument:

`` `python    # content of test_ids.py    import pytest      @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1], ids=["spam", "ham"])    def a(request):        return request.param      def test_a(a):        pass      def idfn(fixture_value):        if fixture_value == 0:            return "eggs"        else:            return None      @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1], ids=idfn)    def b(request):        return request.param      def test_b(b):        pass  The above shows how ``ids`can be either a list of strings to use or`<span class="title-ref"> a function which will be called with the fixture value and then has to return a string to use. In the latter case if the function returns </span><span class="title-ref">None</span>\` then pytest's auto-generated ID will be used.

Running the above tests results in the following test IDs being used:

`` `python     # content of test_fixture_marks.py     import pytest       @pytest.fixture(params=[0, 1, pytest.param(2, marks=pytest.mark.skip)])     def data_set(request):         return request.param       def test_data(data_set):         pass  Running this test will *skip* the invocation of ``data\_set`with value`2``:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest test_fixture_marks.py -v     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 3 items      test_fixture_marks.py::test_data[0] PASSED                           [ 33%]     test_fixture_marks.py::test_data[1] PASSED                           [ 66%]     test_fixture_marks.py::test_data[2] SKIPPED (unconditional skip)     [100%]      ======================= 2 passed, 1 skipped in 0.12s =======================  .. _`interdependent fixtures`:  Modularity: using fixtures from a fixture function``\` ----------------------------------------------------------

In addition to using fixtures in test functions, fixture functions can use other fixtures themselves. This contributes to a modular design of your fixtures and allows reuse of framework-specific fixtures across many projects. As a simple example, we can extend the previous example and instantiate an object `app` where we stick the already defined `smtp_connection` resource into it:

`` `python     # content of test_appsetup.py      import pytest       class App:         def __init__(self, smtp_connection):             self.smtp_connection = smtp_connection       @pytest.fixture(scope="module")     def app(smtp_connection):         return App(smtp_connection)       def test_smtp_connection_exists(app):         assert app.smtp_connection  Here we declare an ``app`fixture which receives the previously defined`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture and instantiates an </span><span class="title-ref">App</span>\` object with it. Let's run it:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -v test_appsetup.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 2 items      test_appsetup.py::test_smtp_connection_exists[smtp.gmail.com] PASSED [ 50%]     test_appsetup.py::test_smtp_connection_exists[mail.python.org] PASSED [100%]      ============================ 2 passed in 0.12s =============================  Due to the parametrization of ``smtp\_connection`, the test will run twice with two`<span class="title-ref"> different </span><span class="title-ref">App</span><span class="title-ref"> instances and respective smtp servers. There is no need for the </span><span class="title-ref">app</span><span class="title-ref"> fixture to be aware of the </span><span class="title-ref">smtp\_connection</span>\` parametrization because pytest will fully analyse the fixture dependency graph.

Note that the `app` fixture has a scope of `module` and uses a module-scoped `smtp_connection` fixture. The example would still work if `smtp_connection` was cached on a `session` scope: it is fine for fixtures to use "broader" scoped fixtures but not the other way round: A session-scoped fixture could not use a module-scoped one in a meaningful way.

## Automatic grouping of tests by fixture instances

pytest minimizes the number of active fixtures during test runs. If you have a parametrized fixture, then all the tests using it will first execute with one instance and then finalizers are called before the next fixture instance is created. Among other things, this eases testing of applications which create and use global state.

The following example uses two parametrized fixtures, one of which is scoped on a per-module basis, and all the functions perform `print` calls to show the setup/teardown flow:

`` `python     # content of test_module.py     import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="module", params=["mod1", "mod2"])     def modarg(request):         param = request.param         print("  SETUP modarg", param)         yield param         print("  TEARDOWN modarg", param)       @pytest.fixture(scope="function", params=[1, 2])     def otherarg(request):         param = request.param         print("  SETUP otherarg", param)         yield param         print("  TEARDOWN otherarg", param)       def test_0(otherarg):         print("  RUN test0 with otherarg", otherarg)       def test_1(modarg):         print("  RUN test1 with modarg", modarg)       def test_2(otherarg, modarg):         print(f"  RUN test2 with otherarg {otherarg} and modarg {modarg}")   Let's run the tests in verbose mode and with looking at the print-output:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -v -s test_module.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y -- $PYTHON_PREFIX/bin/python     cachedir: .pytest_cache     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collecting ... collected 8 items      test_module.py::test_0[1]   SETUP otherarg 1       RUN test0 with otherarg 1     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 1      test_module.py::test_0[2]   SETUP otherarg 2       RUN test0 with otherarg 2     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 2      test_module.py::test_1[mod1]   SETUP modarg mod1       RUN test1 with modarg mod1     PASSED     test_module.py::test_2[mod1-1]   SETUP otherarg 1       RUN test2 with otherarg 1 and modarg mod1     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 1      test_module.py::test_2[mod1-2]   SETUP otherarg 2       RUN test2 with otherarg 2 and modarg mod1     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 2      test_module.py::test_1[mod2]   TEARDOWN modarg mod1       SETUP modarg mod2       RUN test1 with modarg mod2     PASSED     test_module.py::test_2[mod2-1]   SETUP otherarg 1       RUN test2 with otherarg 1 and modarg mod2     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 1      test_module.py::test_2[mod2-2]   SETUP otherarg 2       RUN test2 with otherarg 2 and modarg mod2     PASSED  TEARDOWN otherarg 2       TEARDOWN modarg mod2       ============================ 8 passed in 0.12s =============================  You can see that the parametrized module-scoped ``modarg`resource caused an`<span class="title-ref"> ordering of test execution that lead to the fewest possible "active" resources. The finalizer for the </span><span class="title-ref">mod1</span><span class="title-ref"> parametrized resource was executed before the </span><span class="title-ref">mod2</span>\` resource was setup.

In particular notice that test\_0 is completely independent and finishes first. Then test\_1 is executed with `mod1`, then test\_2 with `mod1`, then test\_1 with `mod2` and finally test\_2 with `mod2`.

The `otherarg` parametrized resource (having function scope) was set up before and teared down after every test that used it.

## Use fixtures in classes and modules with `usefixtures`

Sometimes test functions do not directly need access to a fixture object. For example, tests may require to operate with an empty directory as the current working directory but otherwise do not care for the concrete directory. Here is how you can use the standard `tempfile` and pytest fixtures to achieve it. We separate the creation of the fixture into a `conftest.py` file:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      import os     import tempfile      import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def cleandir():         with tempfile.TemporaryDirectory() as newpath:             old_cwd = os.getcwd()             os.chdir(newpath)             yield             os.chdir(old_cwd)  and declare its use in a test module via a ``usefixtures`marker:  .. code-block:: python      # content of test_setenv.py     import os      import pytest       @pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir")     class TestDirectoryInit:         def test_cwd_starts_empty(self):             assert os.listdir(os.getcwd()) == []             with open("myfile", "w", encoding="utf-8") as f:                 f.write("hello")          def test_cwd_again_starts_empty(self):             assert os.listdir(os.getcwd()) == []  Due to the`usefixtures`marker, the`cleandir`fixture`\` will be required for the execution of each test method, just as if you specified a "cleandir" function argument to each of them. Let's run it to verify our fixture is activated and the tests pass:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q     ..                                                                   [100%]     2 passed in 0.12s  You can specify multiple fixtures like this:  .. code-block:: python      @pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir", "anotherfixture")     def test(): ...  and you may specify fixture usage at the test module level using :globalvar:`pytestmark`:  .. code-block:: python      pytestmark = pytest.mark.usefixtures("cleandir")   It is also possible to put fixtures required by all tests in your project ``\` into an ini-file:

`` `ini     # content of pytest.ini     [pytest]     usefixtures = cleandir   > **Warning** >      Note this mark has no effect in **fixture functions**. For example,     this **will not work as expected**:      .. code-block:: python          @pytest.mark.usefixtures("my_other_fixture")         @pytest.fixture         def my_fixture_that_sadly_wont_use_my_other_fixture(): ...      This generates a deprecation warning, and will become an error in Pytest 8.  .. _`override fixtures`:  Overriding fixtures on various levels ``\` -------------------------------------

In relatively large test suite, you most likely need to `override` a `global` or `root` fixture with a `locally` defined one, keeping the test code readable and maintainable.

### Override a fixture on a folder (conftest) level

Given the tests file structure is:

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'
    
        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'username'
    
        subfolder/
            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subfolder/conftest.py
                import pytest
    
                @pytest.fixture
                def username(username):
                    return 'overridden-' + username
    
            test_something_else.py
                # content of tests/subfolder/test_something_else.py
                def test_username(username):
                    assert username == 'overridden-username'

As you can see, a fixture with the same name can be overridden for certain test folder level. Note that the `base` or `super` fixture can be accessed from the `overriding` fixture easily - used in the example above.

### Override a fixture on a test module level

Given the tests file structure is:

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'
    
        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def username(username):
                return 'overridden-' + username
    
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'overridden-username'
    
        test_something_else.py
            # content of tests/test_something_else.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def username(username):
                return 'overridden-else-' + username
    
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'overridden-else-username'

In the example above, a fixture with the same name can be overridden for certain test module.

### Override a fixture with direct test parametrization

Given the tests file structure is:

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def username():
                return 'username'
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def other_username(username):
                return 'other-' + username
    
        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.mark.parametrize('username', ['directly-overridden-username'])
            def test_username(username):
                assert username == 'directly-overridden-username'
    
            @pytest.mark.parametrize('username', ['directly-overridden-username-other'])
            def test_username_other(other_username):
                assert other_username == 'other-directly-overridden-username-other'

In the example above, a fixture value is overridden by the test parameter value. Note that the value of the fixture can be overridden this way even if the test doesn't use it directly (doesn't mention it in the function prototype).

### Override a parametrized fixture with non-parametrized one and vice versa

Given the tests file structure is:

    tests/
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture(params=['one', 'two', 'three'])
            def parametrized_username(request):
                return request.param
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def non_parametrized_username(request):
                return 'username'
    
        test_something.py
            # content of tests/test_something.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def parametrized_username():
                return 'overridden-username'
    
            @pytest.fixture(params=['one', 'two', 'three'])
            def non_parametrized_username(request):
                return request.param
    
            def test_username(parametrized_username):
                assert parametrized_username == 'overridden-username'
    
            def test_parametrized_username(non_parametrized_username):
                assert non_parametrized_username in ['one', 'two', 'three']
    
        test_something_else.py
            # content of tests/test_something_else.py
            def test_username(parametrized_username):
                assert parametrized_username in ['one', 'two', 'three']
    
            def test_username(non_parametrized_username):
                assert non_parametrized_username == 'username'

In the example above, a parametrized fixture is overridden with a non-parametrized version, and a non-parametrized fixture is overridden with a parametrized version for certain test module. The same applies for the test folder level obviously.

## Using fixtures from other projects

Usually projects that provide pytest support will use \[entry points \<pip-installable plugins\>\](\#entry-points-\<pip-installable-plugins\>), so just installing those projects into an environment will make those fixtures available for use.

In case you want to use fixtures from a project that does not use entry points, you can define `pytest_plugins` in your top `conftest.py` file to register that module as a plugin.

Suppose you have some fixtures in `mylibrary.fixtures` and you want to reuse them into your `app/tests` directory.

All you need to do is to define `pytest_plugins` in `app/tests/conftest.py` pointing to that module.

`` `python     pytest_plugins = "mylibrary.fixtures"  This effectively registers ``mylibrary.fixtures`as a plugin, making all its fixtures and`<span class="title-ref"> hooks available to tests in </span><span class="title-ref">app/tests</span>\`.

\> **Note** \> Sometimes users will *import* fixtures from other projects for use, however this is not recommended: importing fixtures into a module will register them in pytest as *defined* in that module.

This has minor consequences, such as appearing multiple times in `pytest --help`, but it is not **recommended** because this behavior might change/stop working in future versions.

# How to manage logging

pytest captures log messages of level `WARNING` or above automatically and displays them in their own section for each failed test in the same manner as captured stdout and stderr.

Running without options:

`` `bash     pytest  Shows failed tests like so:  .. code-block:: pytest      ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------     test_reporting.py    26 WARNING  text going to logger     ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------     text going to stdout     ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------     text going to stderr     ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================  By default each captured log message shows the module, line number, log level ``\` and message.

If desired the log and date format can be specified to anything that the logging module supports by passing specific formatting options:

`` `bash     pytest --log-format="%(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s" \             --log-date-format="%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"  Shows failed tests like so:  .. code-block:: pytest      ----------------------- Captured stdlog call ----------------------     2010-04-10 14:48:44 WARNING text going to logger     ----------------------- Captured stdout call ----------------------     text going to stdout     ----------------------- Captured stderr call ----------------------     text going to stderr     ==================== 2 failed in 0.02 seconds =====================  These options can also be customized through ``pytest.ini`file:  .. code-block:: ini      [pytest]     log_format = %(asctime)s %(levelname)s %(message)s     log_date_format = %Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S  Specific loggers can be disabled via`--log-disable={logger\_name}`.`\` This argument can be passed multiple times:

`` `bash     pytest --log-disable=main --log-disable=testing  Further it is possible to disable reporting of captured content (stdout, ``\` stderr and logs) on failed tests completely with:

`` `bash     pytest --show-capture=no   caplog fixture ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Inside tests it is possible to change the log level for the captured log messages. This is supported by the `caplog` fixture:

`` `python     def test_foo(caplog):         caplog.set_level(logging.INFO)  By default the level is set on the root logger, ``\` however as a convenience it is also possible to set the log level of any logger:

`` `python     def test_foo(caplog):         caplog.set_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger="root.baz")  The log levels set are restored automatically at the end of the test.  It is also possible to use a context manager to temporarily change the log ``<span class="title-ref"> level inside a </span><span class="title-ref">with</span>\` block:

`` `python     def test_bar(caplog):         with caplog.at_level(logging.INFO):             pass  Again, by default the level of the root logger is affected but the level of any ``\` logger can be changed instead with:

`` `python     def test_bar(caplog):         with caplog.at_level(logging.CRITICAL, logger="root.baz"):             pass  Lastly all the logs sent to the logger during the test run are made available on ``<span class="title-ref"> the fixture in the form of both the </span><span class="title-ref">logging.LogRecord</span>\` instances and the final log text. This is useful for when you want to assert on the contents of a message:

`` `python     def test_baz(caplog):         func_under_test()         for record in caplog.records:             assert record.levelname != "CRITICAL"         assert "wally" not in caplog.text  For all the available attributes of the log records see the ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">logging.LogRecord</span>\` class.

You can also resort to `record_tuples` if all you want to do is to ensure, that certain messages have been logged under a given logger name with a given severity and message:

`` `python     def test_foo(caplog):         logging.getLogger().info("boo %s", "arg")          assert caplog.record_tuples == [("root", logging.INFO, "boo arg")]  You can call ``caplog.clear()`to reset the captured log records in a test:  .. code-block:: python      def test_something_with_clearing_records(caplog):         some_method_that_creates_log_records()         caplog.clear()         your_test_method()         assert ["Foo"] == [rec.message for rec in caplog.records]   The`caplog.records`attribute contains records from the current stage only, so`<span class="title-ref"> inside the </span><span class="title-ref">setup</span><span class="title-ref"> phase it contains only setup logs, same with the </span><span class="title-ref">call</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">teardown</span>\` phases.

To access logs from other stages, use the `caplog.get_records(when)` method. As an example, if you want to make sure that tests which use a certain fixture never log any warnings, you can inspect the records for the `setup` and `call` stages during teardown like so:

`` `python     @pytest.fixture     def window(caplog):         window = create_window()         yield window         for when in ("setup", "call"):             messages = [                 x.message for x in caplog.get_records(when) if x.levelno == logging.WARNING             ]             if messages:                 pytest.fail(f"warning messages encountered during testing: {messages}")    The full API is available at `pytest.LogCaptureFixture`.  > **Warning** >      The ``caplog`fixture adds a handler to the root logger to capture logs. If the root logger is     modified during a test, for example with`logging.config.dictConfig`, this handler may be     removed and cause no logs to be captured. To avoid this, ensure that any root logger configuration     only adds to the existing handlers.   .. _live_logs:  Live Logs`\` ^^^^^^^^^

By setting the `log_cli` configuration option to `true`, pytest will output logging records as they are emitted directly into the console.

You can specify the logging level for which log records with equal or higher level are printed to the console by passing `--log-cli-level`. This setting accepts the logging level names or numeric values as seen in \[logging's documentation \<python:levels\>\](\#logging's-documentation-\<python:levels\>).

Additionally, you can also specify `--log-cli-format` and `--log-cli-date-format` which mirror and default to `--log-format` and `--log-date-format` if not provided, but are applied only to the console logging handler.

All of the CLI log options can also be set in the configuration INI file. The option names are:

  - `log_cli_level`
  - `log_cli_format`
  - `log_cli_date_format`

If you need to record the whole test suite logging calls to a file, you can pass `--log-file=/path/to/log/file`. This log file is opened in write mode by default which means that it will be overwritten at each run tests session. If you'd like the file opened in append mode instead, then you can pass `--log-file-mode=a`. Note that relative paths for the log-file location, whether passed on the CLI or declared in a config file, are always resolved relative to the current working directory.

You can also specify the logging level for the log file by passing `--log-file-level`. This setting accepts the logging level names or numeric values as seen in \[logging's documentation \<python:levels\>\](\#logging's-documentation-\<python:levels\>).

Additionally, you can also specify `--log-file-format` and `--log-file-date-format` which are equal to `--log-format` and `--log-date-format` but are applied to the log file logging handler.

All of the log file options can also be set in the configuration INI file. The option names are:

  - `log_file`
  - `log_file_mode`
  - `log_file_level`
  - `log_file_format`
  - `log_file_date_format`

You can call `set_log_path()` to customize the log\_file path dynamically. This functionality is considered **experimental**. Note that `set_log_path()` respects the `log_file_mode` option.

## Customizing Colors

Log levels are colored if colored terminal output is enabled. Changing from default colors or putting color on custom log levels is supported through `add_color_level()`. Example:

`` `python @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True) def pytest_configure(config):     logging_plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin("logging-plugin")      # Change color on existing log level     logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.INFO, "cyan")      # Add color to a custom log level (a custom log level `SPAM` is already set up)     logging_plugin.log_cli_handler.formatter.add_color_level(logging.SPAM, "blue") ``\` \> **Warning** \> This feature and its API are considered **experimental** and might change between releases without a deprecation notice. .. \_log\_release\_notes:

## Release notes

This feature was introduced as a drop-in replacement for the `pytest-catchlog` plugin and they conflict with each other. The backward compatibility API with `pytest-capturelog` has been dropped when this feature was introduced, so if for that reason you still need `pytest-catchlog` you can disable the internal feature by adding to your `pytest.ini`:

`` `ini    [pytest]        addopts=-p no:logging   .. _log_changes_3_4:  Incompatible changes in pytest 3.4 ``\` ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature was introduced in `3.3` and some **incompatible changes** have been made in `3.4` after community feedback:

  - Log levels are no longer changed unless explicitly requested by the `log_level` configuration or `--log-level` command-line options. This allows users to configure logger objects themselves. Setting `log_level` will set the level that is captured globally so if a specific test requires a lower level than this, use the `caplog.set_level()` functionality otherwise that test will be prone to failure.
  - \[Live Logs \<live\_logs\>\](\#live-logs-\<live\_logs\>) is now disabled by default and can be enabled setting the `log_cli` configuration option to `true`. When enabled, the verbosity is increased so logging for each test is visible.
  - \[Live Logs \<live\_logs\>\](\#live-logs-\<live\_logs\>) are now sent to `sys.stdout` and no longer require the `-s` command-line option to work.

If you want to partially restore the logging behavior of version `3.3`, you can add this options to your `ini` file:

`` `ini     [pytest]     log_cli=true     log_level=NOTSET  More details about the discussion that lead to this changes can be read in :issue:`3013`. ``\`

# How to mark test functions with attributes

By using the `pytest.mark` helper you can easily set metadata on your test functions. You can find the full list of builtin markers in the \[API Reference\<marks ref\>\](\#api-reference\<marks-ref\>). Or you can list all the markers, including builtin and custom, using the CLI - `pytest --markers`.

Here are some of the builtin markers:

  - \[usefixtures \<usefixtures\>\](\#usefixtures-\<usefixtures\>) - use fixtures on a test function or class
  - \[filterwarnings \<filterwarnings\>\](\#filterwarnings-\<filterwarnings\>) - filter certain warnings of a test function
  - \[skip \<skip\>\](\#skip-\<skip\>) - always skip a test function
  - \[skipif \<skipif\>\](\#skipif-\<skipif\>) - skip a test function if a certain condition is met
  - \[xfail \<xfail\>\](\#xfail-\<xfail\>) - produce an "expected failure" outcome if a certain condition is met
  - \[parametrize \<parametrizemark\>\](\#parametrize-\<parametrizemark\>) - perform multiple calls to the same test function.

It's easy to create custom markers or to apply markers to whole test classes or modules. Those markers can be used by plugins, and also are commonly used to \[select tests \<mark run\>\](\#select-tests-\<mark-run\>) on the command-line with the `-m` option.

See \[mark examples\](\#mark-examples) for examples which also serve as documentation.

\> **Note** \> Marks can only be applied to tests, having no effect on \[fixtures \<fixtures\>\](\#fixtures-\<fixtures\>).

## Registering marks

You can register custom marks in your `pytest.ini` file like this:

`` `ini     [pytest]     markers =         slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')         serial  or in your ``pyproject.toml`file like this:  .. code-block:: toml      [tool.pytest.ini_options]     markers = [         "slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m \"not slow\"')",         "serial",     ]  Note that everything past the`:`after the mark name is an optional description.  Alternatively, you can register new markers programmatically in a`\` \[pytest\_configure \<initialization-hooks\>\](\#pytest\_configure-\<initialization-hooks\>) hook:

`` `python     def pytest_configure(config):         config.addinivalue_line(             "markers", "env(name): mark test to run only on named environment"         )   Registered marks appear in pytest's help text and do not emit warnings (see the next section). It ``\` is recommended that third-party plugins always \[register their markers \<registering-markers\>\](\#register-their-markers-\<registering-markers\>).

## Raising errors on unknown marks

Unregistered marks applied with the `@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark` decorator will always emit a warning in order to avoid silently doing something surprising due to mistyped names. As described in the previous section, you can disable the warning for custom marks by registering them in your `pytest.ini` file or using a custom `pytest_configure` hook.

When the `--strict-markers` command-line flag is passed, any unknown marks applied with the `@pytest.mark.name_of_the_mark` decorator will trigger an error. You can enforce this validation in your project by adding `--strict-markers` to `addopts`:

`` `ini [pytest] addopts = --strict-markers markers =     slow: marks tests as slow (deselect with '-m "not slow"')     serial ``\`

# How to monkeypatch/mock modules and environments

<div class="currentmodule">

pytest

</div>

Sometimes tests need to invoke functionality which depends on global settings or which invokes code which cannot be easily tested such as network access. The `monkeypatch` fixture helps you to safely set/delete an attribute, dictionary item or environment variable, or to modify `sys.path` for importing.

The `monkeypatch` fixture provides these helper methods for safely patching and mocking functionality in tests:

  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.setattr(obj, name, value, raising=True) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.setattr\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.delattr(obj, name, raising=True) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.delattr\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.setitem(mapping, name, value) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.setitem\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.delitem(obj, name, raising=True) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.delitem\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.setenv(name, value, prepend=None) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.setenv\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.delenv(name, raising=True) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.delenv\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.syspath\_prepend(path) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.syspath\_prepend\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.chdir(path) \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.chdir\></span>
  - <span class="title-ref">monkeypatch.context() \<pytest.MonkeyPatch.context\></span>

All modifications will be undone after the requesting test function or fixture has finished. The `raising` parameter determines if a `KeyError` or `AttributeError` will be raised if the target of the set/deletion operation does not exist.

Consider the following scenarios:

1\. Modifying the behavior of a function or the property of a class for a test e.g. there is an API call or database connection you will not make for a test but you know what the expected output should be. Use :py\`monkeypatch.setattr \<MonkeyPatch.setattr\><span class="title-ref"> to patch the function or property with your desired testing behavior. This can include your own functions. Use :py\`monkeypatch.delattr \<MonkeyPatch.delattr\></span> to remove the function or property for the test.

2\. Modifying the values of dictionaries e.g. you have a global configuration that you want to modify for certain test cases. Use :py\`monkeypatch.setitem \<MonkeyPatch.setitem\><span class="title-ref"> to patch the dictionary for the test. :py\`monkeypatch.delitem \<MonkeyPatch.delitem\></span> can be used to remove items.

3\. Modifying environment variables for a test e.g. to test program behavior if an environment variable is missing, or to set multiple values to a known variable. :py\`monkeypatch.setenv \<MonkeyPatch.setenv\><span class="title-ref"> and :py\`monkeypatch.delenv \<MonkeyPatch.delenv\></span> can be used for these patches.

4\. Use `monkeypatch.setenv("PATH", value, prepend=os.pathsep)` to modify `$PATH`, and :py\`monkeypatch.chdir \<MonkeyPatch.chdir\>\` to change the context of the current working directory during a test.

5\. Use :py\`monkeypatch.syspath\_prepend \<MonkeyPatch.syspath\_prepend\><span class="title-ref"> to modify </span><span class="title-ref">sys.path</span><span class="title-ref"> which will also call </span><span class="title-ref">pkg\_resources.fixup\_namespace\_packages</span><span class="title-ref"> and :py\`importlib.invalidate\_caches</span>.

6\. Use :py\`monkeypatch.context \<MonkeyPatch.context\>\` to apply patches only in a specific scope, which can help control teardown of complex fixtures or patches to the stdlib.

See the [monkeypatch blog post](https://tetamap.wordpress.com//2009/03/03/monkeypatching-in-unit-tests-done-right/) for some introduction material and a discussion of its motivation.

## Monkeypatching functions

Consider a scenario where you are working with user directories. In the context of testing, you do not want your test to depend on the running user. `monkeypatch` can be used to patch functions dependent on the user to always return a specific value.

In this example, :py\`monkeypatch.setattr \<MonkeyPatch.setattr\><span class="title-ref"> is used to patch </span><span class="title-ref">Path.home</span><span class="title-ref"> so that the known testing path </span><span class="title-ref">Path("/abc")</span><span class="title-ref"> is always used when the test is run. This removes any dependency on the running user for testing purposes. :py\`monkeypatch.setattr \<MonkeyPatch.setattr\></span> must be called before the function which will use the patched function is called. After the test function finishes the `Path.home` modification will be undone.

`` `python     # contents of test_module.py with source code and the test     from pathlib import Path       def getssh():         """Simple function to return expanded homedir ssh path."""         return Path.home() / ".ssh"       def test_getssh(monkeypatch):         # mocked return function to replace Path.home         # always return '/abc'         def mockreturn():             return Path("/abc")          # Application of the monkeypatch to replace Path.home         # with the behavior of mockreturn defined above.         monkeypatch.setattr(Path, "home", mockreturn)          # Calling getssh() will use mockreturn in place of Path.home         # for this test with the monkeypatch.         x = getssh()         assert x == Path("/abc/.ssh")  Monkeypatching returned objects: building mock classes ``\` ------------------------------------------------------

:py\`monkeypatch.setattr \<MonkeyPatch.setattr\>\` can be used in conjunction with classes to mock returned objects from functions instead of values. Imagine a simple function to take an API url and return the json response.

`` `python     # contents of app.py, a simple API retrieval example     import requests       def get_json(url):         """Takes a URL, and returns the JSON."""         r = requests.get(url)         return r.json()  We need to mock ``r`, the returned response object for testing purposes.`<span class="title-ref"> The mock of </span><span class="title-ref">r</span><span class="title-ref"> needs a </span><span class="title-ref">.json()</span><span class="title-ref"> method which returns a dictionary. This can be done in our test file by defining a class to represent </span><span class="title-ref">r</span>\`.

`` `python     # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval     # import requests for the purposes of monkeypatching     import requests      # our app.py that includes the get_json() function     # this is the previous code block example     import app       # custom class to be the mock return value     # will override the requests.Response returned from requests.get     class MockResponse:         # mock json() method always returns a specific testing dictionary         @staticmethod         def json():             return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}       def test_get_json(monkeypatch):         # Any arguments may be passed and mock_get() will always return our         # mocked object, which only has the .json() method.         def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):             return MockResponse()          # apply the monkeypatch for requests.get to mock_get         monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)          # app.get_json, which contains requests.get, uses the monkeypatch         result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")         assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response" ``monkeypatch`applies the mock for`requests.get`with our`mock\_get`function.`<span class="title-ref"> The </span><span class="title-ref">mock\_get</span><span class="title-ref"> function returns an instance of the </span><span class="title-ref">MockResponse</span><span class="title-ref"> class, which has a </span><span class="title-ref">json()</span>\` method defined to return a known testing dictionary and does not require any outside API connection.

You can build the `MockResponse` class with the appropriate degree of complexity for the scenario you are testing. For instance, it could include an `ok` property that always returns `True`, or return different values from the `json()` mocked method based on input strings.

This mock can be shared across tests using a `fixture`:

`` `python     # contents of test_app.py, a simple test for our API retrieval     import pytest     import requests      # app.py that includes the get_json() function     import app       # custom class to be the mock return value of requests.get()     class MockResponse:         @staticmethod         def json():             return {"mock_key": "mock_response"}       # monkeypatched requests.get moved to a fixture     @pytest.fixture     def mock_response(monkeypatch):         """Requests.get() mocked to return {'mock_key':'mock_response'}."""          def mock_get(*args, **kwargs):             return MockResponse()          monkeypatch.setattr(requests, "get", mock_get)       # notice our test uses the custom fixture instead of monkeypatch directly     def test_get_json(mock_response):         result = app.get_json("https://fakeurl")         assert result["mock_key"] == "mock_response"   Furthermore, if the mock was designed to be applied to all tests, the ``fixture`could`<span class="title-ref"> be moved to a </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span><span class="title-ref"> file and use the with </span><span class="title-ref">autouse=True</span>\` option.

## Global patch example: preventing "requests" from remote operations

If you want to prevent the "requests" library from performing http requests in all your tests, you can do:

`` `python     # contents of conftest.py     import pytest       @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)     def no_requests(monkeypatch):         """Remove requests.sessions.Session.request for all tests."""         monkeypatch.delattr("requests.sessions.Session.request")  This autouse fixture will be executed for each test function and it ``<span class="title-ref"> will delete the method </span><span class="title-ref">request.session.Session.request</span>\` so that any attempts within tests to create http requests will fail.

\> **Note** \> Be advised that it is not recommended to patch builtin functions such as `open`, `compile`, etc., because it might break pytest's internals. If that's unavoidable, passing `--tb=native`, `--assert=plain` and `--capture=no` might help although there's no guarantee.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Mind that patching `stdlib` functions and some third-party libraries used by pytest might break pytest itself, therefore in those cases it is recommended to use <span class="title-ref">MonkeyPatch.context</span> to limit the patching to the block you want tested:

  - \`\`\`python  
    import functools
    
      - def test\_partial(monkeypatch):
        
          - with monkeypatch.context() as m:  
            m.setattr(functools, "partial", 3) assert functools.partial == 3

See `3290` for details.

</div>

Monkeypatching environment variables `` ` ------------------------------------  If you are working with environment variables you often need to safely change the values or delete them from the system for testing purposes. ``monkeypatch`provides a mechanism to do this using the`setenv`and`delenv`method. Our example code to test:`\`python \# contents of our original code file e.g. code.py import os

>   - def get\_os\_user\_lower():  
>     """Simple retrieval function. Returns lowercase USER or raises OSError.""" username = os.getenv("USER")
>     
>       - if username is None:  
>         raise OSError("USER environment is not set.")
>     
>     return username.lower()

There are two potential paths. First, the `USER` environment variable is set to a `` ` value. Second, the ``USER`environment variable does not exist. Using`monkeypatch`both paths can be safely tested without impacting the running environment:`\`python \# contents of our test file e.g. test\_code.py import pytest

>   - def test\_upper\_to\_lower(monkeypatch):  
>     """Set the USER env var to assert the behavior.""" monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser") assert get\_os\_user\_lower() == "testinguser"
> 
>   - def test\_raise\_exception(monkeypatch):  
>     """Remove the USER env var and assert OSError is raised.""" monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)
>     
>       - with pytest.raises(OSError):  
>         \_ = get\_os\_user\_lower()

This behavior can be moved into `fixture` structures and shared across tests:

``` python
# contents of our test file e.g. test_code.py
import pytest

@pytest.fixture
def mock_env_user(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.setenv("USER", "TestingUser")

@pytest.fixture
def mock_env_missing(monkeypatch):
    monkeypatch.delenv("USER", raising=False)

# notice the tests reference the fixtures for mocks
def test_upper_to_lower(mock_env_user):
    assert get_os_user_lower() == "testinguser"

def test_raise_exception(mock_env_missing):
    with pytest.raises(OSError):
        _ = get_os_user_lower()
```

Monkeypatching dictionaries `` ` ---------------------------  :py`monkeypatch.setitem <MonkeyPatch.setitem>` can be used to safely set the values of dictionaries to specific values during tests. Take this simplified connection string example: ``\`python \# contents of app.py to generate a simple connection string DEFAULT\_CONFIG = {"user": "user1", "database": "db1"}

>   - def create\_connection\_string(config=None):  
>     """Creates a connection string from input or defaults.""" config = config or DEFAULT\_CONFIG return f"User Id={config\['user'\]}; Location={config\['database'\]};"

For testing purposes we can patch the `DEFAULT_CONFIG` dictionary to specific values.

``` python
# contents of test_app.py
# app.py with the connection string function (prior code block)
import app

def test_connection(monkeypatch):
    # Patch the values of DEFAULT_CONFIG to specific
    # testing values only for this test.
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", "test_user")
    monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "database", "test_db")

    # expected result based on the mocks
    expected = "User Id=test_user; Location=test_db;"

    # the test uses the monkeypatched dictionary settings
    result = app.create_connection_string()
    assert result == expected
```

You can use the :py\`monkeypatch.delitem \<MonkeyPatch.delitem\>\` to remove values.

``` python
# contents of test_app.py
import pytest

# app.py with the connection string function
import app

def test_missing_user(monkeypatch):
    # patch the DEFAULT_CONFIG t be missing the 'user' key
    monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)

    # Key error expected because a config is not passed, and the
    # default is now missing the 'user' entry.
    with pytest.raises(KeyError):
        _ = app.create_connection_string()
```

The modularity of fixtures gives you the flexibility to define `` ` separate fixtures for each potential mock and reference them in the needed tests. ``\`python \# contents of test\_app.py import pytest

> \# app.py with the connection string function import app
> 
> \# all of the mocks are moved into separated fixtures @pytest.fixture def mock\_test\_user(monkeypatch): """Set the DEFAULT\_CONFIG user to test\_user.""" monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT\_CONFIG, "user", "test\_user")
> 
> @pytest.fixture def mock\_test\_database(monkeypatch): """Set the DEFAULT\_CONFIG database to test\_db.""" monkeypatch.setitem(app.DEFAULT\_CONFIG, "database", "test\_db")
> 
> @pytest.fixture def mock\_missing\_default\_user(monkeypatch): """Remove the user key from DEFAULT\_CONFIG""" monkeypatch.delitem(app.DEFAULT\_CONFIG, "user", raising=False)
> 
> \# tests reference only the fixture mocks that are needed def test\_connection(mock\_test\_user, mock\_test\_database): expected = "User Id=test\_user; Location=test\_db;"
> 
> > result = app.create\_connection\_string() assert result == expected
> 
>   - def test\_missing\_user(mock\_missing\_default\_user):
>     
>       - with pytest.raises(KeyError):

# Managing pytest's output

## Modifying Python traceback printing

Examples for modifying traceback printing:

`` `bash     pytest --showlocals     # show local variables in tracebacks     pytest -l               # show local variables (shortcut)     pytest --no-showlocals  # hide local variables (if addopts enables them)      pytest --capture=fd  # default, capture at the file descriptor level     pytest --capture=sys # capture at the sys level     pytest --capture=no  # don't capture     pytest -s            # don't capture (shortcut)     pytest --capture=tee-sys # capture to logs but also output to sys level streams      pytest --tb=auto    # (default) 'long' tracebacks for the first and last                          # entry, but 'short' style for the other entries     pytest --tb=long    # exhaustive, informative traceback formatting     pytest --tb=short   # shorter traceback format     pytest --tb=line    # only one line per failure     pytest --tb=native  # Python standard library formatting     pytest --tb=no      # no traceback at all  The ``--full-trace`causes very long traces to be printed on error (longer`<span class="title-ref"> than </span><span class="title-ref">--tb=long</span>\`). It also ensures that a stack trace is printed on **KeyboardInterrupt** (Ctrl+C). This is very useful if the tests are taking too long and you interrupt them with Ctrl+C to find out where the tests are *hanging*. By default no output will be shown (because KeyboardInterrupt is caught by pytest). By using this option you make sure a trace is shown.

## Verbosity

Examples for modifying printing verbosity:

Notice now that:

\* Each test inside the file gets its own line in the output. `` ` * ``test\_words\_fail`gives the same output as before in this case. *`test\_numbers\_fail`now shows a full text diff of the two dictionaries. *`test\_long\_text\_fail`also doesn't truncate on the right hand side as before, but now pytest won't truncate any   text at all, regardless of its size.  Those were examples of how verbosity affects normal test session output, but verbosity also is used in other situations, for example you are shown even fixtures that start with`\_`if you use`pytest --fixtures -v`.  Using higher verbosity levels (`-vvv`,`-vvvv``, ...) is supported, but has no effect in pytest itself at the moment, however some plugins might make use of higher verbosity.  .. _`pytest.fine_grained_verbosity`:  Fine-grained verbosity ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  In addition to specifying the application wide verbosity level, it is possible to control specific aspects independently. This is done by setting a verbosity level in the configuration file for the specific aspect of the output.  :confval:`verbosity_assertions`: Controls how verbose the assertion output should be when pytest is executed. Running``pytest --no-header`with a value of`2``would have the same output as the previous example, but each test inside the file is shown by a single character in the output.  :confval:`verbosity_test_cases`: Controls how verbose the test execution output should be when pytest is executed. Running``pytest --no-header`with a value of`2``would have the same output as the first verbosity example, but each test inside the file gets its own line in the output.  .. _`pytest.detailed_failed_tests_usage`:  Producing a detailed summary report --------------------------------------------------  The``-r`flag can be used to display a "short test summary info" at the end of the test session, making it easy in large test suites to get a clear picture of all failures, skips, xfails, etc.  It defaults to`fE`to list failures and errors.  .. regendoc:wipe  Example:`\`python \# content of test\_example.py import pytest

<div id="truncation-params">

Modifying truncation limits `` ` --------------------------------------------------  .. versionadded: 8.4  Default truncation limits are 8 lines or 640 characters, whichever comes first. To set custom truncation limits you can use following ``pytest.ini`file options:`\`ini \[pytest\] truncation\_limit\_lines = 10 truncation\_limit\_chars = 90

</div>

That will cause pytest to truncate the assertions to 10 lines or 90 characters, whichever comes first.

Setting both `truncation_limit_lines` and `truncation_limit_chars` to `0` will disable the truncation. `` ` However, setting only one of those values will disable one truncation mode, but will leave the other one intact.  Creating resultlog format files --------------------------------------------------  To create plain-text machine-readable result files you can issue: ``\`bash pytest --resultlog=path

and look at the content at the `path` location. Such files are used e.g. `` ` by the `PyPy-test`_ web page to show test results over several revisions.  > **Warning** >      This option is rarely used and is scheduled for removal in pytest 6.0.      If you use this option, consider using the new `pytest-reportlog <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-reportlog>`__ plugin instead.      See [the deprecation docs <resultlog deprecated>](#the-deprecation-docs-<resultlog-deprecated>) for more information.      Creating JUnitXML format files ----------------------------------------------------  To create result files which can be read by Jenkins_ or other Continuous integration servers, use this invocation: ``\`bash pytest --junit-xml=path

to create an XML file at `path`.

To set the name of the root test suite xml item, you can configure the `junit_suite_name` option in your config file:

``` ini
[pytest]
junit_suite_name = my_suite
```

<div class="versionadded">

4.0

</div>

JUnit XML specification seems to indicate that `"time"` attribute `` ` should report total test execution times, including setup and teardown (`1 <http://windyroad.com.au/dl/Open%20Source/JUnit.xsd>`_, `2 <https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/en/SSQ2R2_14.1.0/com.ibm.rsar.analysis.codereview.cobol.doc/topics/cac_useresults_junit.html>`_). It is the default pytest behavior. To report just call durations instead, configure the ``junit\_duration\_report`option like this:`\`ini \[pytest\] junit\_duration\_report = call

<div id="record_property example">

record\_property `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If you want to log additional information for a test, you can use the ``record\_property`fixture:`\`python def test\_function(record\_property): record\_property("example\_key", 1) assert True

</div>

This will add an extra property `example_key="1"` to the generated `` ` ``testcase`tag:`\`xml \<testcase classname="test\_function" file="test\_function.py" line="0" name="test\_function" time="0.0009"\> \<properties\> \<property name="example\_key" value="1" /\> \</properties\> \</testcase\>

Alternatively, you can integrate this functionality with custom markers:

``` python
# content of conftest.py

def pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items):
    for item in items:
        for marker in item.iter_markers(name="test_id"):
            test_id = marker.args[0]
            item.user_properties.append(("test_id", test_id))
```

And in your tests:

``` python
# content of test_function.py
import pytest

@pytest.mark.test_id(1501)
def test_function():
    assert True
```

Will result in:

``` xml
<testcase classname="test_function" file="test_function.py" line="0" name="test_function" time="0.0009">
  <properties>
    <property name="test_id" value="1501" />
  </properties>
</testcase>
```

\> **Warning** \> Please note that using this feature will break schema verifications for the latest JUnitXML schema. This might be a problem when used with some CI servers.

record\_xml\_attribute `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  To add an additional xml attribute to a testcase element, you can use ``record\_xml\_attribute`fixture. This can also be used to override existing values:`\`python def test\_function(record\_xml\_attribute): record\_xml\_attribute("assertions", "REQ-1234") record\_xml\_attribute("classname", "custom\_classname") print("hello world") assert True

Unlike `record_property`, this will not add a new child element. `` ` Instead, this will add an attribute ``assertions="REQ-1234"`inside the generated`testcase`tag and override the default`classname`with`"classname=custom\_classname"`:`\`xml \<testcase classname="custom\_classname" file="test\_function.py" line="0" name="test\_function" time="0.003" assertions="REQ-1234"\> \<system-out\> hello world \</system-out\> \</testcase\>

\> **Warning** \> `record_xml_attribute` is an experimental feature, and its interface might be replaced by something more powerful and general in future versions. The functionality per-se will be kept, however.

> Using this over `record_xml_property` can help when using ci tools to parse the xml report. However, some parsers are quite strict about the elements and attributes that are allowed. Many tools use an xsd schema (like the example below) to validate incoming xml. Make sure you are using attribute names that are allowed by your parser.

# How to parametrize fixtures and test functions<span id="parametrize"></span><span id="parametrized test functions"></span><span id="parametrizing-tests"></span><span id="test generators"></span>

pytest enables test parametrization at several levels:

  - \- :py\`pytest.fixture\` allows one to \[parametrize fixture  
    functions \<fixture-parametrize\>\](\#parametrize-fixture

\--functions-\<fixture-parametrize\>).

  - [@pytest.mark.parametrize](#@pytest.mark.parametrize) allows one to define multiple sets of arguments and fixtures at the test function or class.
  - [pytest\_generate\_tests](#pytest_generate_tests) allows one to define custom parametrization schemes or extensions.

## `@pytest.mark.parametrize`: parametrizing test functions<span id="parametrizemark"></span>

The builtin \[pytest.mark.parametrize ref\](\#pytest.mark.parametrize-ref) decorator enables parametrization of arguments for a test function. Here is a typical example of a test function that implements checking that a certain input leads to an expected output:

`` `python     # content of test_expectation.py     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), ("6*9", 42)])     def test_eval(test_input, expected):         assert eval(test_input) == expected  Here, the ``@parametrize`decorator defines three different`(test\_input,expected)`  `<span class="title-ref"> tuples so that the </span><span class="title-ref">test\_eval</span>\` function will run three times using them in turn:

`` `pytest     $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 3 items      test_expectation.py ..F                                              [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ____________________________ test_eval[6*9-42] _____________________________      test_input = '6*9', expected = 42          @pytest.mark.parametrize("test_input,expected", [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), ("6*9", 42)])         def test_eval(test_input, expected):     >       assert eval(test_input) == expected     E       AssertionError: assert 54 == 42     E        +  where 54 = eval('6*9')      test_expectation.py:6: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_expectation.py::test_eval[6*9-42] - AssertionError: assert 54...     ======================= 1 failed, 2 passed in 0.12s ========================  > **Note** >      Parameter values are passed as-is to tests (no copy whatsoever).      For example, if you pass a list or a dict as a parameter value, and     the test case code mutates it, the mutations will be reflected in subsequent     test case calls.  .. note::      pytest by default escapes any non-ascii characters used in unicode strings     for the parametrization because it has several downsides.     If however you would like to use unicode strings in parametrization     and see them in the terminal as is (non-escaped), use this option     in your ``pytest.ini`:      .. code-block:: ini          [pytest]         disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support = True      Keep in mind however that this might cause unwanted side effects and     even bugs depending on the OS used and plugins currently installed,     so use it at your own risk.   As designed in this example, only one pair of input/output values fails`<span class="title-ref"> the simple test function. And as usual with test function arguments, you can see the </span><span class="title-ref">input</span><span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">output</span>\` values in the traceback.

Note that you could also use the parametrize marker on a class or a module (see \[mark\](\#mark)) which would invoke several functions with the argument sets, for instance:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize("n,expected", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])     class TestClass:         def test_simple_case(self, n, expected):             assert n + 1 == expected          def test_weird_simple_case(self, n, expected):             assert (n * 1) + 1 == expected   To parametrize all tests in a module, you can assign to the :globalvar:`pytestmark` global variable:   .. code-block:: python      import pytest      pytestmark = pytest.mark.parametrize("n,expected", [(1, 2), (3, 4)])       class TestClass:         def test_simple_case(self, n, expected):             assert n + 1 == expected          def test_weird_simple_case(self, n, expected):             assert (n * 1) + 1 == expected   It is also possible to mark individual test instances within parametrize, ``<span class="title-ref"> for example with the builtin </span><span class="title-ref">mark.xfail</span>\`:

`` `python     # content of test_expectation.py     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "test_input,expected",         [("3+5", 8), ("2+4", 6), pytest.param("6*9", 42, marks=pytest.mark.xfail)],     )     def test_eval(test_input, expected):         assert eval(test_input) == expected  Let's run this:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 3 items      test_expectation.py ..x                                              [100%]      ======================= 2 passed, 1 xfailed in 0.12s =======================  The one parameter set which caused a failure previously now ``\` shows up as an "xfailed" (expected to fail) test.

In case the values provided to `parametrize` result in an empty list - for example, if they're dynamically generated by some function - the behaviour of pytest is defined by the `empty_parameter_set_mark` option.

To get all combinations of multiple parametrized arguments you can stack `parametrize` decorators:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.mark.parametrize("x", [0, 1])     @pytest.mark.parametrize("y", [2, 3])     def test_foo(x, y):         pass  This will run the test with the arguments set to ``x=0/y=2`,`x=1/y=2`,`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">x=0/y=3</span><span class="title-ref">, and </span><span class="title-ref">x=1/y=3</span>\` exhausting parameters in the order of the decorators.

## Basic `pytest_generate_tests` example

Sometimes you may want to implement your own parametrization scheme or implement some dynamism for determining the parameters or scope of a fixture. For this, you can use the `pytest_generate_tests` hook which is called when collecting a test function. Through the passed in `metafunc` object you can inspect the requesting test context and, most importantly, you can call `metafunc.parametrize()` to cause parametrization.

For example, let's say we want to run a test taking string inputs which we want to set via a new `pytest` command line option. Let's first write a simple test accepting a `stringinput` fixture function argument:

`` `python     # content of test_strings.py       def test_valid_string(stringinput):         assert stringinput.isalpha()  Now we add a ``conftest.py`file containing the addition of a`\` command line option and the parametrization of our test function:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py       def pytest_addoption(parser):         parser.addoption(             "--stringinput",             action="append",             default=[],             help="list of stringinputs to pass to test functions",         )       def pytest_generate_tests(metafunc):         if "stringinput" in metafunc.fixturenames:             metafunc.parametrize("stringinput", metafunc.config.getoption("stringinput"))  If we now pass two stringinput values, our test will run twice:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q --stringinput="hello" --stringinput="world" test_strings.py     ..                                                                   [100%]     2 passed in 0.12s  Let's also run with a stringinput that will lead to a failing test:  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest -q --stringinput="!" test_strings.py     F                                                                    [100%]     ================================= FAILURES =================================     ___________________________ test_valid_string[!] ___________________________      stringinput = '!'          def test_valid_string(stringinput):     >       assert stringinput.isalpha()     E       AssertionError: assert False     E        +  where False = <built-in method isalpha of str object at 0xdeadbeef0001>()     E        +    where <built-in method isalpha of str object at 0xdeadbeef0001> = '!'.isalpha      test_strings.py:4: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_strings.py::test_valid_string[!] - AssertionError: assert False     1 failed in 0.12s  As expected our test function fails.  If you don't specify a stringinput it will be skipped because ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">metafunc.parametrize()</span>\` will be called with an empty parameter list:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q -rs test_strings.py     s                                                                    [100%]     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     SKIPPED [1] test_strings.py: got empty parameter set ['stringinput'], function test_valid_string at /home/sweet/project/test_strings.py:2     1 skipped in 0.12s  Note that when calling ``metafunc.parametrize`multiple times with different parameter sets, all parameter names across`\` those sets cannot be duplicated, otherwise an error will be raised.

# How to install and use plugins<span id="extplugins"></span><span id="external plugins"></span>

This section talks about installing and using third party plugins. For writing your own plugins, please refer to \[writing-plugins\](\#writing-plugins).

Installing a third party plugin can be easily done with `pip`:

`` `bash     pip install pytest-NAME     pip uninstall pytest-NAME  If a plugin is installed, ``pytest`automatically finds and integrates it,`\` there is no need to activate it.

Here is a little annotated list for some popular plugins:

  - `pytest-django`: write tests for [django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/) apps, using pytest integration.
  - `pytest-twisted`: write tests for [twisted](https://twistedmatrix.com/) apps, starting a reactor and processing deferreds from test functions.
  - `pytest-cov`: coverage reporting, compatible with distributed testing
  - `pytest-xdist`: to distribute tests to CPUs and remote hosts, to run in boxed mode which allows to survive segmentation faults, to run in looponfailing mode, automatically re-running failing tests on file changes.
  - `pytest-instafail`: to report failures while the test run is happening.
  - `pytest-bdd`: to write tests using behaviour-driven testing.
  - `pytest-timeout`: to timeout tests based on function marks or global definitions.
  - `pytest-pep8`: a `--pep8` option to enable PEP8 compliance checking.
  - `pytest-flakes`: check source code with pyflakes.
  - `allure-pytest`: report test results via [allure-framework](https://github.com/allure-framework/).

To see a complete list of all plugins with their latest testing status against different pytest and Python versions, please visit \[plugin-list\](\#plugin-list).

You may also discover more plugins through a [pytest- pypi.org search](https://pypi.org/search/?q=pytest-).

## Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file

You can require plugins in a test module or a conftest file using `pytest_plugins`:

`` `python     pytest_plugins = ("myapp.testsupport.myplugin",)  When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins ``\` will be loaded as well.

\> **Note** \> Requiring plugins using a `pytest_plugins` variable in non-root `conftest.py` files is deprecated. See \[full explanation \<requiring plugins in non-root conftests\>\](\#full-explanation-\<requiring-plugins-in-non-root-conftests\>) in the Writing plugins section.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The name `pytest_plugins` is reserved and should not be used as a name for a custom plugin module.

</div>

## Finding out which plugins are active

If you want to find out which plugins are active in your environment you can type:

`` `bash     pytest --trace-config  and will get an extended test header which shows activated plugins ``\` and their names. It will also print local plugins aka \[conftest.py \<conftest.py plugins\>\](\#conftest.py-\<conftest.py-plugins\>) files when they are loaded.

## Deactivating / unregistering a plugin by name

You can prevent plugins from loading or unregister them:

`` `bash     pytest -p no:NAME  This means that any subsequent try to activate/load the named ``\` plugin will not work.

If you want to unconditionally disable a plugin for a project, you can add this option to your `pytest.ini` file:

`` `ini       [pytest]       addopts = -p no:NAME  Alternatively to disable it only in certain environments (for example in a ``<span class="title-ref"> CI server), you can set </span><span class="title-ref">PYTEST\_ADDOPTS</span><span class="title-ref"> environment variable to </span><span class="title-ref">-p no:name</span>\`.

See \[findpluginname\](\#findpluginname) for how to obtain the name of a plugin.

# How to use skip and xfail to deal with tests that cannot succeed<span id="skip and xfail"></span>

You can mark test functions that cannot be run on certain platforms or that you expect to fail so pytest can deal with them accordingly and present a summary of the test session, while keeping the test suite *green*.

A **skip** means that you expect your test to pass only if some conditions are met, otherwise pytest should skip running the test altogether. Common examples are skipping windows-only tests on non-windows platforms, or skipping tests that depend on an external resource which is not available at the moment (for example a database).

An **xfail** means that you expect a test to fail for some reason. A common example is a test for a feature not yet implemented, or a bug not yet fixed. When a test passes despite being expected to fail (marked with `pytest.mark.xfail`), it's an **xpass** and will be reported in the test summary.

`pytest` counts and lists *skip* and *xfail* tests separately. Detailed information about skipped/xfailed tests is not shown by default to avoid cluttering the output. You can use the `-r` option to see details corresponding to the "short" letters shown in the test progress:

  - `` `bash     pytest -rxXs  # show extra info on xfailed, xpassed, and skipped tests  More details on the ``-r`option can be found by running`pytest -h``.  (See [how to change command line options defaults](#how-to-change-command-line-options-defaults))    .. _skip: .. _`condition booleans`:  Skipping test functions -----------------------    The simplest way to skip a test function is to mark it with the``skip`decorator which may be passed an optional`reason`:`\`python  
    @pytest.mark.skip(reason="no way of currently testing this") def test\_the\_unknown(): ...

Alternatively, it is also possible to skip imperatively during test execution or setup `` ` by calling the ``pytest.skip(reason)`function:`\`python def test\_function(): if not valid\_config(): pytest.skip("unsupported configuration")

The imperative method is useful when it is not possible to evaluate the skip condition `` ` during import time.  It is also possible to skip the whole module using ``pytest.skip(reason, allow\_module\_level=True)`at the module level:`\`python import sys

> import pytest
> 
>   - if not sys.platform.startswith("win"):  
>     pytest.skip("skipping windows-only tests", allow\_module\_level=True)

**Reference**: \[pytest.mark.skip ref\](\#pytest.mark.skip-ref)

`skipif` `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~    If you wish to skip something conditionally then you can use ``skipif`instead. Here is an example of marking a test function to be skipped when run on an interpreter earlier than Python3.10:`\`python import sys

> @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.version\_info \< (3, 10), reason="requires python3.10 or higher") def test\_function(): ...

If the condition evaluates to `True` during collection, the test function will be skipped, `` ` with the specified reason appearing in the summary when using ``-rs`.  You can share`skipif`markers between modules.  Consider this test module:`\`python \# content of test\_mymodule.py import mymodule

>   - minversion = pytest.mark.skipif(  
>     mymodule.\_\_versioninfo\_\_ \< (1, 1), reason="at least mymodule-1.1 required"
> 
> )
> 
> @minversion def test\_function(): ...

You can import the marker and reuse it in another test module:

``` python
# test_myothermodule.py
from test_mymodule import minversion

@minversion
def test_anotherfunction(): ...
```

For larger test suites it's usually a good idea to have one file `` ` where you define the markers which you then consistently apply throughout your test suite.  Alternatively, you can use [condition strings <string conditions>](#condition-strings <string-conditions>) instead of booleans, but they can't be shared between modules easily so they are supported mainly for backward compatibility reasons.  **Reference**: [pytest.mark.skipif ref](#pytest.mark.skipif-ref)   Skip all test functions of a class or module ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You can use the ``skipif`marker (as any other marker) on classes:`\`python @pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32", reason="does not run on windows") class TestPosixCalls: def test\_function(self): "will not be setup or run under 'win32' platform"

If the condition is `True`, this marker will produce a skip result for `` ` each of the test methods of that class.  If you want to skip all test functions of a module, you may use the :globalvar:`pytestmark` global: ``\`python \# test\_module.py pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(...)

If multiple `skipif` decorators are applied to a test function, it `` ` will be skipped if any of the skip conditions is true.     Skipping files or directories ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Sometimes you may need to skip an entire file or directory, for example if the tests rely on Python version-specific features or contain code that you do not wish pytest to run. In this case, you must exclude the files and directories from collection. Refer to [customizing-test-collection](#customizing-test-collection) for more information.   Skipping on a missing import dependency ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You can skip tests on a missing import by using [pytest.importorskip ref](#pytest.importorskip-ref) at module level, within a test, or test setup function. ``\`python docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils")

If `docutils` cannot be imported here, this will lead to a skip outcome of `` ` the test. You can also skip based on the version number of a library: ``\`python docutils = pytest.importorskip("docutils", minversion="0.3")

The version will be read from the specified `` ` module's ``\_\_version\_\_`attribute.  Summary ~~~~~~~  Here's a quick guide on how to skip tests in a module in different situations:  1. Skip all tests in a module unconditionally:`\`python pytestmark = pytest.mark.skip("all tests still WIP")

2.  Skip all tests in a module based on some condition:

> 
> 
> ``` python
> pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(sys.platform == "win32", reason="tests for linux only")
> ```

3.  Skip all tests in a module if some import is missing:

> 
> 
> ``` python
> pexpect = pytest.importorskip("pexpect")
> ```

<div id="xfail">

XFail: mark test functions as expected to fail `` ` ----------------------------------------------  You can use the ``xfail`marker to indicate that you expect a test to fail:`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail def test\_function(): ...

</div>

This test will run but no traceback will be reported when it fails. Instead, terminal `` ` reporting will list it in the "expected to fail" ( ``XFAIL`) or "unexpectedly passing" (`XPASS`) sections.  Alternatively, you can also mark a test as`XFAIL`from within the test or its setup function imperatively:`\`python def test\_function(): if not valid\_config(): pytest.xfail("failing configuration (but should work)")

``` python
def test_function2():
    import slow_module

    if slow_module.slow_function():
        pytest.xfail("slow_module taking too long")
```

These two examples illustrate situations where you don't want to check for a condition `` ` at the module level, which is when a condition would otherwise be evaluated for marks.  This will make ``test\_function`  `XFAIL``. Note that no other code is executed after the `pytest.xfail` call, differently from the marker. That's because it is implemented internally by raising a known exception.  **Reference**: [pytest.mark.xfail ref](#pytest.mark.xfail-ref)``condition`parameter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If a test is only expected to fail under a certain condition, you can pass that condition as the first parameter:`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail(sys.platform == "win32", reason="bug in a 3rd party library") def test\_function(): ...

Note that you have to pass a reason as well (see the parameter description at `` ` [pytest.mark.xfail ref](#pytest.mark.xfail-ref)). ``reason`parameter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  You can specify the motive of an expected failure with the`reason`parameter:`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail(reason="known parser issue") def test\_function(): ...

`raises` parameter `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If you want to be more specific as to why the test is failing, you can specify a single exception, or a tuple of exceptions, in the ``raises`argument.`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail(raises=RuntimeError) def test\_function(): ...

Then the test will be reported as a regular failure if it fails with an `` ` exception not mentioned in ``raises`.`run`parameter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  If a test should be marked as xfail and reported as such but should not be even executed, use the`run`parameter as`False`:`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail(run=False) def test\_function(): ...

This is specially useful for xfailing tests that are crashing the interpreter and should be `` ` investigated later.  .. _`xfail strict tutorial`: ``strict`parameter ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Both`XFAIL`and`XPASS`don't fail the test suite by default. You can change this by setting the`strict`keyword-only parameter to`True`:`\`python @pytest.mark.xfail(strict=True) def test\_function(): ...

This will make `XPASS` ("unexpectedly passing") results from this test to fail the test suite.

You can change the default value of the `strict` parameter using the `` ` ``xfail\_strict`ini option:`\`ini \[pytest\] xfail\_strict=true

Ignoring xfail `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  By specifying on the commandline: ``\`bash pytest --runxfail

you can force the running and reporting of an `xfail` marked test `` ` as if it weren't marked at all. This also causes `pytest.xfail` to produce no effect.  Examples ~~~~~~~~  Here is a simple test file with the several usages:  .. literalinclude:: /example/xfail_demo.py  Running it with the report-on-xfail option gives this output:  ..

# How to use temporary directories and files in tests<span id="tmp_path handling"></span>

## The `tmp_path` fixture

You can use the `tmp_path` fixture which will provide a temporary directory unique to each test function.

`tmp_path` is a <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path</span> object. Here is an example test usage:

`` `python     # content of test_tmp_path.py     CONTENT = "content"       def test_create_file(tmp_path):         d = tmp_path / "sub"         d.mkdir()         p = d / "hello.txt"         p.write_text(CONTENT, encoding="utf-8")         assert p.read_text(encoding="utf-8") == CONTENT         assert len(list(tmp_path.iterdir())) == 1         assert 0  Running this would result in a passed test except for the last ``<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">assert 0</span>\` line which we use to look at values:

`` `pytest     $ pytest test_tmp_path.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 1 item      test_tmp_path.py F                                                   [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     _____________________________ test_create_file _____________________________      tmp_path = PosixPath('PYTEST_TMPDIR/test_create_file0')          def test_create_file(tmp_path):             d = tmp_path / "sub"             d.mkdir()             p = d / "hello.txt"             p.write_text(CONTENT, encoding="utf-8")             assert p.read_text(encoding="utf-8") == CONTENT             assert len(list(tmp_path.iterdir())) == 1     >       assert 0     E       assert 0      test_tmp_path.py:11: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_tmp_path.py::test_create_file - assert 0     ============================ 1 failed in 0.12s =============================  By default, ``pytest`retains the temporary directory for the last 3`pytest`  `<span class="title-ref"> invocations. Concurrent invocations of the same test function are supported by configuring the base temporary directory to be unique for each concurrent run. See \`temporary directory location and retention</span>\_ for details.

## The `tmp_path_factory` fixture

The `tmp_path_factory` is a session-scoped fixture which can be used to create arbitrary temporary directories from any other fixture or test.

For example, suppose your test suite needs a large image on disk, which is generated procedurally. Instead of computing the same image for each test that uses it into its own `tmp_path`, you can generate it once per-session to save time:

  - `` `python     # contents of conftest.py     import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="session")     def image_file(tmp_path_factory):         img = compute_expensive_image()         fn = tmp_path_factory.mktemp("data") / "img.png"         img.save(fn)         return fn       # contents of test_image.py     def test_histogram(image_file):         img = load_image(image_file)         # compute and test histogram  See [tmp_path_factory API <tmp_path_factory factory api>](#tmp_path_factory-api-<tmp_path_factory-factory-api>) for details.    .. _tmpdir:  The ``tmpdir`and`tmpdir\_factory`fixtures ----------------------------------------------  The`tmpdir`and`tmpdir\_factory`fixtures are similar to`tmp\_path`and`tmp\_path\_factory``, but use/return legacy `py.path.local`_ objects rather than standard `pathlib.Path` objects.  .. note::     These days, it is preferred to use``tmp\_path`and`tmp\_path\_factory`.      In order to help modernize old code bases, one can run pytest with the legacypath     plugin disabled:`\`bash  
    pytest -p no:legacypath
    
    This will trigger errors on tests using the legacy paths. It can also be permanently set as part of the `addopts` parameter in the config file.

See `tmpdir <tmpdir>` `tmpdir_factory <tmpdir_factory>` `` ` API for details.   .. _`temporary directory location and retention`:  Temporary directory location and retention ------------------------------------------  The temporary directories, as returned by the :fixture:`tmp_path` and (now deprecated) :fixture:`tmpdir` fixtures, are automatically created under a base temporary directory, in a structure that depends on the ``--basetemp`option:  - By default (when the`--basetemp`option is not set),   the temporary directories will follow this template:`\`text {temproot}/pytest-of-{user}/pytest-{num}/{testname}/

> where:
> 
>   - `{temproot}` is the system temporary directory as determined by :py\`tempfile.gettempdir\`. It can be overridden by the `PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT` environment variable.
>   - `{user}` is the user name running the tests,
>   - `{num}` is a number that is incremented with each test suite run
>   - `{testname}` is a sanitized version of :py\`the name of the current test \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.name\>\`.
> 
> The auto-incrementing `{num}` placeholder provides a basic retention feature and avoids that existing results of previous test runs are blindly removed. By default, the last 3 temporary directories are kept, but this behavior can be configured with `tmp_path_retention_count` and `tmp_path_retention_policy`.

  - \- When the `--basetemp` option is used (e.g. `pytest --basetemp=mydir`),  
    it will be used directly as base temporary directory:
    
    ``` text
    {basetemp}/{testname}/
    ```
    
    Note that there is no retention feature in this case: only the results of the most recent run will be kept.
    
    \> **Warning**

  - \>  
    The directory given to `--basetemp` will be cleared blindly before each test run, so make sure to use a directory for that purpose only.

When distributing tests on the local machine using `pytest-xdist`, care is taken to \`\`<span class="title-ref"> automatically configure a \`basetemp</span> directory for the sub processes such that all temporary data lands below a single per-test run temporary directory.

# How to use `unittest`-based tests with pytest<span id="unittest.TestCase"></span>

`pytest` supports running Python `unittest`-based tests out of the box. It's meant for leveraging existing `unittest`-based test suites to use pytest as a test runner and also allow to incrementally adapt the test suite to take full advantage of pytest's features.

To run an existing `unittest`-style test suite using `pytest`, type:

`` `bash     pytest tests   pytest will automatically collect ``unittest.TestCase`subclasses and`<span class="title-ref"> their </span><span class="title-ref">test</span><span class="title-ref"> methods in </span><span class="title-ref">test\_\*.py</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">\*\_test.py</span>\` files.

Almost all `unittest` features are supported:

  - `@unittest.skip` style decorators;
  - `setUp/tearDown`;
  - `setUpClass/tearDownClass`;
  - `setUpModule/tearDownModule`;

Additionally, \[subtests \<python:subtests\>\](\#subtests-\<python:subtests\>) are supported by the [pytest-subtests](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-subtests) plugin.

Up to this point pytest does not have support for the following features:

  - [load\_tests protocol](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html#load-tests-protocol);

## Benefits out of the box

By running your test suite with pytest you can make use of several features, in most cases without having to modify existing code:

  - Obtain \[more informative tracebacks \<tbreportdemo\>\](\#more-informative-tracebacks-\<tbreportdemo\>);
  - \[stdout and stderr \<captures\>\](\#stdout-and-stderr-\<captures\>) capturing;
  - \[Test selection options \<select-tests\>\](\#test-selection-options-\<select-tests\>) using `-k` and `-m` flags;
  - \[maxfail\](\#maxfail);
  - \[--pdb \<pdb-option\>\](\#--pdb-\<pdb-option\>) command-line option for debugging on test failures (see \[note \<pdb-unittest-note\>\](\#note-\<pdb-unittest-note\>) below);
  - Distribute tests to multiple CPUs using the `pytest-xdist` plugin;
  - Use \[plain assert-statements \<assert\>\](\#plain-assert-statements-\<assert\>) instead of `self.assert*` functions (`unittest2pytest` is immensely helpful in this);

## pytest features in `unittest.TestCase` subclasses

The following pytest features work in `unittest.TestCase` subclasses:

  - \[Marks \<mark\>\](\#marks-\<mark\>): \[skip \<skip\>\](\#skip-\<skip\>), \[skipif \<skipif\>\](\#skipif-\<skipif\>), \[xfail \<xfail\>\](\#xfail-\<xfail\>);
  - \[Auto-use fixtures \<mixing-fixtures\>\](\#auto-use-fixtures-\<mixing-fixtures\>);

The following pytest features **do not** work, and probably never will due to different design philosophies:

  - \[Fixtures \<fixture\>\](\#fixtures-\<fixture\>) (except for `autouse` fixtures, see \[below \<mixing-fixtures\>\](\#below-\<mixing-fixtures\>));
  - \[Parametrization \<parametrize\>\](\#parametrization-\<parametrize\>);
  - \[Custom hooks \<writing-plugins\>\](\#custom-hooks-\<writing-plugins\>);

Third party plugins may or may not work well, depending on the plugin and the test suite.

## Mixing pytest fixtures into `unittest.TestCase` subclasses using marks

Running your unittest with `pytest` allows you to use its \[fixture mechanism \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-mechanism-\<fixture\>) with `unittest.TestCase` style tests. Assuming you have at least skimmed the pytest fixture features, let's jump-start into an example that integrates a pytest `db_class` fixture, setting up a class-cached database object, and then reference it from a unittest-style test:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      # we define a fixture function below and it will be "used" by     # referencing its name from tests      import pytest       @pytest.fixture(scope="class")     def db_class(request):         class DummyDB:             pass          # set a class attribute on the invoking test context         request.cls.db = DummyDB()  This defines a fixture function ``db\_class`which - if used - is`<span class="title-ref"> called once for each test class and which sets the class-level </span><span class="title-ref">db</span><span class="title-ref"> attribute to a </span><span class="title-ref">DummyDB</span><span class="title-ref"> instance. The fixture function achieves this by receiving a special </span><span class="title-ref">request</span><span class="title-ref"> object which gives access to \[the requesting test context \<request-context\>\](\#the-requesting-test-context-\<request-context\>) such as the </span><span class="title-ref">cls</span><span class="title-ref"> attribute, denoting the class from which the fixture is used. This architecture de-couples fixture writing from actual test code and allows reuse of the fixture by a minimal reference, the fixture name. So let's write an actual </span><span class="title-ref">unittest.TestCase</span>\` class using our fixture definition:

`` `python     # content of test_unittest_db.py      import unittest      import pytest       @pytest.mark.usefixtures("db_class")     class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):         def test_method1(self):             assert hasattr(self, "db")             assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes          def test_method2(self):             assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes  The ``@pytest.mark.usefixtures("db\_class")`class-decorator makes sure that`<span class="title-ref"> the pytest fixture function </span><span class="title-ref">db\_class</span><span class="title-ref"> is called once per class. Due to the deliberately failing assert statements, we can take a look at the </span><span class="title-ref">self.db</span>\` values in the traceback:

`` `pytest     $ pytest test_unittest_db.py     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     collected 2 items      test_unittest_db.py FF                                               [100%]      ================================= FAILURES =================================     ___________________________ MyTest.test_method1 ____________________________      self = <test_unittest_db.MyTest testMethod=test_method1>          def test_method1(self):             assert hasattr(self, "db")     >       assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes     E       AssertionError: <conftest.db_class.<locals>.DummyDB object at 0xdeadbeef0001>     E       assert 0      test_unittest_db.py:11: AssertionError     ___________________________ MyTest.test_method2 ____________________________      self = <test_unittest_db.MyTest testMethod=test_method2>          def test_method2(self):     >       assert 0, self.db  # fail for demo purposes     E       AssertionError: <conftest.db_class.<locals>.DummyDB object at 0xdeadbeef0001>     E       assert 0      test_unittest_db.py:14: AssertionError     ========================= short test summary info ==========================     FAILED test_unittest_db.py::MyTest::test_method1 - AssertionError: <conft...     FAILED test_unittest_db.py::MyTest::test_method2 - AssertionError: <conft...     ============================ 2 failed in 0.12s =============================  This default pytest traceback shows that the two test methods ``<span class="title-ref"> share the same </span><span class="title-ref">self.db</span>\` instance which was our intention when writing the class-scoped fixture function above.

## Using autouse fixtures and accessing other fixtures

Although it's usually better to explicitly declare use of fixtures you need for a given test, you may sometimes want to have fixtures that are automatically used in a given context. After all, the traditional style of unittest-setup mandates the use of this implicit fixture writing and chances are, you are used to it or like it.

You can flag fixture functions with `@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)` and define the fixture function in the context where you want it used. Let's look at an `initdir` fixture which makes all test methods of a `TestCase` class execute in a temporary directory with a pre-initialized `samplefile.ini`. Our `initdir` fixture itself uses the pytest builtin `tmp_path` fixture to delegate the creation of a per-test temporary directory:

`` `python     # content of test_unittest_cleandir.py     import unittest      import pytest       class MyTest(unittest.TestCase):         @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)         def initdir(self, tmp_path, monkeypatch):             monkeypatch.chdir(tmp_path)  # change to pytest-provided temporary directory             tmp_path.joinpath("samplefile.ini").write_text("# testdata", encoding="utf-8")          def test_method(self):             with open("samplefile.ini", encoding="utf-8") as f:                 s = f.read()             assert "testdata" in s  Due to the ``autouse`flag the`initdir`fixture function will be`<span class="title-ref"> used for all methods of the class where it is defined. This is a shortcut for using a </span><span class="title-ref">@pytest.mark.usefixtures("initdir")</span>\` marker on the class like in the previous example.

Running this test module ...:

`` `pytest     $ pytest -q test_unittest_cleandir.py     .                                                                    [100%]     1 passed in 0.12s  ... gives us one passed test because the ``initdir`fixture function`<span class="title-ref"> was executed ahead of the </span><span class="title-ref">test\_method</span>\`.

\> **Note** \> `unittest.TestCase` methods cannot directly receive fixture arguments as implementing that is likely to inflict on the ability to run general unittest.TestCase test suites.

> The above `usefixtures` and `autouse` examples should help to mix in pytest fixtures into unittest suites.
> 
> You can also gradually move away from subclassing from `unittest.TestCase` to *plain asserts* and then start to benefit from the full pytest feature set step by step.

<div id="pdb-unittest-note">

Note

</div>

Due to architectural differences between the two frameworks, setup and teardown for `unittest`-based tests is performed during the `call` phase of testing instead of in `pytest`'s standard `setup` and `teardown` stages. This can be important to understand in some situations, particularly when reasoning about errors. For example, if a `unittest`-based suite exhibits errors during setup, `pytest` will report no errors during its `setup` phase and will instead raise the error during `call`.

# How to invoke pytest

<div class="seealso">

\[Complete pytest command-line flag reference \<command-line-flags\>\](\#complete-pytest-command-line-flag-reference-\<command-line-flags\>)

</div>

In general, pytest is invoked with the command `pytest` (see below for \[other ways to invoke pytest \<invoke-other\>\](\#other-ways-to-invoke-pytest \<invoke-other\>)). This will execute all tests in all files whose names follow the form `test_*.py` or `\*_test.py` in the current directory and its subdirectories. More generally, pytest follows \[standard test discovery rules \<test discovery\>\](\#standard-test-discovery-rules \<test-discovery\>).

## Specifying which tests to run

Pytest supports several ways to run and select tests from the command-line or from a file (see below for \[reading arguments from file \<args-from-file\>\](\#reading-arguments-from-file-\<args-from-file\>)).

**Run tests in a module**

`` `bash     pytest test_mod.py  **Run tests in a directory**  .. code-block:: bash      pytest testing/  **Run tests by keyword expressions**  .. code-block:: bash      pytest -k 'MyClass and not method'  This will run tests which contain names that match the given *string expression* (case-insensitive), ``<span class="title-ref"> which can include Python operators that use filenames, class names and function names as variables. The example above will run </span><span class="title-ref">TestMyClass.test\_something</span><span class="title-ref"> but not </span><span class="title-ref">TestMyClass.test\_method\_simple</span><span class="title-ref">. Use </span><span class="title-ref">""</span><span class="title-ref"> instead of </span><span class="title-ref">''</span>\` in expression when running this on Windows

<div id="nodeids">

**Run tests by collection arguments**

</div>

Pass the module filename relative to the working directory, followed by specifiers like the class name and function name separated by `::` characters, and parameters from parameterization enclosed in `[]`.

To run a specific test within a module:

`` `bash     pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func  To run all tests in a class:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass  Specifying a specific test method:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest tests/test_mod.py::TestClass::test_method  Specifying a specific parametrization of a test:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest tests/test_mod.py::test_func[x1,y2]  **Run tests by marker expressions**  To run all tests which are decorated with the ``@pytest.mark.slow`decorator:  .. code-block:: bash      pytest -m slow   To run all tests which are decorated with the annotated`@pytest.mark.slow(phase=1)`decorator,`<span class="title-ref"> with the </span><span class="title-ref">phase</span><span class="title-ref"> keyword argument set to </span><span class="title-ref">1</span>\`:

`` `bash     pytest --version   # shows where pytest was imported from     pytest --fixtures  # show available builtin function arguments     pytest -h | --help # show help on command line and config file options   .. _durations:  Profiling test execution duration ``\` -------------------------------------

<div class="versionchanged">

To get a list of the slowest 10 test durations over 1.0s long:

`` `bash     pytest --durations=10 --durations-min=1.0  By default, pytest will not show test durations that are too small (<0.005s) unless ``-vv`is passed on the command-line.   Managing loading of plugins`\` -------------------------------

### Early loading plugins

You can early-load plugins (internal and external) explicitly in the command-line with the `-p` option:

    pytest -p mypluginmodule

The option receives a `name` parameter, which can be:

  - A full module dotted name, for example `myproject.plugins`. This dotted name must be importable.

  - The entry-point name of a plugin. This is the name passed to `importlib` when the plugin is registered. For example to early-load the `pytest-cov` plugin you can use:
    
        pytest -p pytest_cov

### Disabling plugins

To disable loading specific plugins at invocation time, use the `-p` option together with the prefix `no:`.

Example: to disable loading the plugin `doctest`, which is responsible for executing doctest tests from text files, invoke pytest like this:

`` `bash     pytest -p no:doctest   .. _invoke-other:  Other ways of calling pytest ``\` -----------------------------------------------------

### Calling pytest through `python -m pytest`

You can invoke testing through the Python interpreter from the command line:

`` `text     python -m pytest [...]  This is almost equivalent to invoking the command line script ``pytest \[...\]`  `<span class="title-ref"> directly, except that calling via </span><span class="title-ref">python</span><span class="title-ref"> will also add the current directory to </span><span class="title-ref">sys.path</span>\`.

### Calling pytest from Python code

You can invoke `pytest` from Python code directly:

`` `python     retcode = pytest.main()  this acts as if you would call "pytest" from the command line. ``<span class="title-ref"> It will not raise \`SystemExit</span> but return the \[exit code \<exit-codes\>\](\#exit-code-\<exit-codes\>) instead. If you don't pass it any arguments, `main` reads the arguments from the command line arguments of the process (<span class="title-ref">sys.argv</span>), which may be undesirable. You can pass in options and arguments explicitly:

`` `python     retcode = pytest.main(["-x", "mytestdir"])  You can specify additional plugins to ``pytest.main`:  .. code-block:: python      # content of myinvoke.py     import sys      import pytest       class MyPlugin:         def pytest_sessionfinish(self):             print("*** test run reporting finishing")       if __name__ == "__main__":         sys.exit(pytest.main(["-qq"], plugins=[MyPlugin()]))  Running it will show that`MyPlugin`was added and its`\` hook was invoked:

`` `pytest     $ python myinvoke.py     *** test run reporting finishing   > **Note** >  Calling ``pytest.main()`will result in importing your tests and any modules that they import. Due to the caching mechanism of python's import system, making subsequent calls to`pytest.main()`from the same process will not reflect changes to those files between the calls. For this reason, making multiple calls to`pytest.main()`from the same process (in order to re-run tests, for example) is not recommended.`\`

# Writing hook functions

## hook function validation and execution

pytest calls hook functions from registered plugins for any given hook specification. Let's look at a typical hook function for the `pytest_collection_modifyitems(session, config, items)` hook which pytest calls after collection of all test items is completed.

When we implement a `pytest_collection_modifyitems` function in our plugin pytest will during registration verify that you use argument names which match the specification and bail out if not.

Let's look at a possible implementation:

`` `python     def pytest_collection_modifyitems(config, items):         # called after collection is completed         # you can modify the ``items`list         ...  Here,`pytest`will pass in`config`(the pytest config object)`<span class="title-ref"> and </span><span class="title-ref">items</span><span class="title-ref"> (the list of collected test items) but will not pass in the </span><span class="title-ref">session</span><span class="title-ref"> argument because we didn't list it in the function signature. This dynamic "pruning" of arguments allows </span><span class="title-ref">pytest</span>\` to be "future-compatible": we can introduce new hook named parameters without breaking the signatures of existing hook implementations. It is one of the reasons for the general long-lived compatibility of pytest plugins.

Note that hook functions other than `pytest_runtest_*` are not allowed to raise exceptions. Doing so will break the pytest run.

## firstresult: stop at first non-None result

Most calls to `pytest` hooks result in a **list of results** which contains all non-None results of the called hook functions.

Some hook specifications use the `firstresult=True` option so that the hook call only executes until the first of N registered functions returns a non-None result which is then taken as result of the overall hook call. The remaining hook functions will not be called in this case.

## hook wrappers: executing around other hooks

pytest plugins can implement hook wrappers which wrap the execution of other hook implementations. A hook wrapper is a generator function which yields exactly once. When pytest invokes hooks it first executes hook wrappers and passes the same arguments as to the regular hooks.

At the yield point of the hook wrapper pytest will execute the next hook implementations and return their result to the yield point, or will propagate an exception if they raised.

Here is an example definition of a hook wrapper:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True)     def pytest_pyfunc_call(pyfuncitem):         do_something_before_next_hook_executes()          # If the outcome is an exception, will raise the exception.         res = yield          new_res = post_process_result(res)          # Override the return value to the plugin system.         return new_res  The hook wrapper needs to return a result for the hook, or raise an exception.  In many cases, the wrapper only needs to perform tracing or other side effects ``<span class="title-ref"> around the actual hook implementations, in which case it can return the result value of the </span><span class="title-ref">yield</span><span class="title-ref">. The simplest (though useless) hook wrapper is </span><span class="title-ref">return (yield)</span>\`.

In other cases, the wrapper wants the adjust or adapt the result, in which case it can return a new value. If the result of the underlying hook is a mutable object, the wrapper may modify that result, but it's probably better to avoid it.

If the hook implementation failed with an exception, the wrapper can handle that exception using a `try-catch-finally` around the `yield`, by propagating it, suppressing it, or raising a different exception entirely.

For more information, consult the \[pluggy documentation about hook wrappers \<pluggy:hookwrappers\>\](\#pluggy-documentation-about-hook-wrappers-\<pluggy:hookwrappers\>).

## Hook function ordering / call example

For any given hook specification there may be more than one implementation and we thus generally view `hook` execution as a `1:N` function call where `N` is the number of registered functions. There are ways to influence if a hook implementation comes before or after others, i.e. the position in the `N`-sized list of functions:

`` `python     # Plugin 1     @pytest.hookimpl(tryfirst=True)     def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):         # will execute as early as possible         ...       # Plugin 2     @pytest.hookimpl(trylast=True)     def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):         # will execute as late as possible         ...       # Plugin 3     @pytest.hookimpl(wrapper=True)     def pytest_collection_modifyitems(items):         # will execute even before the tryfirst one above!         try:             return (yield)         finally:             # will execute after all non-wrappers executed             ...  Here is the order of execution:  1. Plugin3's pytest_collection_modifyitems called until the yield point    because it is a hook wrapper.  2. Plugin1's pytest_collection_modifyitems is called because it is marked    with ``tryfirst=True`.  3. Plugin2's pytest_collection_modifyitems is called because it is marked    with`trylast=True`(but even without this mark it would come after    Plugin1).  4. Plugin3's pytest_collection_modifyitems then executing the code after the yield    point.  The yield receives the result from calling the non-wrappers, or raises    an exception if the non-wrappers raised.  It's possible to use`tryfirst`and`trylast`also on hook wrappers`\` in which case it will influence the ordering of hook wrappers among each other.

## Declaring new hooks

\> **Note** \> This is a quick overview on how to add new hooks and how they work in general, but a more complete overview can be found in [the pluggy documentation](https://pluggy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

Plugins and `conftest.py` files may declare new hooks that can then be implemented by other plugins in order to alter behaviour or interact with the new plugin:

<div class="autofunction" data-noindex="">

\_pytest.hookspec.pytest\_addhooks

</div>

Hooks are usually declared as do-nothing functions that contain only documentation describing when the hook will be called and what return values are expected. The names of the functions must start with <span class="title-ref">pytest\_</span> otherwise pytest won't recognize them.

Here's an example. Let's assume this code is in the `sample_hook.py` module.

`` `python     def pytest_my_hook(config):         """         Receives the pytest config and does things with it         """  To register the hooks with pytest they need to be structured in their own module or class. This ``<span class="title-ref"> class or module can then be passed to the </span><span class="title-ref">pluginmanager</span><span class="title-ref"> using the </span><span class="title-ref">pytest\_addhooks</span>\` function (which itself is a hook exposed by pytest).

`` `python     def pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager):         """This example assumes the hooks are grouped in the 'sample_hook' module."""         from my_app.tests import sample_hook          pluginmanager.add_hookspecs(sample_hook)  For a real world example, see `newhooks.py`_ from `xdist <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-xdist>`_.    Hooks may be called both from fixtures or from other hooks. In both cases, hooks are called ``<span class="title-ref"> through the </span><span class="title-ref">hook</span><span class="title-ref"> object, available in the </span><span class="title-ref">config</span><span class="title-ref"> object. Most hooks receive a </span><span class="title-ref">config</span><span class="title-ref"> object directly, while fixtures may use the </span><span class="title-ref">pytestconfig</span>\` fixture which provides the same object.

`` `python     @pytest.fixture()     def my_fixture(pytestconfig):         # call the hook called "pytest_my_hook"         # 'result' will be a list of return values from all registered functions.         result = pytestconfig.hook.pytest_my_hook(config=pytestconfig)  .. note::     Hooks receive parameters using only keyword arguments.  Now your hook is ready to be used. To register a function at the hook, other plugins or users must ``<span class="title-ref"> now simply define the function </span><span class="title-ref">pytest\_my\_hook</span><span class="title-ref"> with the correct signature in their </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\`.

Example:

`` `python     def pytest_my_hook(config):         """         Print all active hooks to the screen.         """         print(config.hook)   .. _`addoptionhooks`:   Using hooks in pytest_addoption ``\` -------------------------------

Occasionally, it is necessary to change the way in which command line options are defined by one plugin based on hooks in another plugin. For example, a plugin may expose a command line option for which another plugin needs to define the default value. The pluginmanager can be used to install and use hooks to accomplish this. The plugin would define and add the hooks and use pytest\_addoption as follows:

`` `python    # contents of hooks.py      # Use firstresult=True because we only want one plugin to define this    # default value    @hookspec(firstresult=True)    def pytest_config_file_default_value():        """Return the default value for the config file command line option."""      # contents of myplugin.py      def pytest_addhooks(pluginmanager):        """This example assumes the hooks are grouped in the 'hooks' module."""        from . import hooks         pluginmanager.add_hookspecs(hooks)      def pytest_addoption(parser, pluginmanager):        default_value = pluginmanager.hook.pytest_config_file_default_value()        parser.addoption(            "--config-file",            help="Config file to use, defaults to %(default)s",            default=default_value,        )  The conftest.py that is using myplugin would simply define the hook as follows:  .. code-block:: python      def pytest_config_file_default_value():         return "config.yaml"   Optionally using hooks from 3rd party plugins ``\` ---------------------------------------------

Using new hooks from plugins as explained above might be a little tricky because of the standard \[validation mechanism \<validation\>\](\#validation-mechanism-\<validation\>): if you depend on a plugin that is not installed, validation will fail and the error message will not make much sense to your users.

One approach is to defer the hook implementation to a new plugin instead of declaring the hook functions directly in your plugin module, for example:

`` `python     # contents of myplugin.py       class DeferPlugin:         """Simple plugin to defer pytest-xdist hook functions."""          def pytest_testnodedown(self, node, error):             """standard xdist hook function."""       def pytest_configure(config):         if config.pluginmanager.hasplugin("xdist"):             config.pluginmanager.register(DeferPlugin())  This has the added benefit of allowing you to conditionally install hooks ``\` depending on which plugins are installed.

## Storing data on items across hook functions

Plugins often need to store data on <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Item</span>s in one hook implementation, and access it in another. One common solution is to just assign some private attribute directly on the item, but type-checkers like mypy frown upon this, and it may also cause conflicts with other plugins. So pytest offers a better way to do this, <span class="title-ref">item.stash \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.stash\></span>.

To use the "stash" in your plugins, first create "stash keys" somewhere at the top level of your plugin:

`` `python     been_there_key = pytest.StashKey[bool]()     done_that_key = pytest.StashKey[str]()  then use the keys to stash your data at some point:  .. code-block:: python      def pytest_runtest_setup(item: pytest.Item) -> None:         item.stash[been_there_key] = True         item.stash[done_that_key] = "no"  and retrieve them at another point:  .. code-block:: python      def pytest_runtest_teardown(item: pytest.Item) -> None:         if not item.stash[been_there_key]:             print("Oh?")         item.stash[done_that_key] = "yes!"  Stashes are available on all node types (like `~pytest.Class`, ``<span class="title-ref"> </span>\~pytest.Session\`) and also on <span class="title-ref">\~pytest.Config</span>, if needed.

# Writing plugins<span id="plugins"></span>

It is easy to implement [local conftest plugins](#local%20conftest%20plugins) for your own project or [pip-installable plugins](#pip-installable%20plugins) that can be used throughout many projects, including third party projects. Please refer to \[using plugins\](\#using-plugins) if you only want to use but not write plugins.

A plugin contains one or multiple hook functions. \[Writing hooks \<writinghooks\>\](\#writing-hooks-\<writinghooks\>) explains the basics and details of how you can write a hook function yourself. `pytest` implements all aspects of configuration, collection, running and reporting by calling \[well specified hooks \<hook-reference\>\](\#well-specified-hooks-\<hook-reference\>) of the following plugins:

  - builtin plugins: loaded from pytest's internal `_pytest` directory.
  - \[external plugins \<extplugins\>\](\#external-plugins-\<extplugins\>): installed third-party modules discovered through \[entry points \<pip-installable plugins\>\](\#entry-points-\<pip-installable-plugins\>) in their packaging metadata
  - [conftest.py plugins](#conftest.py%20plugins): modules auto-discovered in test directories

In principle, each hook call is a `1:N` Python function call where `N` is the number of registered implementation functions for a given specification. All specifications and implementations follow the `pytest_` prefix naming convention, making them easy to distinguish and find.

## Plugin discovery order at tool startup

`pytest` loads plugin modules at tool startup in the following way:

1.  by scanning the command line for the `-p no:name` option and *blocking* that plugin from being loaded (even builtin plugins can be blocked this way). This happens before normal command-line parsing.
2.  by loading all builtin plugins.
3.  by scanning the command line for the `-p name` option and loading the specified plugin. This happens before normal command-line parsing.
4.  by loading all plugins registered through installed third-party package \[entry points \<pip-installable plugins\>\](\#entry-points-\<pip-installable-plugins\>), unless the `PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD` environment variable is set.
5.  by loading all plugins specified through the `PYTEST_PLUGINS` environment variable.
6.  by loading all "initial "`conftest.py` files:
      - determine the test paths: specified on the command line, otherwise in `testpaths` if defined and running from the rootdir, otherwise the current dir
      - for each test path, load `conftest.py` and `test*/conftest.py` relative to the directory part of the test path, if exist. Before a `conftest.py` file is loaded, load `conftest.py` files in all of its parent directories. After a `conftest.py` file is loaded, recursively load all plugins specified in its `pytest_plugins` variable if present.

## conftest.py: local per-directory plugins<span id="localplugin"></span><span id="conftest.py plugins"></span>

Local `conftest.py` plugins contain directory-specific hook implementations. Hook Session and test running activities will invoke all hooks defined in `conftest.py` files closer to the root of the filesystem. Example of implementing the `pytest_runtest_setup` hook so that is called for tests in the `a` sub directory but not for other directories:

    a/conftest.py:
        def pytest_runtest_setup(item):
            # called for running each test in 'a' directory
            print("setting up", item)
    
    a/test_sub.py:
        def test_sub():
            pass
    
    test_flat.py:
        def test_flat():
            pass

Here is how you might run it:

        pytest test_flat.py --capture=no  # will not show "setting up"
        pytest a/test_sub.py --capture=no  # will show "setting up"

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If you have `conftest.py` files which do not reside in a python package directory (i.e. one containing an `__init__.py`) then "import conftest" can be ambiguous because there might be other `conftest.py` files as well on your `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path`. It is thus good practice for projects to either put `conftest.py` under a package scope or to never import anything from a `conftest.py` file.

See also: \[pythonpath\](\#pythonpath).

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Some hooks cannot be implemented in conftest.py files which are not \[initial \<pluginorder\>\](\#initial-\<pluginorder\>) due to how pytest discovers plugins during startup. See the documentation of each hook for details.

</div>

## Writing your own plugin

If you want to write a plugin, there are many real-life examples you can copy from:

  - a custom collection example plugin: \[yaml plugin\](\#yaml-plugin)
  - builtin plugins which provide pytest's own functionality
  - many \[external plugins \<plugin-list\>\](\#external-plugins-\<plugin-list\>) providing additional features

All of these plugins implement \[hooks \<hook-reference\>\](\#hooks-\<hook-reference\>) and/or \[fixtures \<fixture\>\](\#fixtures-\<fixture\>) to extend and add functionality.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Make sure to check out the excellent [cookiecutter-pytest-plugin](https://github.com/pytest-dev/cookiecutter-pytest-plugin) project, which is a [cookiecutter template](https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter) for authoring plugins.

The template provides an excellent starting point with a working plugin, tests running with tox, a comprehensive README file as well as a pre-configured entry-point.

</div>

Also consider \[contributing your plugin to pytest-dev\<submitplugin\>\](\#contributing-your-plugin-to-pytest-dev\<submitplugin\>) once it has some happy users other than yourself.

## Making your plugin installable by others<span id="setuptools entry points"></span>

If you want to make your plugin externally available, you may define a so-called entry point for your distribution so that `pytest` finds your plugin module. Entry points are a feature that is provided by :std\[packaging tools \<packaging:specifications/entry-points\>\](packaging tools \<packaging:specifications/entry-points\>.md).

pytest looks up the `pytest11` entrypoint to discover its plugins, thus you can make your plugin available by defining it in your `pyproject.toml` file.

``` toml
# sample ./pyproject.toml file
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"

[project]
name = "myproject"
classifiers = [
    "Framework :: Pytest",
]

[project.entry-points.pytest11]
myproject = "myproject.pluginmodule"
```

If a package is installed this way, `pytest` will load `myproject.pluginmodule` as a plugin which can define \[hooks \<hook-reference\>\](\#hooks-\<hook-reference\>). Confirm registration with `pytest --trace-config`

\> **Note** \> Make sure to include `Framework :: Pytest` in your list of [PyPI classifiers](https://pypi.org/classifiers/) to make it easy for users to find your plugin.

## Assertion Rewriting

One of the main features of `pytest` is the use of plain assert statements and the detailed introspection of expressions upon assertion failures. This is provided by "assertion rewriting" which modifies the parsed AST before it gets compiled to bytecode. This is done via a `302` import hook which gets installed early on when `pytest` starts up and will perform this rewriting when modules get imported. However, since we do not want to test different bytecode from what you will run in production, this hook only rewrites test modules themselves (as defined by the `python_files` configuration option), and any modules which are part of plugins. Any other imported module will not be rewritten and normal assertion behaviour will happen.

If you have assertion helpers in other modules where you would need assertion rewriting to be enabled you need to ask `pytest` explicitly to rewrite this module before it gets imported.

<div class="autofunction" data-noindex="">

pytest.register\_assert\_rewrite

</div>

This is especially important when you write a pytest plugin which is created using a package. The import hook only treats `conftest.py` files and any modules which are listed in the `pytest11` entrypoint as plugins. As an example consider the following package:

    pytest_foo/__init__.py
    pytest_foo/plugin.py
    pytest_foo/helper.py

With the following typical `setup.py` extract:

`` `python    setup(..., entry_points={"pytest11": ["foo = pytest_foo.plugin"]}, ...)  In this case only ``pytest\_foo/plugin.py`will be rewritten.  If the`<span class="title-ref"> helper module also contains assert statements which need to be rewritten it needs to be marked as such, before it gets imported. This is easiest by marking it for rewriting inside the </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_.py</span><span class="title-ref"> module, which will always be imported first when a module inside a package is imported. This way </span><span class="title-ref">plugin.py</span><span class="title-ref"> can still import </span><span class="title-ref">helper.py</span><span class="title-ref"> normally. The contents of </span><span class="title-ref">pytest\_foo/\_\_init\_\_.py</span>\` will then need to look like this:

`` `python    import pytest     pytest.register_assert_rewrite("pytest_foo.helper")   Requiring/Loading plugins in a test module or conftest file ``\` -----------------------------------------------------------

You can require plugins in a test module or a `conftest.py` file using `pytest_plugins`:

`` `python     pytest_plugins = ["name1", "name2"]  When the test module or conftest plugin is loaded the specified plugins ``\` will be loaded as well. Any module can be blessed as a plugin, including internal application modules:

`` `python     pytest_plugins = "myapp.testsupport.myplugin"  :globalvar:`pytest_plugins` are processed recursively, so note that in the example above ``<span class="title-ref"> if </span><span class="title-ref">myapp.testsupport.myplugin</span><span class="title-ref"> also declares :globalvar:\`pytest\_plugins</span>, the contents of the variable will also be loaded as plugins, and so on.

<div id="requiring plugins in non-root conftests">

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Requiring plugins using `pytest_plugins` variable in non-root `conftest.py` files is deprecated.

This is important because `conftest.py` files implement per-directory hook implementations, but once a plugin is imported, it will affect the entire directory tree. In order to avoid confusion, defining `pytest_plugins` in any `conftest.py` file which is not located in the tests root directory is deprecated, and will raise a warning.

</div>

</div>

This mechanism makes it easy to share fixtures within applications or even external applications without the need to create external plugins using the :std\[entry point packaging metadata \<packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins\>\](entry point packaging metadata \<packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins\>.md) technique.

Plugins imported by `pytest_plugins` will also automatically be marked for assertion rewriting (see <span class="title-ref">pytest.register\_assert\_rewrite</span>). However for this to have any effect the module must not be imported already; if it was already imported at the time the `pytest_plugins` statement is processed, a warning will result and assertions inside the plugin will not be rewritten. To fix this you can either call <span class="title-ref">pytest.register\_assert\_rewrite</span> yourself before the module is imported, or you can arrange the code to delay the importing until after the plugin is registered.

## Accessing another plugin by name

If a plugin wants to collaborate with code from another plugin it can obtain a reference through the plugin manager like this:

``` python
plugin = config.pluginmanager.get_plugin("name_of_plugin")
```

If you want to look at the names of existing plugins, use the `--trace-config` option.

## Registering custom markers

If your plugin uses any markers, you should register them so that they appear in pytest's help text and do not \[cause spurious warnings \<unknown-marks\>\](\#cause-spurious-warnings-\<unknown-marks\>). For example, the following plugin would register `cool_marker` and `mark_with` for all users:

`` `python     def pytest_configure(config):         config.addinivalue_line("markers", "cool_marker: this one is for cool tests.")         config.addinivalue_line(             "markers", "mark_with(arg, arg2): this marker takes arguments."         )   Testing plugins ``\` ---------------

pytest comes with a plugin named `pytester` that helps you write tests for your plugin code. The plugin is disabled by default, so you will have to enable it before you can use it.

You can do so by adding the following line to a `conftest.py` file in your testing directory:

`` `python     # content of conftest.py      pytest_plugins = ["pytester"]  Alternatively you can invoke pytest with the ``-p pytester`command line`\` option.

This will allow you to use the :py\`pytester \<pytest.Pytester\>\` fixture for testing your plugin code.

Let's demonstrate what you can do with the plugin with an example. Imagine we developed a plugin that provides a fixture `hello` which yields a function and we can invoke this function with one optional parameter. It will return a string value of `Hello World!` if we do not supply a value or `Hello {value}!` if we do supply a string value.

`` `python     import pytest       def pytest_addoption(parser):         group = parser.getgroup("helloworld")         group.addoption(             "--name",             action="store",             dest="name",             default="World",             help='Default "name" for hello().',         )       @pytest.fixture     def hello(request):         name = request.config.getoption("name")          def _hello(name=None):             if not name:                 name = request.config.getoption("name")             return f"Hello {name}!"          return _hello   Now the ``pytester`fixture provides a convenient API for creating temporary`<span class="title-ref"> </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\` files and test files. It also allows us to run the tests and return a result object, with which we can assert the tests' outcomes.

`` `python     def test_hello(pytester):         """Make sure that our plugin works."""          # create a temporary conftest.py file         pytester.makeconftest(             """             import pytest              @pytest.fixture(params=[                 "Brianna",                 "Andreas",                 "Floris",             ])             def name(request):                 return request.param         """         )          # create a temporary pytest test file         pytester.makepyfile(             """             def test_hello_default(hello):                 assert hello() == "Hello World!"              def test_hello_name(hello, name):                 assert hello(name) == "Hello {0}!".format(name)         """         )          # run all tests with pytest         result = pytester.runpytest()          # check that all 4 tests passed         result.assert_outcomes(passed=4)   Additionally it is possible to copy examples to the ``pytester`'s isolated environment`<span class="title-ref"> before running pytest on it. This way we can abstract the tested logic to separate files, which is especially useful for longer tests and/or longer </span><span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span>\` files.

Note that for `pytester.copy_example` to work we need to set <span class="title-ref">pytester\_example\_dir</span> in our `pytest.ini` to tell pytest where to look for example files.

`` `ini   # content of pytest.ini   [pytest]   pytester_example_dir = .   .. code-block:: python      # content of test_example.py       def test_plugin(pytester):         pytester.copy_example("test_example.py")         pytester.runpytest("-k", "test_example")       def test_example():         pass  .. code-block:: pytest      $ pytest     =========================== test session starts ============================     platform linux -- Python 3.x.y, pytest-8.x.y, pluggy-1.x.y     rootdir: /home/sweet/project     configfile: pytest.ini     collected 2 items      test_example.py ..

# How to implement xunit-style set-up<span id="classic xunit"></span>

This section describes a classic and popular way how you can implement fixtures (setup and teardown test state) on a per-module/class/function basis.

\> **Note** \> While these setup/teardown methods are simple and familiar to those coming from a `unittest` or `nose` background, you may also consider using pytest's more powerful \[fixture mechanism \<fixture\>\](\#fixture-mechanism ----\<fixture\>) which leverages the concept of dependency injection, allowing for a more modular and more scalable approach for managing test state, especially for larger projects and for functional testing. You can mix both fixture mechanisms in the same file but test methods of `unittest.TestCase` subclasses cannot receive fixture arguments.

## Module level setup/teardown

If you have multiple test functions and test classes in a single module you can optionally implement the following fixture methods which will usually be called once for all the functions:

`` `python     def setup_module(module):         """setup any state specific to the execution of the given module."""       def teardown_module(module):         """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_module         method.         """  As of pytest-3.0, the ``module`parameter is optional.  Class level setup/teardown`\` ----------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called at class level before and after all test methods of the class are called:

`` `python     @classmethod     def setup_class(cls):         """setup any state specific to the execution of the given class (which         usually contains tests).         """       @classmethod     def teardown_class(cls):         """teardown any state that was previously setup with a call to         setup_class.         """  .. _xunit-method-setup:  Method and function level setup/teardown ``\` -----------------------------------------------

Similarly, the following methods are called around each method invocation:

`` `python     def setup_method(self, method):         """setup any state tied to the execution of the given method in a         class.  setup_method is invoked for every test method of a class.         """       def teardown_method(self, method):         """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_method         call.         """  As of pytest-3.0, the ``method`parameter is optional.  If you would rather define test functions directly at module level`\` you can also use the following functions to implement fixtures:

`` `python     def setup_function(function):         """setup any state tied to the execution of the given function.         Invoked for every test function in the module.         """       def teardown_function(function):         """teardown any state that was previously setup with a setup_function         call.         """  As of pytest-3.0, the ``function`parameter is optional.  Remarks:  * It is possible for setup/teardown pairs to be invoked multiple times   per testing process.  * teardown functions are not called if the corresponding setup function existed   and failed/was skipped.  * Prior to pytest-4.2, xunit-style functions did not obey the scope rules of fixtures, so   it was possible, for example, for a`setup\_method`to be called before a   session-scoped autouse fixture.    Now the xunit-style functions are integrated with the fixture mechanism and obey the proper   scope rules of fixtures involved in the call.`\`

# New pytest names in 2.0 (flat is better than nested)

If you used older version of the `py` distribution (which included the py.test command line tool and Python name space) you accessed helpers and possibly collection classes through the `py.test` Python namespaces. The new `pytest` Python module flatly provides the same objects, following these renaming rules:

    py.test.XYZ          -> pytest.XYZ
    py.test.collect.XYZ  -> pytest.XYZ
    py.test.cmdline.main -> pytest.main

The old `py.test.*` ways to access functionality remain valid but you are encouraged to do global renaming according to the above rules in your test code.

# PROPOSAL: Parametrize with fixtures

\> **Warning** \> This document outlines a proposal around using fixtures as input of parametrized tests or fixtures.

## Problem

As a user I have functional tests that I would like to run against various scenarios.

In this particular example we want to generate a new project based on a cookiecutter template. We want to test default values but also data that emulates user input.

  - use default values
  - emulate user input
      - specify 'author'
      - specify 'project\_slug'
      - specify 'author' and 'project\_slug'

This is how a functional test could look like:

`` `python     import pytest       @pytest.fixture     def default_context():         return {"extra_context": {}}       @pytest.fixture(         params=[             {"author": "alice"},             {"project_slug": "helloworld"},             {"author": "bob", "project_slug": "foobar"},         ]     )     def extra_context(request):         return {"extra_context": request.param}       @pytest.fixture(params=["default", "extra"])     def context(request):         if request.param == "default":             return request.getfuncargvalue("default_context")         else:             return request.getfuncargvalue("extra_context")       def test_generate_project(cookies, context):         """Call the cookiecutter API to generate a new project from a         template.         """         result = cookies.bake(extra_context=context)          assert result.exit_code == 0         assert result.exception is None         assert result.project.isdir()   Issues ``\` ------

  - By using `request.getfuncargvalue()` we rely on actual fixture function execution to know what fixtures are involved, due to its dynamic nature
  - More importantly, `request.getfuncargvalue()` cannot be combined with parametrized fixtures, such as `extra_context`
  - This is very inconvenient if you wish to extend an existing test suite by certain parameters for fixtures that are already used by tests

pytest version 3.0 reports an error if you try to run above code:

    Failed: The requested fixture has no parameter defined for the current
    test.
    
    Requested fixture 'extra_context'

## Proposed solution

A new function that can be used in modules can be used to dynamically define fixtures from existing ones.

`` `python     pytest.define_combined_fixture(         name="context", fixtures=["default_context", "extra_context"]     )  The new fixture ``context`inherits the scope from the used fixtures and yield`\` the following values.

  - `{}`
  - `{'author': 'alice'}`
  - `{'project_slug': 'helloworld'}`
  - `{'author': 'bob', 'project_slug': 'foobar'}`

## Alternative approach

A new helper function named `fixture_request` would tell pytest to yield all parameters marked as a fixture.

\> **Note** \> The `pytest-lazy-fixture` plugin implements a very similar solution to the proposal below, make sure to check it out.

`` `python     @pytest.fixture(         params=[             pytest.fixture_request("default_context"),             pytest.fixture_request("extra_context"),         ]     )     def context(request):         """Returns all values for ``default\_context`, one-by-one before it         does the same for`extra\_context`.          request.param:             - {}             - {'author': 'alice'}             - {'project_slug': 'helloworld'}             - {'author': 'bob', 'project_slug': 'foobar'}         """         return request.param  The same helper can be used in combination with`pytest.mark.parametrize`.  .. code-block:: python       @pytest.mark.parametrize(         "context, expected_response_code",         [             (pytest.fixture_request("default_context"), 0),             (pytest.fixture_request("extra_context"), 0),         ],     )     def test_generate_project(cookies, context, exit_code):         """Call the cookiecutter API to generate a new project from a         template.         """         result = cookies.bake(extra_context=context)          assert result.exit_code == exit_code`\`

# Configuration

## Command line options and configuration file settings

You can get help on command line options and values in INI-style configurations files by using the general help option:

`` `bash     pytest -h   # prints options _and_ config file settings  This will display command line and configuration file settings ``\` which were registered by installed plugins.

## Configuration file formats

Many \[pytest settings \<ini options ref\>\](\#pytest-settings-\<ini-options-ref\>) can be set in a *configuration file*, which by convention resides in the root directory of your repository.

A quick example of the configuration files supported by pytest:

### pytest.ini

`pytest.ini` files take precedence over other files, even when empty.

Alternatively, the hidden version `.pytest.ini` can be used.

`` `ini     # pytest.ini or .pytest.ini     [pytest]     minversion = 6.0     addopts = -ra -q     testpaths =         tests         integration   pyproject.toml ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

<div class="versionadded">

6.0

</div>

`pyproject.toml` are considered for configuration when they contain a `tool.pytest.ini_options` table.

`` `toml     # pyproject.toml     [tool.pytest.ini_options]     minversion = "6.0"     addopts = "-ra -q"     testpaths = [         "tests",         "integration",     ]  > **Note** >      One might wonder why ``\[tool.pytest.ini\_options\]`instead of`\[tool.pytest\]`as is the     case with other tools.      The reason is that the pytest team intends to fully utilize the rich TOML data format     for configuration in the future, reserving the`\[tool.pytest\]`table for that.     The`ini\_options`table is being used, for now, as a bridge between the existing`.ini`configuration system and the future configuration format.  tox.ini`\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~

`tox.ini` files are the configuration files of the [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io) project, and can also be used to hold pytest configuration if they have a `[pytest]` section.

`` `ini     # tox.ini     [pytest]     minversion = 6.0     addopts = -ra -q     testpaths =         tests         integration   setup.cfg ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

`setup.cfg` files are general purpose configuration files, used originally by `distutils` (now deprecated) and :std\[setuptools \<setuptools:userguide/declarative\_config\>\](setuptools \<setuptools:userguide/declarative\_config\>.md), and can also be used to hold pytest configuration if they have a `[tool:pytest]` section.

  - `` `ini     # setup.cfg     [tool:pytest]     minversion = 6.0     addopts = -ra -q     testpaths =         tests         integration  > **Warning** >      Usage of ``setup.cfg`is not recommended unless for very simple use cases.`.cfg`files use a different parser than`pytest.ini`and`tox.ini`which might cause hard to track     down problems.     When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or`pyproject.toml`, to hold your     pytest configuration.     .. _configfiles:  Initialization: determining rootdir and configfile --------------------------------------------------  pytest determines a`rootdir`for each test run which depends on the command line arguments (specified test files, paths) and on the existence of configuration files.  The determined`rootdir`and`configfile`are printed as part of the pytest header during startup.  Here's a summary what`pytest`uses`rootdir`for:  * Construct *nodeids* during collection; each test is assigned   a unique *nodeid* which is rooted at the`rootdir`and takes into account   the full path, class name, function name and parametrization (if any).  * Is used by plugins as a stable location to store project/test run specific information;   for example, the internal [cache <cache>](#cache-<cache>) plugin creates a`.pytest\_cache`subdirectory   in`rootdir`to store its cross-test run state.`rootdir`is **NOT** used to modify`sys.path`/`PYTHONPATH`or influence how modules are imported. See [pythonpath](#pythonpath) for more details.  The`--rootdir=path`command-line option can be used to force a specific directory. Note that contrary to other command-line options,`--rootdir``cannot be used with :confval:`addopts` inside``pytest.ini`because the`rootdir`is used to *find*`pytest.ini`already.  Finding the`rootdir`~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  Here is the algorithm which finds the rootdir from`args`:  - If`-c`is passed in the command-line, use that as configuration file, and its directory as`rootdir`.  - Determine the common ancestor directory for the specified`args`that are   recognised as paths that exist in the file system. If no such paths are   found, the common ancestor directory is set to the current working directory.  - Look for`pytest.ini`,`pyproject.toml`,`tox.ini`, and`setup.cfg`files in the ancestor   directory and upwards.  If one is matched, it becomes the`configfile`and its   directory becomes the`rootdir`.  - If no configuration file was found, look for`setup.py`upwards from the common   ancestor directory to determine the`rootdir`.  - If no`setup.py`was found, look for`pytest.ini`,`pyproject.toml`,`tox.ini`, and`setup.cfg`in each of the specified`args`and upwards. If one is   matched, it becomes the`configfile`and its directory becomes the`rootdir`.  - If no`configfile`was found and no configuration argument is passed, use the already determined common ancestor as root   directory. This allows the use of pytest in structures that are not part of   a package and don't have any particular configuration file.  If no`args`are given, pytest collects test below the current working directory and also starts determining the`rootdir`from there.  Files will only be matched for configuration if:  *`pytest.ini`: will always match and take precedence, even if empty. *`pyproject.toml`: contains a`\[tool.pytest.ini\_options\]`table. *`tox.ini`: contains a`\[pytest\]`section. *`setup.cfg`: contains a`\[<tool:pytest>\]`section.  Finally, a`pyproject.toml`file will be considered the`configfile`if no other match was found, in this case even if it does not contain a`\[tool.pytest.ini\_options\]`table (this was added in`8.1`).  The files are considered in the order above. Options from multiple`configfiles`candidates are never merged - the first match wins.  The configuration file also determines the value of the`rootpath``.  The `Config <pytest.Config>` object (accessible via hooks or through the :fixture:`pytestconfig` fixture) will subsequently carry these attributes:  - `config.rootpath <pytest.Config.rootpath>`: the determined root directory, guaranteed to exist. It is used as   a reference directory for constructing test addresses ("nodeids") and can be used also by plugins for storing   per-testrun information.  - `config.inipath <pytest.Config.inipath>`: the determined``configfile`, may be`None`(it is named`inipath`for historical reasons).  .. versionadded:: 6.1     The`config.rootpath`and`config.inipath``properties. They are `pathlib.Path`     versions of the older``config.rootdir`and`config.inifile`, which have type`py.path.local`, and still exist for backward compatibility.    Example:`\`bash  
    pytest path/to/testdir path/other/

will determine the common ancestor as `path` and then `` ` check for configuration files as follows: ``\`text \# first look for pytest.ini files path/pytest.ini path/pyproject.toml \# must contain a \[tool.pytest.ini\_options\] table to match path/tox.ini \# must contain \[pytest\] section to match path/setup.cfg \# must contain \[<tool:pytest>\] section to match pytest.ini ... \# all the way up to the root

> \# now look for setup.py path/setup.py setup.py ... \# all the way up to the root

\> **Warning** \> Custom pytest plugin commandline arguments may include a path, as in `pytest --log-output ../../test.log args`. Then `args` is mandatory, otherwise pytest uses the folder of test.log for rootdir determination (see also `1435`). A dot `.` for referencing to the current working directory is also possible.

## Builtin configuration file options

For the full list of options consult the \[reference documentation \<ini options ref\>\](\#reference-documentation-\<ini-options-ref\>).

## Syntax highlighting theme customization

The syntax highlighting themes used by pytest can be customized using two environment variables:

  - `PYTEST_THEME` sets a [pygment style](https://pygments.org/docs/styles/) to use.
  - `PYTEST_THEME_MODE` sets this style to *light* or *dark*.

exit-codes.md

# Exit codes

Running `pytest` can result in six different exit codes:

  - Exit code 0  
    All tests were collected and passed successfully

  - Exit code 1  
    Tests were collected and run but some of the tests failed

  - Exit code 2  
    Test execution was interrupted by the user

  - Exit code 3  
    Internal error happened while executing tests

  - Exit code 4  
    pytest command line usage error

  - Exit code 5  
    No tests were collected

They are represented by the <span class="title-ref">pytest.ExitCode</span> enum. The exit codes being a part of the public API can be imported and accessed directly using:

`` `python     from pytest import ExitCode  > **Note** >  If you would like to customize the exit code in some scenarios, specially when no tests are collected, consider using the `pytest-custom_exit_code <https://github.com/yashtodi94/pytest-custom_exit_code>`__ plugin. ``\`

## Built-in fixtures

\[Fixtures \<fixtures-api\>\](\#fixtures-\<fixtures-api\>) are defined using the \[@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture-api\>\](\#@pytest.fixture \<pytest.fixture-api\>) decorator. Pytest has several useful built-in fixtures:

>   - `capfd`  
>     Capture, as text, output to file descriptors `1` and `2`.
> 
>   - `capfdbinary`  
>     Capture, as bytes, output to file descriptors `1` and `2`.
> 
>   - `caplog`  
>     Control logging and access log entries.
> 
>   - `capsys`  
>     Capture, as text, output to `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`.
> 
>   - `capsysbinary`  
>     Capture, as bytes, output to `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr`.
> 
>   - `cache`  
>     Store and retrieve values across pytest runs.

>   - `tmp_path`  
>     Provide a <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path</span> object to a temporary directory which is unique to each test function.
> 
>   - `tmp_path_factory`  
>     Make session-scoped temporary directories and return <span class="title-ref">pathlib.Path</span> objects.

> 
>   - `tmpdir_factory`  
>     Make session-scoped temporary directories and return `py.path.local` objects; replaced by `tmp_path_factory`.

## Fixture availability<span id="conftest.py"></span>

Fixture availability is determined from the perspective of the test. A fixture is only available for tests to request if they are in the scope that fixture is defined in. If a fixture is defined inside a class, it can only be requested by tests inside that class. But if a fixture is defined inside the global scope of the module, then every test in that module, even if it's defined inside a class, can request it.

Similarly, a test can also only be affected by an autouse fixture if that test is in the same scope that autouse fixture is defined in (see \[autouse order\](\#autouse-order)).

A fixture can also request any other fixture, no matter where it's defined, so long as the test requesting them can see all fixtures involved.

For example, here's a test file with a fixture (`outer`) that requests a fixture (`inner`) from a scope it wasn't defined in:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_request\_different\_scope.py

</div>

From the tests' perspectives, they have no problem seeing each of the fixtures they're dependent on:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_request_different_scope.*)

So when they run, `outer` will have no problem finding `inner`, because pytest searched from the tests' perspectives.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The scope a fixture is defined in has no bearing on the order it will be instantiated in: the order is mandated by the logic described \[here \<fixture order\>\](\#here-\<fixture-order\>).

</div>

### `conftest.py`: sharing fixtures across multiple files

The `conftest.py` file serves as a means of providing fixtures for an entire directory. Fixtures defined in a `conftest.py` can be used by any test in that package without needing to import them (pytest will automatically discover them).

You can have multiple nested directories/packages containing your tests, and each directory can have its own `conftest.py` with its own fixtures, adding on to the ones provided by the `conftest.py` files in parent directories.

For example, given a test file structure like this:

    tests/
        __init__.py
    
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def order():
                return []
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def top(order, innermost):
                order.append("top")
    
        test_top.py
            # content of tests/test_top.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def innermost(order):
                order.append("innermost top")
    
            def test_order(order, top):
                assert order == ["innermost top", "top"]
    
        subpackage/
            __init__.py
    
            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/conftest.py
                import pytest
    
                @pytest.fixture
                def mid(order):
                    order.append("mid subpackage")
    
            test_subpackage.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py
                import pytest
    
                @pytest.fixture
                def innermost(order, mid):
                    order.append("innermost subpackage")
    
                def test_order(order, top):
                    assert order == ["mid subpackage", "innermost subpackage", "top"]

The boundaries of the scopes can be visualized like this:

![image](/example/fixtures/fixture_availability.*)

The directories become their own sort of scope where fixtures that are defined in a `conftest.py` file in that directory become available for that whole scope.

Tests are allowed to search upward (stepping outside a circle) for fixtures, but can never go down (stepping inside a circle) to continue their search. So `tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py::test_order` would be able to find the `innermost` fixture defined in `tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py`, but the one defined in `tests/test_top.py` would be unavailable to it because it would have to step down a level (step inside a circle) to find it.

The first fixture the test finds is the one that will be used, so \[fixtures can be overridden \<override fixtures\>\](\#fixtures-can-be-overridden-\<override-fixtures\>) if you need to change or extend what one does for a particular scope.

You can also use the `conftest.py` file to implement \[local per-directory plugins \<conftest.py plugins\>\](\#local-per-directory-plugins-\<conftest.py-plugins\>).

### Fixtures from third-party plugins

Fixtures don't have to be defined in this structure to be available for tests, though. They can also be provided by third-party plugins that are installed, and this is how many pytest plugins operate. As long as those plugins are installed, the fixtures they provide can be requested from anywhere in your test suite.

Because they're provided from outside the structure of your test suite, third-party plugins don't really provide a scope like <span class="title-ref">conftest.py</span> files and the directories in your test suite do. As a result, pytest will search for fixtures stepping out through scopes as explained previously, only reaching fixtures defined in plugins *last*.

For example, given the following file structure:

    tests/
        __init__.py
    
        conftest.py
            # content of tests/conftest.py
            import pytest
    
            @pytest.fixture
            def order():
                return []
    
        subpackage/
            __init__.py
    
            conftest.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/conftest.py
                import pytest
    
                @pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
                def mid(order, b_fix):
                    order.append("mid subpackage")
    
            test_subpackage.py
                # content of tests/subpackage/test_subpackage.py
                import pytest
    
                @pytest.fixture
                def inner(order, mid, a_fix):
                    order.append("inner subpackage")
    
                def test_order(order, inner):
                    assert order == ["b_fix", "mid subpackage", "a_fix", "inner subpackage"]

If `plugin_a` is installed and provides the fixture `a_fix`, and `plugin_b` is installed and provides the fixture `b_fix`, then this is what the test's search for fixtures would look like:

![image](/example/fixtures/fixture_availability_plugins.svg)

pytest will only search for `a_fix` and `b_fix` in the plugins after searching for them first in the scopes inside `tests/`.

## Fixture instantiation order

When pytest wants to execute a test, once it knows what fixtures will be executed, it has to figure out the order they'll be executed in. To do this, it considers 3 factors:

1.  scope
2.  dependencies
3.  autouse

Names of fixtures or tests, where they're defined, the order they're defined in, and the order fixtures are requested in have no bearing on execution order beyond coincidence. While pytest will try to make sure coincidences like these stay consistent from run to run, it's not something that should be depended on. If you want to control the order, it's safest to rely on these 3 things and make sure dependencies are clearly established.

### Higher-scoped fixtures are executed first

Within a function request for fixtures, those of higher-scopes (such as `session`) are executed before lower-scoped fixtures (such as `function` or `class`).

Here's an example:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_order\_scope.py

</div>

The test will pass because the larger scoped fixtures are executing first.

The order breaks down to this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_scope.*)

### Fixtures of the same order execute based on dependencies

When a fixture requests another fixture, the other fixture is executed first. So if fixture `a` requests fixture `b`, fixture `b` will execute first, because `a` depends on `b` and can't operate without it. Even if `a` doesn't need the result of `b`, it can still request `b` if it needs to make sure it is executed after `b`.

For example:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_order\_dependencies.py

</div>

If we map out what depends on what, we get something that looks like this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies.*)

The rules provided by each fixture (as to what fixture(s) each one has to come after) are comprehensive enough that it can be flattened to this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies_flat.*)

Enough information has to be provided through these requests in order for pytest to be able to figure out a clear, linear chain of dependencies, and as a result, an order of operations for a given test. If there's any ambiguity, and the order of operations can be interpreted more than one way, you should assume pytest could go with any one of those interpretations at any point.

For example, if `d` didn't request `c`, i.e.the graph would look like this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_dependencies_unclear.*)

Because nothing requested `c` other than `g`, and `g` also requests `f`, it's now unclear if `c` should go before/after `f`, `e`, or `d`. The only rules that were set for `c` is that it must execute after `b` and before `g`.

pytest doesn't know where `c` should go in the case, so it should be assumed that it could go anywhere between `g` and `b`.

This isn't necessarily bad, but it's something to keep in mind. If the order they execute in could affect the behavior a test is targeting, or could otherwise influence the result of a test, then the order should be defined explicitly in a way that allows pytest to linearize/"flatten" that order.

### Autouse fixtures are executed first within their scope

Autouse fixtures are assumed to apply to every test that could reference them, so they are executed before other fixtures in that scope. Fixtures that are requested by autouse fixtures effectively become autouse fixtures themselves for the tests that the real autouse fixture applies to.

So if fixture `a` is autouse and fixture `b` is not, but fixture `a` requests fixture `b`, then fixture `b` will effectively be an autouse fixture as well, but only for the tests that `a` applies to.

In the last example, the graph became unclear if `d` didn't request `c`. But if `c` was autouse, then `b` and `a` would effectively also be autouse because `c` depends on them. As a result, they would all be shifted above non-autouse fixtures within that scope.

So if the test file looked like this:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_order\_autouse.py

</div>

the graph would look like this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse.*)

Because `c` can now be put above `d` in the graph, pytest can once again linearize the graph to this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_flat.*)

In this example, `c` makes `b` and `a` effectively autouse fixtures as well.

Be careful with autouse, though, as an autouse fixture will automatically execute for every test that can reach it, even if they don't request it. For example, consider this file:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_order\_autouse\_multiple\_scopes.py

</div>

Even though nothing in `TestClassWithoutC1Request` is requesting `c1`, it still is executed for the tests inside it anyway:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_multiple_scopes.*)

But just because one autouse fixture requested a non-autouse fixture, that doesn't mean the non-autouse fixture becomes an autouse fixture for all contexts that it can apply to. It only effectively becomes an autouse fixture for the contexts the real autouse fixture (the one that requested the non-autouse fixture) can apply to.

For example, take a look at this test file:

<div class="literalinclude">

/example/fixtures/test\_fixtures\_order\_autouse\_temp\_effects.py

</div>

It would break down to something like this:

![image](/example/fixtures/test_fixtures_order_autouse_temp_effects.*)

For `test_req` and `test_no_req` inside `TestClassWithAutouse`, `c3` effectively makes `c2` an autouse fixture, which is why `c2` and `c3` are executed for both tests, despite not being requested, and why `c2` and `c3` are executed before `c1` for `test_req`.

If this made `c2` an *actual* autouse fixture, then `c2` would also execute for the tests inside `TestClassWithoutAutouse`, since they can reference `c2` if they wanted to. But it doesn't, because from the perspective of the `TestClassWithoutAutouse` tests, `c2` isn't an autouse fixture, since they can't see `c3`.

## Marks

Marks can be used to apply metadata to *test functions* (but not fixtures), which can then be accessed by fixtures or plugins.

### pytest.mark.filterwarnings

**Tutorial**: \[filterwarnings\](\#filterwarnings)

Add warning filters to marked test items.

<div id="pytest.mark.parametrize ref">

pytest.mark.parametrize `` ` ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Tutorial**: [parametrize](#parametrize)  This mark has the same signature as :py`pytest.Metafunc.parametrize`; see there.   .. _`pytest.mark.skip ref`:  pytest.mark.skip ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Tutorial**: [skip](#skip)  Unconditionally skip a test function.  .. py:function:: pytest.mark.skip(reason=None)      :keyword str reason: Reason why the test function is being skipped.   .. _`pytest.mark.skipif ref`:  pytest.mark.skipif ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Tutorial**: [skipif](#skipif)  Skip a test function if a condition is ``True`.  .. py:function:: pytest.mark.skipif(condition, *, reason=None)      :type condition: bool or str     :param condition:`True/False``if the condition should be skipped or a [condition string <string conditions>](#condition-string-<string-conditions>).     :keyword str reason: Reason why the test function is being skipped.   .. _`pytest.mark.usefixtures ref`:  pytest.mark.usefixtures ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Tutorial**: [usefixtures](#usefixtures)  Mark a test function as using the given fixture names.  .. py:function:: pytest.mark.usefixtures(*names)      :param args: The names of the fixture to use, as strings.  > **Note** >      When using `usefixtures` in hooks, it can only load fixtures when applied to a test function before test setup     (for example in the `pytest_collection_modifyitems` hook).      Also note that this mark has no effect when applied to **fixtures**.    .. _`pytest.mark.xfail ref`:  pytest.mark.xfail ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  **Tutorial**: [xfail](#xfail)  Marks a test function as *expected to fail*.  .. py:function:: pytest.mark.xfail(condition=False, *, reason=None, raises=None, run=True, strict=xfail_strict)      :keyword Union[bool, str] condition:         Condition for marking the test function as xfail (``True/False`or a         [condition string <string conditions>](#condition-string-<string-conditions>)). If a`bool`, you also have         to specify`reason`(see [condition string <string conditions>](#condition-string-<string-conditions>)).     :keyword str reason:         Reason why the test function is marked as xfail.     :keyword raises:         Exception class (or tuple of classes) expected to be raised by the test function; other exceptions will fail the test.         Note that subclasses of the classes passed will also result in a match (similar to how the`except``statement works).     :type raises: Type[:py`Exception`]      :keyword bool run:         Whether the test function should actually be executed. If``False`, the function will always xfail and will         not be executed (useful if a function is segfaulting).     :keyword bool strict:         * If`False`the function will be shown in the terminal output as`xfailed`if it fails           and as`xpass`if it passes. In both cases this will not cause the test suite to fail as a whole. This           is particularly useful to mark *flaky* tests (tests that fail at random) to be tackled later.         * If`True`, the function will be shown in the terminal output as`xfailed``if it fails, but if it           unexpectedly passes then it will **fail** the test suite. This is particularly useful to mark functions           that are always failing and there should be a clear indication if they unexpectedly start to pass (for example           a new release of a library fixes a known bug).          Defaults to :confval:`xfail_strict`, which is``False`by default.   Custom marks ~~~~~~~~~~~~  Marks are created dynamically using the factory object`pytest.mark`and applied as a decorator.  For example:`\`python @pytest.mark.timeout(10, "slow", method="thread") def test\_function(): ...

</div>

Will create and attach a <span class="title-ref">Mark \<pytest.Mark\></span> object to the collected `` ` `Item <pytest.Item>`, which can then be accessed by fixtures or hooks with `Node.iter_markers <_pytest.nodes.Node.iter_markers>`. The ``mark`object will have the following attributes:`\`python mark.args == (10, "slow") mark.kwargs == {"method": "thread"}

Example for using multiple custom markers:

``` python
@pytest.mark.timeout(10, "slow", method="thread")
@pytest.mark.slow
def test_function(): ...
```

When <span class="title-ref">Node.iter\_markers \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.iter\_markers\></span> or <span class="title-ref">Node.iter\_markers\_with\_node \<\_pytest.nodes.Node.iter\_markers\_with\_node\></span> is used with multiple markers, the marker closest to the function will be iterated over first. The above example will result in `@pytest.mark.slow` followed by `@pytest.mark.timeout(...)`.

<div id="fixtures-api">

Fixtures `` ` --------  **Tutorial**: [fixture](#fixture)  Fixtures are requested by test functions or other fixtures by declaring them as argument names.   Example of a test requiring a fixture: ``\`python def test\_output(capsys): print("hello") out, err = capsys.readouterr() assert out == "hellon"

</div>

Example of a fixture requiring another fixture:

``` python
@pytest.fixture
def db_session(tmp_path):
    fn = tmp_path / "db.file"
    return connect(fn)
```

Environment Variables `` ` ---------------------  Environment variables that can be used to change pytest's behavior.  .. envvar:: CI  When set (regardless of value), pytest acknowledges that is running in a CI process. Alternative to ``BUILD\_NUMBER``variable. See also [ci-pipelines](#ci-pipelines).  .. envvar:: BUILD_NUMBER  When set (regardless of value), pytest acknowledges that is running in a CI process. Alternative to CI variable. See also [ci-pipelines](#ci-pipelines).  .. envvar:: PYTEST_ADDOPTS  This contains a command-line (parsed by the py:mod:`shlex` module) that will be **prepended** to the command line given by the user, see [adding default options](#adding-default-options) for more information.  .. envvar:: PYTEST_VERSION  This environment variable is defined at the start of the pytest session and is undefined afterwards. It contains the value of``pytest.\_\_version\_\_``, and among other things can be used to easily check if a code is running from within a pytest run.  .. envvar:: PYTEST_CURRENT_TEST  This is not meant to be set by users, but is set by pytest internally with the name of the current test so other processes can inspect it, see [pytest current test env](#pytest-current-test-env) for more information.  .. envvar:: PYTEST_DEBUG  When set, pytest will print tracing and debug information.  .. envvar:: PYTEST_DEBUG_TEMPROOT  Root for temporary directories produced by fixtures like :fixture:`tmp_path` as discussed in [temporary directory location and retention](#temporary-directory-location-and-retention).  .. envvar:: PYTEST_DISABLE_PLUGIN_AUTOLOAD  When set, disables plugin auto-loading through :std[entry point packaging metadata <packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins>](entry point packaging metadata <packaging:guides/creating-and-discovering-plugins>.md). Only explicitly specified plugins will be loaded.  .. envvar:: PYTEST_PLUGINS  Contains comma-separated list of modules that should be loaded as plugins:``\`bash export PYTEST\_PLUGINS=mymodule.plugin,xdist

To see each file format in details, see [config file formats](#config-file-formats).  .. warning::     Usage of`setup.cfg`is not recommended except for very simple use cases.`.cfg`files use a different parser than`pytest.ini`and`tox.ini`which might cause hard to track     down problems.     When possible, it is recommended to use the latter files, or`pyproject.toml`, to hold your pytest configuration.  Configuration options may be overwritten in the command-line by using`-o/--override-ini`, which can also be passed multiple times. The expected format is`name=value`. For example::     pytest -o console_output_style=classic -o cache_dir=/tmp/mycache   .. confval:: addopts     Add the specified`OPTS`to the set of command line arguments as if they    had been specified by the user. Example: if you have this ini file content:`\`ini \# content of pytest.ini \[pytest\] addopts = --maxfail=2 -rf \# exit after 2 failures, report fail info

> issuing `pytest test_hello.py` actually means:
> 
> ``` bash
> pytest --maxfail=2 -rf test_hello.py
> ```
> 
> Default is to add no options.

<div class="confval">

cache\_dir

Sets the directory where the cache plugin's content is stored. Default directory is `.pytest_cache` which is created in \[rootdir \<rootdir\>\](\#rootdir-\<rootdir\>). Directory may be relative or absolute path. If setting relative path, then directory is created relative to \[rootdir \<rootdir\>\](\#rootdir-\<rootdir\>). Additionally, a path may contain environment variables, that will be expanded. For more information about cache plugin please refer to \[cache\_provider\](\#cache\_provider).

</div>

<div class="confval">

consider\_namespace\_packages

Controls if pytest should attempt to identify [namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages) when collecting Python modules. Default is `False`.

Set to `True` if the package you are testing is part of a namespace package.

Only [native namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#native-namespace-packages) are supported, with no plans to support [legacy namespace packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/#legacy-namespace-packages).

<div class="versionadded">

8.1

</div>

</div>

<div class="confval">

console\_output\_style

Sets the console output style while running tests:

  - `classic`: classic pytest output.
  - `progress`: like classic pytest output, but with a progress indicator.
  - `progress-even-when-capture-no`: allows the use of the progress indicator even when `capture=no`.
  - `count`: like progress, but shows progress as the number of tests completed instead of a percent.

The default is `progress`, but you can fallback to `classic` if you prefer or the new mode is causing unexpected problems:

``` ini
# content of pytest.ini
[pytest]
console_output_style = classic
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

disable\_test\_id\_escaping\_and\_forfeit\_all\_rights\_to\_community\_support

<div class="versionadded">

4.4

</div>

pytest by default escapes any non-ascii characters used in unicode strings for the parametrization because it has several downsides. If however you would like to use unicode strings in parametrization and see them in the terminal as is (non-escaped), use this option in your `pytest.ini`:

``` ini
[pytest]
disable_test_id_escaping_and_forfeit_all_rights_to_community_support = True
```

Keep in mind however that this might cause unwanted side effects and even bugs depending on the OS used and plugins currently installed, so use it at your own risk.

Default: `False`.

See \[parametrizemark\](\#parametrizemark).

</div>

<div class="confval">

doctest\_encoding

Default encoding to use to decode text files with docstrings. \[See how pytest handles doctests \<doctest\>\](\#see-how-pytest-handles-doctests-\<doctest\>).

</div>

<div class="confval">

doctest\_optionflags

One or more doctest flag names from the standard `doctest` module. \[See how pytest handles doctests \<doctest\>\](\#see-how-pytest-handles-doctests-\<doctest\>).

</div>

<div class="confval">

empty\_parameter\_set\_mark

Allows to pick the action for empty parametersets in parameterization

  - `skip` skips tests with an empty parameterset (default)
  - `xfail` marks tests with an empty parameterset as xfail(run=False)
  - `fail_at_collect` raises an exception if parametrize collects an empty parameter set

<!-- end list -->

``` ini
# content of pytest.ini
[pytest]
empty_parameter_set_mark = xfail
```

\> **Note**

</div>

  - \>  
    The default value of this option is planned to change to `xfail` in future releases as this is considered less error prone, see `3155` for more details.

<div class="confval">

faulthandler\_timeout

Dumps the tracebacks of all threads if a test takes longer than `X` seconds to run (including fixture setup and teardown). Implemented using the <span class="title-ref">faulthandler.dump\_traceback\_later</span> function, so all caveats there apply.

``` ini
# content of pytest.ini
[pytest]
faulthandler_timeout=5
```

For more information please refer to \[faulthandler\](\#faulthandler).

</div>

<div class="confval">

filterwarnings

Sets a list of filters and actions that should be taken for matched warnings. By default all warnings emitted during the test session will be displayed in a summary at the end of the test session.

``` ini
# content of pytest.ini
[pytest]
filterwarnings =
    error
    ignore::DeprecationWarning
```

This tells pytest to ignore deprecation warnings and turn all other warnings into errors. For more information please refer to \[warnings\](\#warnings).

</div>

<div class="confval">

junit\_duration\_report

<div class="versionadded">

4.1

</div>

Configures how durations are recorded into the JUnit XML report:

<!-- end list -->

``` ini
[pytest]
junit_duration_report = call
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

junit\_family

<div class="versionadded">

4.2

</div>

<div class="versionchanged">

6.1 Default changed to `xunit2`.

</div>

Configures the format of the generated JUnit XML file. The possible options are:

  - `xunit1` (or `legacy`): produces old style output, compatible with the xunit 1.0 format.
  - `xunit2`: produces [xunit 2.0 style output](https://github.com/jenkinsci/xunit-plugin/blob/xunit-2.3.2/src/main/resources/org/jenkinsci/plugins/xunit/types/model/xsd/junit-10.xsd), which should be more compatible with latest Jenkins versions. **This is the default**.

junit\_logging

<div class="versionadded">

3.5

</div>

<div class="versionchanged">

5.4 `log`, `all`, `out-err` options added.

Configures if captured output should be written to the JUnit XML file. Valid values are:

  - `log`: write only `logging` captured output.
  - `system-out`: write captured `stdout` contents.
  - `system-err`: write captured `stderr` contents.
  - `out-err`: write both captured `stdout` and `stderr` contents.
  - `all`: write captured `logging`, `stdout` and `stderr` contents.

If `junit_logging != "no"`, configures if the captured output should be written to the JUnit XML file for **passing** tests. Default is `True`.

``` ini
[pytest]
junit_log_passing_tests = False
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

junit\_suite\_name

To set the name of the root test suite xml item, you can configure the `junit_suite_name` option in your config file:

``` ini
[pytest]
junit_suite_name = my_suite
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

log\_auto\_indent

Allow selective auto-indentation of multiline log messages.

Supports command line option `--log-auto-indent [value]` and config option `log_auto_indent = [value]` to set the auto-indentation behavior for all logging.

  - `[value]` can be:
    
      - True or "On" - Dynamically auto-indent multiline log messages
      - False or "Off" or 0 - Do not auto-indent multiline log messages (the default behavior)
      - \[positive integer\] - auto-indent multiline log messages by \[value\] spaces

<!-- end list -->

``` ini
[pytest]
log_auto_indent = False
```

Supports passing kwarg `extra={"auto_indent": [value]}` to calls to `logging.log()` to specify auto-indentation behavior for a specific entry in the log. `extra` kwarg overrides the value specified on the command line or in the config.

<div class="confval">

log\_file\_level

Sets the minimum log message level that should be captured for the logging file. The integer value or the names of the levels can be used.

``` ini
[pytest]
log_file_level = INFO
```

For more information, see \[logging\](\#logging).

</div>

<div class="confval">

log\_format

Sets a :py`logging`-compatible string used to format captured logging messages.

<div class="confval">

markers

When the `--strict-markers` or `--strict` command-line arguments are used, only known markers - defined in code by core pytest or some plugin - are allowed.

You can list additional markers in this setting to add them to the whitelist, in which case you probably want to add `--strict-markers` to `addopts` to avoid future regressions:

``` ini
[pytest]
addopts = --strict-markers
markers =
    slow
    serial
```

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The use of `--strict-markers` is highly preferred. `--strict` was kept for backward compatibility only and may be confusing for others as it only applies to markers and not to other options.

</div>

</div>

<div class="confval">

minversion

Specifies a minimal pytest version required for running tests.

``` ini
# content of pytest.ini
[pytest]
minversion = 3.0  # will fail if we run with pytest-2.8
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

norecursedirs

Set the directory basename patterns to avoid when recursing for test discovery. The individual (fnmatch-style) patterns are applied to the basename of a directory to decide if to recurse into it. Pattern matching characters:

    *       matches everything
    ?       matches any single character
    [seq]   matches any character in seq
    [!seq]  matches any char not in seq

Default patterns are `'*.egg'`, `'.*'`, `'_darcs'`, `'build'`, `'CVS'`, `'dist'`, `'node_modules'`, `'venv'`, `'{arch}'`. Setting a `norecursedirs` replaces the default. Here is an example of how to avoid certain directories:

``` ini
[pytest]
norecursedirs = .svn _build tmp*
```

This would tell `pytest` to not look into typical subversion or sphinx-build directories or into any `tmp` prefixed directory.

Additionally, `pytest` will attempt to intelligently identify and ignore a virtualenv. Any directory deemed to be the root of a virtual environment will not be considered during test collection unless `--collect-in-virtualenv` is given. Note also that `norecursedirs` takes precedence over `--collect-in-virtualenv`; e.g. if you intend to run tests in a virtualenv with a base directory that matches `'.*'` you *must* override `norecursedirs` in addition to using the `--collect-in-virtualenv` flag.

</div>

<div class="confval">

python\_classes

One or more name prefixes or glob-style patterns determining which classes are considered for test collection. Search for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between patterns. By default, pytest will consider any class prefixed with `Test` as a test collection. Here is an example of how to collect tests from classes that end in `Suite`:

``` ini
[pytest]
python_classes = *Suite
```

Note that `unittest.TestCase` derived classes are always collected regardless of this option, as `unittest`'s own collection framework is used to collect those tests.

</div>

<div class="confval">

python\_files

One or more Glob-style file patterns determining which python files are considered as test modules. Search for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between patterns:

``` ini
[pytest]
python_files = test_*.py check_*.py example_*.py
```

Or one per line:

``` ini
[pytest]
python_files =
    test_*.py
    check_*.py
    example_*.py
```

By default, files matching `test_*.py` and `*_test.py` will be considered test modules.

</div>

<div class="confval">

python\_functions

One or more name prefixes or glob-patterns determining which test functions and methods are considered tests. Search for multiple glob patterns by adding a space between patterns. By default, pytest will consider any function prefixed with `test` as a test. Here is an example of how to collect test functions and methods that end in `_test`:

``` ini
[pytest]
python_functions = *_test
```

Note that this has no effect on methods that live on a `unittest.TestCase` derived class, as `unittest`'s own collection framework is used to collect those tests.

See \[change naming conventions\](\#change-naming-conventions) for more detailed examples.

</div>

<div class="confval">

pythonpath

Sets list of directories that should be added to the python search path. Directories will be added to the head of <span class="title-ref">sys.path</span>. Similar to the `PYTHONPATH` environment variable, the directories will be included in where Python will look for imported modules. Paths are relative to the \[rootdir \<rootdir\>\](\#rootdir-\<rootdir\>) directory. Directories remain in path for the duration of the test session.

``` ini
[pytest]
pythonpath = src1 src2
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

required\_plugins

A space separated list of plugins that must be present for pytest to run. Plugins can be listed with or without version specifiers directly following their name. Whitespace between different version specifiers is not allowed. If any one of the plugins is not found, emit an error.

``` ini
[pytest]
required_plugins = pytest-django>=3.0.0,<4.0.0 pytest-html pytest-xdist>=1.0.0
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

testpaths

Sets list of directories that should be searched for tests when no specific directories, files or test ids are given in the command line when executing pytest from the \[rootdir \<rootdir\>\](\#rootdir-\<rootdir\>) directory. File system paths may use shell-style wildcards, including the recursive `**` pattern.

Useful when all project tests are in a known location to speed up test collection and to avoid picking up undesired tests by accident.

``` ini
[pytest]
testpaths = testing doc
```

This configuration means that executing:

``` console
pytest
```

has the same practical effects as executing:

``` console
pytest testing doc
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

tmp\_path\_retention\_count

How many sessions should we keep the <span class="title-ref">tmp\_path</span> directories, according to <span class="title-ref">tmp\_path\_retention\_policy</span>.

``` ini
[pytest]
tmp_path_retention_count = 3
```

Default: `3`

</div>

<div class="confval">

tmp\_path\_retention\_policy

Controls which directories created by the <span class="title-ref">tmp\_path</span> fixture are kept around, based on test outcome.

>   - \`all\`: retains directories for all tests, regardless of the outcome.
>   - \`failed\`: retains directories only for tests with outcome <span class="title-ref">error</span> or <span class="title-ref">failed</span>.
>   - \`none\`: directories are always removed after each test ends, regardless of the outcome.

``` ini
[pytest]
tmp_path_retention_policy = all
```

Default: `all`

</div>

<div class="confval">

truncation\_limit\_chars

Controls maximum number of characters to truncate assertion message contents.

Setting value to `0` disables the character limit for truncation.

``` ini
[pytest]
truncation_limit_chars = 640
```

pytest truncates the assert messages to a certain limit by default to prevent comparison with large data to overload the console output.

Default: `640`

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If pytest detects it is \[running on CI \<ci-pipelines\>\](\#running-on-ci-\<ci-pipelines\>), truncation is disabled automatically.

</div>

</div>

<div class="confval">

truncation\_limit\_lines

Controls maximum number of linesto truncate assertion message contents.

Setting value to `0` disables the lines limit for truncation.

``` ini
[pytest]
truncation_limit_lines = 8
```

pytest truncates the assert messages to a certain limit by default to prevent comparison with large data to overload the console output.

Default: `8`

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If pytest detects it is \[running on CI \<ci-pipelines\>\](\#running-on-ci-\<ci-pipelines\>), truncation is disabled automatically.

</div>

</div>

<div class="confval">

usefixtures

List of fixtures that will be applied to all test functions; this is semantically the same to apply the `@pytest.mark.usefixtures` marker to all test functions.

``` ini
[pytest]
usefixtures =
    clean_db
```

</div>

<div class="confval">

verbosity\_assertions

Set a verbosity level specifically for assertion related output, overriding the application wide level.

``` ini
[pytest]
verbosity_assertions = 2
```

Defaults to application wide verbosity level (via the `-v` command-line option). A special value of "auto" can be used to explicitly use the global verbosity level.

</div>

<div class="confval">

verbosity\_test\_cases

Set a verbosity level specifically for test case execution related output, overriding the application wide level.

``` ini
[pytest]
verbosity_test_cases = 2
```

Defaults to application wide verbosity level (via the `-v` command-line option). A special value of "auto" can be used to explicitly use the global verbosity level.

</div>

<div class="confval">

xfail\_strict

If set to `True`, tests marked with `@pytest.mark.xfail` that actually succeed will by default fail the test suite. For more information, see \[xfail strict tutorial\](\#xfail-strict-tutorial).

``` ini
[pytest]
xfail_strict = True
```

</div>

<div id="command-line-flags">

Command-line Flags `` ` ------------------  All the command-line flags can be obtained by running ``pytest --help`::      $ pytest --help     usage: pytest [options] [file_or_dir] [file_or_dir] [...]      positional arguments:       file_or_dir      general:       -k EXPRESSION         Only run tests which match the given substring                             expression. An expression is a Python evaluable                             expression where all names are substring-matched                             against test names and their parent classes.                             Example: -k 'test_method or test_other' matches all                             test functions and classes whose name contains                             'test_method' or 'test_other', while -k 'not                             test_method' matches those that don't contain                             'test_method' in their names. -k 'not test_method                             and not test_other' will eliminate the matches.                             Additionally keywords are matched to classes and                             functions containing extra names in their                             'extra_keyword_matches' set, as well as functions                             which have names assigned directly to them. The                             matching is case-insensitive.       -m MARKEXPR           Only run tests matching given mark expression.

# Sponsor

pytest is maintained by a team of volunteers from all around the world in their free time. While we work on pytest because we love the project and use it daily at our daily jobs, monetary compensation when possible is welcome to justify time away from friends, family and personal time.

Money is also used to fund local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example) and every few years a large sprint involving all members.

## OpenCollective

[Open Collective](https://opencollective.com) is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities. It provide tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

It is the platform of choice for individuals and companies that want to make one-time or monthly donations directly to the project.

# pytest for enterprise

[Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) is working with the maintainers of pytest and thousands of other open source projects to deliver commercial support and maintenance for the open source dependencies you use to build your applications. Save time, reduce risk, and improve code health, while paying the maintainers of the exact dependencies you use.

[Get more details](https://tidelift.com/subscription/pkg/pypi-pytest?utm_source=pypi-pytest&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign=enterprise)

The Tidelift Subscription is a managed open source subscription for application dependencies covering millions of open source projects across JavaScript, Python, Java, PHP, Ruby, .NET, and more.

Your subscription includes:

  - **Security updates**
      - Tidelift's security response team coordinates patches for new breaking security vulnerabilities and alerts immediately through a private channel, so your software supply chain is always secure.
  - **Licensing verification and indemnification**
      - Tidelift verifies license information to enable easy policy enforcement and adds intellectual property indemnification to cover creators and users in case something goes wrong. You always have a 100% up-to-date bill of materials for your dependencies to share with your legal team, customers, or partners.
  - **Maintenance and code improvement**
      - Tidelift ensures the software you rely on keeps working as long as you need it to work. Your managed dependencies are actively maintained and we recruit additional maintainers where required.
  - **Package selection and version guidance**
      - Tidelift helps you choose the best open source packages from the start—and then guide you through updates to stay on the best releases as new issues arise.
  - **Roadmap input**
      - Take a seat at the table with the creators behind the software you use. Tidelift's participating maintainers earn more income as their software is used by more subscribers, so they're interested in knowing what you need.
  - **Tooling and cloud integration**
      - Tidelift works with GitHub, GitLab, BitBucket, and every cloud platform (and other deployment targets, too).

The end result? All of the capabilities you expect from commercial-grade software, for the full breadth of open source you use. That means less time grappling with esoteric open source trivia, and more time building your own applications—and your business.

# "yield\_fixture" functions

<div class="important">

<div class="title">

Important

</div>

Since pytest-3.0, fixtures using the normal `fixture` decorator can use a `yield` statement to provide fixture values and execute teardown code, exactly like `yield_fixture` in previous versions.

Marking functions as `yield_fixture` is still supported, but deprecated and should not be used in new code.

Contributing
============

Contributions are highly welcomed and appreciated. Every little bit of help counts, so do not hesitate!

Feature requests and feedback {#submitfeedback}
-----------------------------

Do you like pytest? Share some love on Twitter or in your blog posts!

We\'d also like to hear about your propositions and suggestions. Feel free to [submit them as issues](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues) and:

-   Explain in detail how they should work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible. This will make it easier to implement.

Report bugs {#reportbugs}
-----------

Report bugs for pytest in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues).

If you are reporting a bug, please include:

-   Your operating system name and version.
-   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting, specifically the Python interpreter version, installed libraries, and pytest version.
-   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

If you can write a demonstration test that currently fails but should pass (xfail), that is a very useful commit to make as well, even if you cannot fix the bug itself.

Fix bugs {#fixbugs}
--------

Look through the [GitHub issues for bugs](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type:%20bug). See also the [\"good first issue\" issues](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/good%20first%20issue) that are friendly to new contributors.

`Talk <contact>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to developers to find out how you can fix specific bugs. To indicate that you are going to work on a particular issue, add a comment to that effect on the specific issue.

Don\'t forget to check the issue trackers of your favourite plugins, too!

Implement features {#writeplugins}
------------------

Look through the [GitHub issues for enhancements](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/labels/type:%20enhancement).

`Talk <contact>`{.interpreted-text role="ref"} to developers to find out how you can implement specific features.

Write documentation
-------------------

Pytest could always use more documentation. What exactly is needed?

-   More complementary documentation. Have you perhaps found something unclear?
-   Documentation translations. We currently have only English.
-   Docstrings. There can never be too many of them.
-   Blog posts, articles and such \-- they\'re all very appreciated.

You can also edit documentation files directly in the GitHub web interface, without using a local copy. This can be convenient for small fixes.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Build the documentation locally with the following command:

``` {.bash}
$ tox -e docs
```

The built documentation should be available in `doc/en/_build/html`, where \'en\' refers to the documentation language.
:::

Pytest has an API reference which in large part is [generated automatically](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/extensions/autodoc.html) from the docstrings of the documented items. Pytest uses the [Sphinx docstring format](https://sphinx-rtd-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/docstrings.html). For example:

``` {.python}
def my_function(arg: ArgType) -> Foo:
    """Do important stuff.

    More detailed info here, in separate paragraphs from the subject line.
    Use proper sentences -- start sentences with capital letters and end
    with periods.

    Can include annotated documentation:

    :param short_arg: An argument which determines stuff.
    :param long_arg:
        A long explanation which spans multiple lines, overflows
        like this.
    :returns: The result.
    :raises ValueError:
        Detailed information when this can happen.

    .. versionadded:: 6.0

    Including types into the annotations above is not necessary when
    type-hinting is being used (as in this example).
    """
```

Submitting Plugins to pytest-dev {#submitplugin}
--------------------------------

Development of the pytest core, support code, and some plugins happens in repositories living under the `pytest-dev` organisations:

-   [pytest-dev on GitHub](https://github.com/pytest-dev)

All pytest-dev Contributors team members have write access to all contained repositories. Pytest core and plugins are generally developed using [pull requests](#pull requests) to respective repositories.

The objectives of the `pytest-dev` organisation are:

-   Having a central location for popular pytest plugins
-   Sharing some of the maintenance responsibility (in case a maintainer no longer wishes to maintain a plugin)

You can submit your plugin by subscribing to the [pytest-dev mail list](https://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/pytest-dev) and writing a mail pointing to your existing pytest plugin repository which must have the following:

-   PyPI presence with packaging metadata that contains a `pytest-` prefixed name, version number, authors, short and long description.
-   a [tox configuration](https://tox.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#configuration-discovery) for running tests using [tox](https://tox.readthedocs.io).
-   a `README` describing how to use the plugin and on which platforms it runs.
-   a `LICENSE` file containing the licensing information, with matching info in its packaging metadata.
-   an issue tracker for bug reports and enhancement requests.
-   a [changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

If no contributor strongly objects and two agree, the repository can then be transferred to the `pytest-dev` organisation.

Here\'s a rundown of how a repository transfer usually proceeds (using a repository named `joedoe/pytest-xyz` as example):

-   `joedoe` transfers repository ownership to `pytest-dev` administrator `calvin`.
-   `calvin` creates `pytest-xyz-admin` and `pytest-xyz-developers` teams, inviting `joedoe` to both as **maintainer**.
-   `calvin` transfers repository to `pytest-dev` and configures team access:
    -   `pytest-xyz-admin` **admin** access;
    -   `pytest-xyz-developers` **write** access;

The `pytest-dev/Contributors` team has write access to all projects, and every project administrator is in it. We recommend that each plugin has at least three people who have the right to release to PyPI.

Repository owners can rest assured that no `pytest-dev` administrator will ever make releases of your repository or take ownership in any way, except in rare cases where someone becomes unresponsive after months of contact attempts. As stated, the objective is to share maintenance and avoid \"plugin-abandon\".

Preparing Pull Requests[]{#pull requests} {#pull-requests}
-----------------------------------------

### Short version

1.  Fork the repository.

2.  Fetch tags from upstream if necessary (if you cloned only main [git fetch \--tags https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest]{.title-ref}).

3.  Enable and install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) to ensure style-guides and code checks are followed.

4.  Follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for naming.

5.  Tests are run using `tox`:

        tox -e linting,py39

    The test environments above are usually enough to cover most cases locally.

6.  Write a `changelog` entry: `changelog/2574.bugfix.rst`, use issue id number and one of `feature`, `improvement`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `deprecation`, `breaking`, `vendor` or `trivial` for the issue type.

7.  Unless your change is a trivial or a documentation fix (e.g., a typo or reword of a small section) please add yourself to the `AUTHORS` file, in alphabetical order.

### Long version

What is a \"pull request\"? It informs the project\'s core developers about the changes you want to review and merge. Pull requests are stored on [GitHub servers](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/pulls). Once you send a pull request, we can discuss its potential modifications and even add more commits to it later on. There\'s an excellent tutorial on how Pull Requests work in the [GitHub Help Center](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests).

Here is a simple overview, with pytest-specific bits:

1.  Fork the [pytest GitHub repository](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest). It\'s fine to use `pytest` as your fork repository name because it will live under your user.

2.  Clone your fork locally using [git](https://git-scm.com/) and create a branch:

        $ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pytest.git
        $ cd pytest
        $ git fetch --tags https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
        # now, create your own branch off "main":

            $ git checkout -b your-bugfix-branch-name main

    Given we have \"major.minor.micro\" version numbers, bug fixes will usually be released in micro releases whereas features will be released in minor releases and incompatible changes in major releases.

    You will need the tags to test locally, so be sure you have the tags from the main repository. If you suspect you don\'t, set the main repository as upstream and fetch the tags:

        $ git remote add upstream https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest
        $ git fetch upstream --tags

    If you need some help with Git, follow this quick start guide: <https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/QuickStart>

3.  Install [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) and its hook on the pytest repo:

        $ pip install --user pre-commit
        $ pre-commit install

    Afterwards `pre-commit` will run whenever you commit.

    <https://pre-commit.com/> is a framework for managing and maintaining multi-language pre-commit hooks to ensure code-style and code formatting is consistent.

4.  Install tox

    Tox is used to run all the tests and will automatically setup virtualenvs to run the tests in. (will implicitly use <https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/>):

        $ pip install tox

5.  Run all the tests

    You need to have Python 3.8 or later available in your system. Now running tests is as simple as issuing this command:

        $ tox -e linting,py39

    This command will run tests via the \"tox\" tool against Python 3.9 and also perform \"lint\" coding-style checks.

6.  You can now edit your local working copy and run the tests again as necessary. Please follow [PEP-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) for naming.

    You can pass different options to `tox`. For example, to run tests on Python 3.9 and pass options to pytest (e.g. enter pdb on failure) to pytest you can do:

        $ tox -e py39 -- --pdb

    Or to only run tests in a particular test module on Python 3.9:

        $ tox -e py39 -- testing/test_config.py

    When committing, `pre-commit` will re-format the files if necessary.

7.  If instead of using `tox` you prefer to run the tests directly, then we suggest to create a virtual environment and use an editable install with the `dev` extra:

        $ python3 -m venv .venv
        $ source .venv/bin/activate  # Linux
        $ .venv/Scripts/activate.bat  # Windows
        $ pip install -e ".[dev]"

    Afterwards, you can edit the files and run pytest normally:

        $ pytest testing/test_config.py

8.  Create a new changelog entry in `changelog`. The file should be named `<issueid>.<type>.rst`, where *issueid* is the number of the issue related to the change and *type* is one of `feature`, `improvement`, `bugfix`, `doc`, `deprecation`, `breaking`, `vendor` or `trivial`. You may skip creating the changelog entry if the change doesn\'t affect the documented behaviour of pytest.

9.  Add yourself to `AUTHORS` file if not there yet, in alphabetical order.

10. Commit and push once your tests pass and you are happy with your change(s):

        $ git commit -a -m "<commit message>"
        $ git push -u

11. Finally, submit a pull request through the GitHub website using this data:

        head-fork: YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/pytest
        compare: your-branch-name

        base-fork: pytest-dev/pytest
        base: main

### Writing Tests

Writing tests for plugins or for pytest itself is often done using the [pytester fixture](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/reference/reference.html#pytester), as a \"black-box\" test.

For example, to ensure a simple test passes you can write:

``` {.python}
def test_true_assertion(pytester):
    pytester.makepyfile(
        """
        def test_foo():
            assert True
    """
    )
    result = pytester.runpytest()
    result.assert_outcomes(failed=0, passed=1)
```

Alternatively, it is possible to make checks based on the actual output of the termal using *glob-like* expressions:

``` {.python}
def test_true_assertion(pytester):
    pytester.makepyfile(
        """
        def test_foo():
            assert False
    """
    )
    result = pytester.runpytest()
    result.stdout.fnmatch_lines(["*assert False*", "*1 failed*"])
```

When choosing a file where to write a new test, take a look at the existing files and see if there\'s one file which looks like a good fit. For example, a regression test about a bug in the `--lf` option should go into `test_cacheprovider.py`, given that this option is implemented in `cacheprovider.py`. If in doubt, go ahead and open a PR with your best guess and we can discuss this over the code.

Joining the Development Team
----------------------------

Anyone who has successfully seen through a pull request which did not require any extra work from the development team to merge will themselves gain commit access if they so wish (if we forget to ask please send a friendly reminder). This does not mean there is any change in your contribution workflow: everyone goes through the same pull-request-and-review process and no-one merges their own pull requests unless already approved. It does however mean you can participate in the development process more fully since you can merge pull requests from other contributors yourself after having reviewed them.

Merge/squash guidelines
-----------------------

When a PR is approved and ready to be integrated to the `main` branch, one has the option to *merge* the commits unchanged, or *squash* all the commits into a single commit.

Here are some guidelines on how to proceed, based on examples of a single PR commit history:

1.  Miscellaneous commits:

    -   `Implement X`
    -   `Fix test_a`
    -   `Add myself to AUTHORS`
    -   `fixup! Fix test_a`
    -   `Update tests/test_integration.py`
    -   `Merge origin/main into PR branch`
    -   `Update tests/test_integration.py`

    In this case, prefer to use the **Squash** merge strategy: the commit history is a bit messy (not in a derogatory way, often one just commits changes because they know the changes will eventually be squashed together), so squashing everything into a single commit is best. You must clean up the commit message, making sure it contains useful details.

2.  Separate commits related to the same topic:

    -   `Implement X`
    -   `Add myself to AUTHORS`
    -   `Update CHANGELOG for X`

    In this case, prefer to use the **Squash** merge strategy: while the commit history is not \"messy\" as in the example above, the individual commits do not bring much value overall, specially when looking at the changes a few months/years down the line.

3.  Separate commits, each with their own topic (refactorings, renames, etc), but still have a larger topic/purpose.

    -   `Refactor class X in preparation for feature Y`
    -   `Remove unused method`
    -   `Implement feature Y`

    In this case, prefer to use the **Merge** strategy: each commit is valuable on its own, even if they serve a common topic overall. Looking at the history later, it is useful to have the removal of the unused method separately on its own commit, along with more information (such as how it became unused in the first place).

4.  Separate commits, each with their own topic, but without a larger topic/purpose other than improve the code base (using more modern techniques, improve typing, removing clutter, etc).

    -   `Improve internal names in X`
    -   `Add type annotations to Y`
    -   `Remove unnecessary dict access`
    -   `Remove unreachable code due to EOL Python`

    In this case, prefer to use the **Merge** strategy: each commit is valuable on its own, and the information on each is valuable in the long term.

As mentioned, those are overall guidelines, not rules cast in stone. This topic was discussed in [\#12633](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/discussions/12633).

*Backport PRs* (as those created automatically from a `backport` label) should always be **squashed**, as they preserve the original PR author.

Backporting bug fixes for the next patch release
------------------------------------------------

Pytest makes a feature release every few weeks or months. In between, patch releases are made to the previous feature release, containing bug fixes only. The bug fixes usually fix regressions, but may be any change that should reach users before the next feature release.

Suppose for example that the latest release was 1.2.3, and you want to include a bug fix in 1.2.4 (check <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/releases> for the actual latest release). The procedure for this is:

1.  First, make sure the bug is fixed in the `main` branch, with a regular pull request, as described above. An exception to this is if the bug fix is not applicable to `main` anymore.

Automatic method:

Add a `backport 1.2.x` label to the PR you want to backport. This will create a backport PR against the `1.2.x` branch.

Manual method:

1.  `git checkout origin/1.2.x -b backport-XXXX` \# use the main PR number here

2.  Locate the merge commit on the PR, in the *merged* message, for example:

    > nicoddemus merged commit 0f8b462 into pytest-dev:main

3.  `git cherry-pick -x -m1 REVISION` \# use the revision you found above (`0f8b462`).

4.  Open a PR targeting `1.2.x`:

    -   Prefix the message with `[1.2.x]`.
    -   Delete the PR body, it usually contains a duplicate commit message.

### Who does the backporting

As mentioned above, bugs should first be fixed on `main` (except in rare occasions that a bug only happens in a previous release). So, who should do the backport procedure described above?

1.  If the bug was fixed by a core developer, it is the main responsibility of that core developer to do the backport.
2.  However, often the merge is done by another maintainer, in which case it is nice of them to do the backport procedure if they have the time.
3.  For bugs submitted by non-maintainers, it is expected that a core developer will to do the backport, normally the one that merged the PR on `main`.
4.  If a non-maintainers notices a bug which is fixed on `main` but has not been backported (due to maintainers forgetting to apply the *needs backport* label, or just plain missing it), they are also welcome to open a PR with the backport. The procedure is simple and really helps with the maintenance of the project.

All the above are not rules, but merely some guidelines/suggestions on what we should expect about backports.

Backports should be **squashed** (rather than **merged**), as doing so preserves the original PR author correctly.

Handling stale issues/PRs
-------------------------

Stale issues/PRs are those where pytest contributors have asked for questions/changes and the authors didn\'t get around to answer/implement them yet after a somewhat long time, or the discussion simply died because people seemed to lose interest.

There are many reasons why people don\'t answer questions or implement requested changes: they might get busy, lose interest, or just forget about it, but the fact is that this is very common in open source software.

The pytest team really appreciates every issue and pull request, but being a high-volume project with many issues and pull requests being submitted daily, we try to reduce the number of stale issues and PRs by regularly closing them. When an issue/pull request is closed in this manner, it is by no means a dismissal of the topic being tackled by the issue/pull request, but it is just a way for us to clear up the queue and make the maintainers\' work more manageable. Submitters can always reopen the issue/pull request in their own time later if it makes sense.

### When to close

Here are a few general rules the maintainers use deciding when to close issues/PRs because of lack of inactivity:

-   Issues labeled `question` or `needs information`: closed after 14 days inactive.
-   Issues labeled `proposal`: closed after six months inactive.
-   Pull requests: after one month, consider pinging the author, update linked issue, or consider closing. For pull requests which are nearly finished, the team should consider finishing it up and merging it.

The above are **not hard rules**, but merely **guidelines**, and can be (and often are!) reviewed on a case-by-case basis.

### Closing pull requests

When closing a Pull Request, it needs to be acknowledging the time, effort, and interest demonstrated by the person which submitted it. As mentioned previously, it is not the intent of the team to dismiss a stalled pull request entirely but to merely to clear up our queue, so a message like the one below is warranted when closing a pull request that went stale:

> Hi \<contributor\>,
>
> First of all, we would like to thank you for your time and effort on working on this, the pytest team deeply appreciates it.
>
> We noticed it has been awhile since you have updated this PR, however. pytest is a high activity project, with many issues/PRs being opened daily, so it is hard for us maintainers to track which PRs are ready for merging, for review, or need more attention.
>
> So for those reasons we, think it is best to close the PR for now, but with the only intention to clean up our queue, it is by no means a rejection of your changes. We still encourage you to re-open this PR (it is just a click of a button away) when you are ready to get back to it.
>
> Again we appreciate your time for working on this, and hope you might get back to this at a later time!
>
> \<bye\>

Closing issues
--------------

When a pull request is submitted to fix an issue, add text like `closes #XYZW` to the PR description and/or commits (where `XYZW` is the issue number). See the [GitHub docs](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue#linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue-using-a-keyword) for more information.

When an issue is due to user error (e.g. misunderstanding of a functionality), please politely explain to the user why the issue raised is really a non-issue and ask them to close the issue if they have no further questions. If the original requester is unresponsive, the issue will be handled as described in the section [Handling stale issues/PRs](#handling-stale-issuesprs) above.

OPENCOLLECTIVE.rst

---

OpenCollective
==============

pytest has a collective setup at [OpenCollective](https://opencollective.com/pytest). This document describes how the core team manages OpenCollective-related activities.

What is it
----------

Open Collective is an online funding platform for open and transparent communities. It provides tools to raise money and share your finances in full transparency.

It is the platform of choice for individuals and companies that want to make one-time or monthly donations directly to the project.

Funds
-----

The OpenCollective funds donated to pytest will be used to fund overall maintenance, local sprints, merchandising (stickers to distribute in conferences for example), and future gatherings of pytest developers (sprints).

[Core contributors](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/core/members) which are contributing on a continuous basis are free to submit invoices to bill maintenance hours using the platform. How much each contributor should request is still an open question, but we should use common sense and trust in the contributors, most of which know themselves in-person. A good rule of thumb is to bill the same amount as monthly payments contributors which participate in the [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) subscription. If in doubt, just ask.

Admins
------

A few people have admin access to the OpenCollective dashboard to make changes. Those people are part of the [\@pytest-dev/opencollective-admins](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/opencollective-admins/members) team.

[Core contributors](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/core/members) interested in helping out with OpenCollective maintenance are welcome! We don\'t expect much work here other than the occasional approval of expenses from other core contributors. Just drop a line to one of the [\@pytest-dev/opencollective-admins](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/opencollective-admins/members) or use the mailing list.

The `pytest` framework makes it easy to write small tests, yet scales to support complex functional testing for applications and libraries.

An example of a simple test:

``` {.python}
# content of test_sample.py
def inc(x):
    return x + 1


def test_answer():
    assert inc(3) == 5
```

To execute it:

    $ pytest
    ============================= test session starts =============================
    collected 1 items

    test_sample.py F

    ================================== FAILURES ===================================
    _________________________________ test_answer _________________________________

        def test_answer():
    >       assert inc(3) == 5
    E       assert 4 == 5
    E        +  where 4 = inc(3)

    test_sample.py:5: AssertionError
    ========================== 1 failed in 0.04 seconds ===========================

Due to `pytest`\'s detailed assertion introspection, only plain `assert` statements are used. See [getting-started](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/getting-started.html#our-first-test-run) for more examples.

Features
========

-   Detailed info on failing [assert statements](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/how-to/assert.html) (no need to remember `self.assert*` names)

RELEASING.rst

---

Release Procedure
=================

Our current policy for releasing is to aim for a bug-fix release every few weeks and a minor release every 2-3 months. The idea is to get fixes and new features out instead of trying to cram a ton of features into a release and by consequence taking a lot of time to make a new one.

The git commands assume the following remotes are setup:

-   `origin`: your own fork of the repository.
-   `upstream`: the `pytest-dev/pytest` official repository.

Preparing: Automatic Method
---------------------------

We have developed an automated workflow for releases, that uses GitHub workflows and is triggered by [manually running](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/managing-workflow-runs/manually-running-a-workflow) the [prepare-release-pr workflow](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/actions/workflows/prepare-release-pr.yml) on GitHub Actions.

The automation will decide the new version number based on the following criteria:

-   If the \"major release\" input is set to \"yes\", release a new major release (e.g. 7.0.0 -\> 8.0.0)
-   If there are any `.feature.rst` or `.breaking.rst` files in the `changelog` directory, release a new minor release (e.g. 7.0.0 -\> 7.1.0)
-   Otherwise, release a bugfix release (e.g. 7.0.0 -\> 7.0.1)
-   If the \"prerelease\" input is set, append the string to the version number (e.g. 7.0.0 -\> 8.0.0rc1), if \"major\" is set, and \"prerelease\" is set to [rc1]{.title-ref})

### Bug-fix and minor releases

Bug-fix and minor releases are always done from a maintenance branch. First, consider double-checking the `changelog` directory to see if there are any breaking changes or new features.

For a new minor release, first create a new maintenance branch from `main`:

    git fetch upstream
    git branch 7.1.x upstream/main
    git push upstream 7.1.x

Then, trigger the workflow with the following inputs:

-   branch: **7.1.x**
-   major release: **no**
-   prerelease: empty

Or via the commandline using [GitHub\'s cli](https://github.com/cli/cli):

    gh workflow run prepare-release-pr.yml -f branch=7.1.x -f major=no -f prerelease=

Where `7.1.x` is the maintenance branch for the `7.1` series. The automated workflow will publish a PR for a branch `release-7.1.0`.

Similarly, for a bug-fix release, use the existing maintenance branch and trigger the workflow with e.g. `branch: 7.0.x` to get a new `release-7.0.1` PR.

### Major releases

1.  Create a new maintenance branch from `main`:

        git fetch upstream
        git branch 8.0.x upstream/main
        git push upstream 8.0.x

2.  Trigger the workflow with the following inputs:

    -   branch: **8.0.x**
    -   major release: **yes**
    -   prerelease: empty

Or via the commandline:

    gh workflow run prepare-release-pr.yml -f branch=8.0.x -f major=yes -f prerelease=

The automated workflow will publish a PR for a branch `release-8.0.0`.

At this point on, this follows the same workflow as other maintenance branches: bug-fixes are merged into `main` and ported back to the maintenance branch, even for release candidates.

### Release candidates

To release a release candidate, set the \"prerelease\" input to the version number suffix to use. To release a `8.0.0rc1`, proceed like under \"major releases\", but set:

-   branch: 8.0.x
-   major release: yes
-   prerelease: **rc1**

Or via the commandline:

    gh workflow run prepare-release-pr.yml -f branch=8.0.x -f major=yes -f prerelease=rc1

The automated workflow will publish a PR for a branch `release-8.0.0rc1`.

**A note about release candidates**

During release candidates we can merge small improvements into the maintenance branch before releasing the final major version, however we must take care to avoid introducing big changes at this stage.

Preparing: Manual Method
------------------------

**Important**: pytest releases must be prepared on **Linux** because the docs and examples expect to be executed on that platform.

To release a version `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`, follow these steps:

1.  For major and minor releases, create a new branch `MAJOR.MINOR.x` from `upstream/main` and push it to `upstream`.

2.  Create a branch `release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` from the `MAJOR.MINOR.x` branch.

    Ensure your are updated and in a clean working tree.

3.  Using `tox`, generate docs, changelog, announcements:

        $ tox -e release -- MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

    This will generate a commit with all the changes ready for pushing.

4.  Open a PR for the `release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` branch targeting `MAJOR.MINOR.x`.

Releasing
---------

Both automatic and manual processes described above follow the same steps from this point onward.

1.  After all tests pass and the PR has been approved, trigger the `deploy` job in <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/actions/workflows/deploy.yml>, using the `release-MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` branch as source.

    This job will require approval from `pytest-dev/core`, after which it will publish to PyPI and tag the repository.

2.  Merge the PR. **Make sure it\'s not squash-merged**, so that the tagged commit ends up in the main branch.

3.  Cherry-pick the CHANGELOG / announce files to the `main` branch:

        git fetch upstream
        git checkout upstream/main -b cherry-pick-release
        git cherry-pick -x -m1 upstream/MAJOR.MINOR.x

4.  Open a PR for `cherry-pick-release` and merge it once CI passes. No need to wait for approvals if there were no conflicts on the previous step.

5.  For major and minor releases (or the first prerelease of it), tag the release cherry-pick merge commit in main with a dev tag for the next feature release:

        git checkout main
        git pull
        git tag MAJOR.{MINOR+1}.0.dev0
        git push upstream MAJOR.{MINOR+1}.0.dev0

6.  Send an email announcement with the contents from:

        doc/en/announce/release-<VERSION>.rst

    To the following mailing lists:

    -   <pytest-dev@python.org> (all releases)
    -   <python-announce-list@python.org> (all releases)
    -   <testing-in-python@lists.idyll.org> (only major/minor releases)

    And announce it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/) with the `#pytest` hashtag.

TIDELIFT.rst

---

Tidelift
========

pytest is a member of [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com). This document describes how the core team manages Tidelift-related activities.

What is it
----------

Tidelift aims to make Open Source sustainable by offering subscriptions to companies which rely on Open Source packages. This subscription allows it to pay maintainers of those Open Source packages to aid sustainability of the work.

It is the perfect platform for companies that want to support Open Source packages and at the same time obtain assurances regarding maintenance, quality and security.

Funds
-----

It was decided in the [mailing list](https://mail.python.org/pipermail/pytest-dev/2019-May/004716.html) that the Tidelift contribution will be split evenly between members of the [contributors team](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/contributors) interested in receiving funding.

The current list of contributors receiving funding are:

-   [\@nicoddemus](https://github.com/nicoddemus)
-   [\@The-Compiler](https://github.com/The-Compiler)
-   [\@RonnyPfannschmidt](https://github.com/RonnyPfannschmidt)

Contributors interested in receiving a part of the funds just need to submit a PR adding their name to the list. Contributors that want to stop receiving the funds should also submit a PR in the same way.

The PR should mention [\@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/tidelift-admins/members) so appropriate changes can be made in the Tidelift platform.

After the PR has been accepted and merged, the contributor should register in the [Tidelift](https://tidelift.com) platform and follow the instructions there, including signing an [agreement](https://tidelift.com/docs/lifting/agreement).

Admins
------

A few people have admin access to the Tidelift dashboard to make changes. Those people are part of the [\@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/tidelift-admins/members) team.

[Core contributors](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/core/members) interested in helping out with Tidelift maintenance are welcome! We don\'t expect much work here other than the occasional adding/removal of a contributor from receiving funds. Just drop a line to one of the [\@pytest-dev/tidelift-admins](https://github.com/orgs/pytest-dev/teams/tidelift-admins/members) or use the mailing list.
