  - Switched docs theme to Furo.
  - Various legacy Python cleanup and CI improvements. Contributed by Christian Clauss and Hugo van Kemenade in [\#630](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/630), [\#631](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/631), [\#632](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/632) and [\#633](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/633).

  - Modernized project's pre-commit hooks to use ruff. Initial POC contributed by Christian Clauss in [\#584](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/584).

## 4.1.0 (2023-05-24)

  - Updated CI with new Pythons and dependencies.
  - Removed rsyncdir support. This makes pytest-cov compatible with xdist 3.0. Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in [\#558](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/558).
  - Optimized summary generation to not be performed if no reporting is active (for example, when `--cov-report=''` is used without `--cov-fail-under`). Contributed by Jonathan Stewmon in [\#589](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/589).

## 4.0.0 (2022-09-28)

**Note that this release drops support for multiprocessing.**

  - <span class="title-ref">--cov-fail-under</span> no longer causes <span class="title-ref">pytest --collect-only</span> to fail Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in [\#511](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/511).

  - Dropped support for multiprocessing (mostly because [issue 82408](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82408)). This feature was mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios and made the test suite very flaky and slow.
    
    There is builtin multiprocessing support in coverage and you can migrate to that. All you need is this in your `.coveragerc`:
    
        [run]
        concurrency = multiprocessing
        parallel = true
        sigterm = true

  - Fixed deprecation in `setup.py` by trying to import setuptools before distutils. Contributed by Ben Greiner in [\#545](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/545).

  - Removed undesirable new lines that were displayed while reporting was disabled. Contributed by Delgan in [\#540](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/540).

  - Documentation fixes. Contributed by Andre Brisco in [\#543](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/543) and Colin O'Dell in [\#525](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/525).

  - Added support for LCOV output format via <span class="title-ref">--cov-report=lcov</span>. Only works with coverage 6.3+. Contributed by Christian Fetzer in [\#536](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/536).

  - Modernized pytest hook implementation. Contributed by Bruno Oliveira in [\#549](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/549) and Ronny Pfannschmidt in [\#550](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/550).

## 3.0.0 (2021-10-04)

**Note that this release drops support for Python 2.7 and Python 3.5.**

  - Added support for Python 3.10 and updated various test dependencies. Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [\#500](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/500).
  - Switched from Travis CI to GitHub Actions. Contributed by Hugo van Kemenade in [\#494](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/494) and [\#495](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/495).
  - Add a `--cov-reset` CLI option. Contributed by Danilo Šegan in [\#459](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/459).
  - Improved validation of `--cov-fail-under` CLI option. Contributed by ... Ronny Pfannschmidt's desire for skark in [\#480](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/480).
  - Dropped Python 2.7 support. Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [\#488](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/488).
  - Updated trove classifiers. Contributed by Michał Bielawski in [\#481](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/481).
  - Reverted change for <span class="title-ref">toml</span> requirement. Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [\#477](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/477).

## 2.12.1 (2021-06-01)

  - Changed the <span class="title-ref">toml</span> requirement to be always be directly required (instead of being required through a coverage extra). This fixes issues with pip-compile ([pip-tools\#1300](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1300)). Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in [\#472](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/472).
  - Documented `show_contexts`. Contributed by Brian Rutledge in [\#473](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/473).

  - Improved sample projects (from the [examples](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples) directory) to support running <span class="title-ref">tox -e pyXY</span>. Now the example configures a suffixed coverage data file, and that makes the cleanup environment unnecessary. Contributed by Ganden Schaffner in [\#435](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/435).
  - Removed the empty <span class="title-ref">console\_scripts</span> entrypoint that confused some Gentoo build script. I didn't ask why it was so broken cause I didn't want to ruin my day. Contributed by Michał Górny in [\#434](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/434).
  - Fixed the missing [coverage context](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html) when using subprocesses. Contributed by Bernát Gábor in [\#443](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/443).
  - Updated the config section in the docs. Contributed by Pamela McA'Nulty in [\#429](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/429).
  - Migrated CI to travis-ci.com (from .org).

  - Support for `pytest-xdist` 2.0, which breaks compatibility with `pytest-xdist` before 1.22.3 (from 2017). Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in [\#412](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/412).
  - Fixed the `LocalPath has no attribute startswith` failure that occurred when using the `pytester` plugin in inline mode.

## 2.10.0 (2020-06-12)

  - Improved the `--no-cov` warning. Now it's only shown if `--no-cov` is present before `--cov`.
  - Removed legacy pytest support. Changed `setup.py` so that `pytest>=4.6` is required.

## 2.9.0 (2020-05-22)

  - Fixed `RemovedInPytest4Warning` when using Pytest 3.10. Contributed by Michael Manganiello in [\#354](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/354).
  - Made pytest startup faster when plugin not active by lazy-importing. Contributed by Anders Hovmöller in [\#339](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/339).

  - Changed `--cov-append` to always enable `data_suffix` (a coverage setting). Contributed by Harm Geerts in [\#387](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/387).
  - Changed `--cov-append` to handle loading previous data better (fixes various path aliasing issues).
  - Various other testing improvements, github issue templates, example updates.
  - Fixed internal failures that are caused by tests that change the current working directory by ensuring a consistent working directory when coverage is called. See [\#306](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/306) and [coveragepy\#881](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/881)

## 2.8.1 (2019-10-05)

  - Fixed [\#348](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348) -regression when only certain reports (html or xml) are used then `--cov-fail-under` always fails.

## 2.8.0 (2019-10-04)

  - Fixed `RecursionError` that can occur when using [cleanup\_on\_signal](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html#if-you-got-custom-signal-handling) or [cleanup\_on\_sigterm](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html#if-you-got-custom-signal-handling). See: [\#294](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/294). The 2.7.x releases of pytest-cov should be considered broken regarding aforementioned cleanup API.
  - Added compatibility with future xdist release that deprecates some internals (match pytest-xdist master/worker terminology). Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [\#321](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/321)
  - Fixed breakage that occurs when multiple reporting options are used. Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [\#338](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/338).

  - Various testing and CI improvements. Contributed by Daniel Hahler in [\#255](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/255), [\#266](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/266), [\#272](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/272), [\#271](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/271) and [\#269](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/269).
  - Improved `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_sigterm` to be reentrant (signal deliveries while signal handling is running won't break stuff).
  - Added `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_signal` for customized cleanup.
  - Improved cleanup code and fixed various issues with leftover data files. All contributed in [\#265](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/265) or [\#262](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/262).
  - Improved examples. Now there are two examples for the common project layouts, complete with working coverage configuration. The examples have CI testing. Contributed in [\#267](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/267).

  - Fixed bug occurred when bare `--cov` parameter was used with xdist. Contributed by Michael Elovskikh in [PR\#120](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/120).
  - Add support for `skip_covered` and added `--cov-report=term-skip-covered` command line options. Contributed by Saurabh Kumar in [PR\#115](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/115).

## 2.2.1 (2016-01-30)

  - Fixed incorrect merging of coverage data when xdist was used and coverage was `>= 4.0`.

## 2.2.0 (2015-10-04)

  - Added support for changing working directory in tests. Previously changing working directory would disable coverage measurements in suprocesses.

  - Changed `--cov-report=term` to automatically upgrade to `--cov-report=term-missing` if there's `[run] show_missing = True` in `.coveragerc`.
  - Changed `--cov` so it can be used with no path argument (in which case the source settings from `.coveragerc` will be used instead).
  - Fixed <span class="title-ref">.pth</span> installation to work in all cases (install, easy\_install, wheels, develop etc).
  - Fixed <span class="title-ref">.pth</span> uninstallation to work for wheel installs.
  - Support for coverage 4.0.
  - Data file suffixing changed to use coverage's `data_suffix=True` option (instead of the custom suffixing).
  - Avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like `coverage.control.process_startup`).
  - Fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files). It's possible that this issue is not present in <span class="title-ref">pytest-cov 1.8.X</span>.

## 1.8.2 (2014-11-06)

# Configuration

This plugin provides a clean minimal set of command line options that are added to pytest. For further control of coverage use a coverage config file.

For example if tests are contained within the directory tree being measured the tests may be excluded if desired by using a .coveragerc file with the omit option set:

    pytest --cov-config=.coveragerc
           --cov=myproj
           myproj/tests/

Where the .coveragerc file contains file globs:

    [run]
    omit = tests/*

For full details refer to the [coverage config file](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html) documentation.

Important Note

This plugin overrides the `parallel` option of coverage. Unless you also run coverage without pytest-cov it's pointless to set those options in your `.coveragerc`.

If you use the `--cov=something` option (with a value) then coverage's `source` option will also get overridden. If you have multiple sources it might be easier to set those in `.coveragerc` and always use `--cov` (without a value) instead of having a long command line with `--cov=pkg1 --cov=pkg2 --cov=pkg3 ...`.

If you use the `--cov-branch` option then coverage's `branch` option will also get overridden.

</div>

If you wish to always add pytest-cov with pytest, you can use `addopts` under the `pytest` or `tool:pytest` section of your `setup.cfg`, or the `tool.pytest.ini_options` section of your `pyproject.toml` file.

For example, in `setup.cfg`: :

    [tool:pytest]
    addopts = --cov=<project-name> --cov-report html

Or for `pyproject.toml`: :

    [tool.pytest.ini_options]
    addopts = "--cov=<project-name> --cov-report html"

## Caveats

A unfortunate consequence of coverage.py's history is that `.coveragerc` is a magic name: it's the default file but it also means "try to also lookup coverage configuration in `tox.ini` or `setup.cfg`".

In practical terms this means that if you have multiple configuration files around (`tox.ini`, `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`) you might need to use `--cov-config` to make coverage use the correct configuration file.

Also, if you change the working directory and also use subprocesses in a test you might also need to use `--cov-config` to make pytest-cov will use the expected configuration file in the subprocess.

## Reference

The complete list of command line options is:

> \--cov=PATH Measure coverage for filesystem path. (multi-allowed) --cov-report=type Type of report to generate: term, term-missing, annotate, html, xml, json, lcov (multi-allowed). term, term- missing may be followed by ":skip-covered". annotate, html, xml, json and lcov may be followed by ":DEST" where DEST specifies the output location. Use --cov-report= to not generate any output. --cov-config=path Config file for coverage. Default: .coveragerc --no-cov-on-fail Do not report coverage if test run fails. Default: False --no-cov Disable coverage report completely (useful for debuggers). Default: False --cov-reset Reset cov sources accumulated in options so far. Mostly useful for scripts and configuration files. --cov-fail-under=MIN Fail if the total coverage is less than MIN. --cov-append Do not delete coverage but append to current. Default: False --cov-branch Enable branch coverage. --cov-context Choose the method for setting the dynamic context.

# Contexts

Coverage.py 5.0 can record separate coverage data for [different contexts](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html) during one run of a test suite. Pytest-cov can use this feature to record coverage data for each test individually, with the `--cov-context=test` option.

The context name recorded in the coverage.py database is the pytest test id, and the phase of execution, one of "setup", "run", or "teardown". These two are separated with a pipe symbol. You might see contexts like:

    test_functions.py::test_addition|run
    test_fancy.py::test_parametrized[1-101]|setup
    test_oldschool.py::RegressionTests::test_error|run

Note that parameterized tests include the values of the parameters in the test id, and each set of parameter values is recorded as a separate test.

To view contexts when using `--cov-report=html`, add this to your `.coveragerc`:

    [html]
    show_contexts = True

The HTML report will include an annotation on each covered line, indicating the number of contexts that executed the line. Clicking the annotation displays a list of the contexts.

# Contributing

Contributions are welcome, and they are greatly appreciated\! Every little bit helps, and credit will always be given.

## Bug reports

When [reporting a bug](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues) please include:

>   - Your operating system name and version.
>   - Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
>   - Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

## Documentation improvements

pytest-cov could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official pytest-cov docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

## Feature requests and feedback

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

  - Explain in detail how it would work.
  - Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
  - Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that code contributions are welcome :)

## Development

To set up <span class="title-ref">pytest-cov</span> for local development:

1.  Fork [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) (look for the "Fork" button).

2.  Clone your fork locally:
    
        git clone git@github.com:YOURGITHUBNAME/pytest-cov.git

3.  Create a branch for local development:
    
        git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature
    
    Now you can make your changes locally.

4.  When you're done making changes run all the checks and docs builder with one command:
    
        tox

5.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:
    
        git add .
        git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Guidelines

If you need some code review or feedback while you're developing the code just make the pull request.

For merging, you should:

1.  Include passing tests (run `tox`).
2.  Update documentation when there's new API, functionality etc.
3.  Add a note to `CHANGELOG.rst` about the changes.
4.  Add yourself to `AUTHORS.rst`.

### Tips

To run a subset of tests:

    tox -e envname -- pytest -k test_myfeature

To run all the test environments in *parallel*:

    tox -p auto

# Debuggers and PyCharm

(or other IDEs)

When it comes to TDD one obviously would like to debug tests. Debuggers in Python use mostly the sys.settrace function to gain access to context. Coverage uses the same technique to get access to the lines executed. Coverage does not play well with other tracers simultaneously running. This manifests itself in behaviour that PyCharm might not hit a breakpoint no matter what the user does, or encountering an error like this:

    PYDEV DEBUGGER WARNING:
    sys.settrace() should not be used when the debugger is being used.
    This may cause the debugger to stop working correctly.

Since it is common practice to have coverage configuration in the pytest.ini file and pytest does not support removeopts or similar the <span class="title-ref">--no-cov</span> flag can disable coverage completely.

At the reporting part a warning message will show on screen:

    Coverage disabled via --no-cov switch!

# Markers and fixtures

There are some builtin markers and fixtures in `pytest-cov`.

## Markers

### `no_cover`

Eg:

`` `python     @pytest.mark.no_cover     def test_foobar():         # do some stuff that needs coverage disabled  .. warning:: Caveat      Note that subprocess coverage will also be disabled.  Fixtures ``\` ========

### `no_cover`

Eg:

`` `python     def test_foobar(no_cover):         # same as the marker ... ``cov`  `\` -------

For reasons that no one can remember there is a `cov` fixture that provides access to the underlying Coverage instance. Some say this is a disguised foot-gun and should be removed, and some think mysteries make life more interesting and it should be left alone.

# Plugin coverage

Getting coverage on pytest plugins is a very particular situation. Because of how pytest implements plugins (using setuptools entrypoints) it doesn't allow controlling the order in which the plugins load. See [pytest/issues/935](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest/issues/935#issuecomment-245107960) for technical details.

The current way of dealing with this problem is using the append feature and manually starting `pytest-cov`'s engine, eg:

    COV_CORE_SOURCE=src COV_CORE_CONFIG=.coveragerc COV_CORE_DATAFILE=.coverage.eager pytest --cov=src --cov-append

Alternatively you can have this in `tox.ini` (if you're using [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) of course):

    [testenv]
    setenv =
        COV_CORE_SOURCE=
        COV_CORE_CONFIG={toxinidir}/.coveragerc
        COV_CORE_DATAFILE={toxinidir}/.coverage

And in `pytest.ini` / `tox.ini` / `setup.cfg`:

    [tool:pytest]
    addopts = --cov --cov-append

This plugin produces coverage reports. Compared to just using `coverage run` this plugin does some extras:

  - Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.
  - Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist's features and still get coverage.
  - Consistent pytest behavior. If you run `coverage run -m pytest` you will have slightly different `sys.path` (CWD will be in it, unlike when running `pytest`).

All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov's command line options or through coverage's config file.

  - Free software: MIT license

## Installation

Install with pip:

    pip install pytest-cov

For distributed testing support install pytest-xdist:

    pip install pytest-xdist

### Upgrading from ancient pytest-cov

<span class="title-ref">pytest-cov 2.0</span> is using a new `.pth` file (`pytest-cov.pth`). You may want to manually remove the older `init_cov_core.pth` from site-packages as it's not automatically removed.

### Uninstalling

Uninstall with pip:

    pip uninstall pytest-cov

Under certain scenarios a stray `.pth` file may be left around in site-packages.

  - <span class="title-ref">pytest-cov 2.0</span> may leave a `pytest-cov.pth` if you installed without wheels (`easy_install`, `setup.py install` etc).
  - <span class="title-ref">pytest-cov 1.8 or older</span> will leave a `init_cov_core.pth`.

## Usage

    pytest --cov=myproj tests/

Would produce a report like:

    -------------------- coverage: ... ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

## Documentation

> <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

## Coverage Data File

The data file is erased at the beginning of testing to ensure clean data for each test run. If you need to combine the coverage of several test runs you can use the `--cov-append` option to append this coverage data to coverage data from previous test runs.

The data file is left at the end of testing so that it is possible to use normal coverage tools to examine it.

## Limitations

For distributed testing the workers must have the pytest-cov package installed. This is needed since the plugin must be registered through setuptools for pytest to start the plugin on the worker.

For subprocess measurement environment variables must make it from the main process to the subprocess. The python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed. The subprocess must do normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coverage started. See the [subprocess support docs](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html) for more details of how this works.

## Security

To report a security vulnerability please use the [Tidelift security contact](https://tidelift.com/security). Tidelift will coordinate the fix and disclosure.

## Acknowledgements

Whilst this plugin has been built fresh from the ground up it has been influenced by the work done on pytest-coverage (Ross Lawley, James Mills, Holger Krekel) and nose-cover (Jason Pellerin) which are other coverage plugins.

# Releasing

The process for releasing should follow these steps:

1.  Test that docs build and render properly by running `tox -e docs`.
    
    If there are bogus spelling issues add the words in `spelling_wordlist.txt`.

2.  Update `CHANGELOG.rst` and `AUTHORS.rst` to be up to date.

3.  Bump the version by running `bumpversion [ major | minor | patch ]`. This will automatically add a tag.

4.  Push changes and tags with:
    
        git push
        git push --tags

5.  Wait [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/actions) to give the green builds.

6.  Check that the docs on [ReadTheDocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pytest-cov) are built.

7.  Make sure you have a clean checkout, run `git status` to verify.

8.  Manually clean temporary files (that are ignored and won't show up in `git status`):
    
        rm -rf dist build src/*.egg-info
    
    These files need to be removed to force distutils/setuptools to rebuild everything and recreate the egg-info metadata.

9.  Build the dists:
    
        python3 setup.py clean --all sdist bdist_wheel

10. Verify that the resulting archives (found in `dist/`) are good.

11. Upload the sdist and wheel with twine:
    
        twine upload dist/*

# Reporting

It is possible to generate any combination of the reports for a single test run.

The available reports are terminal (with or without missing line numbers shown), HTML, XML, JSON, LCOV and annotated source code.

The terminal report without line numbers (default):

    pytest --cov-report term --cov=myproj tests/
    
    -------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

The terminal report with line numbers:

    pytest --cov-report term-missing --cov=myproj tests/
    
    -------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover   Missing
    --------------------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%   24-26, 99, 149, 233-236, 297-298, 369-370
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%   183-188, 197
    --------------------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

The terminal report with skip covered:

    pytest --cov-report term:skip-covered --cov=myproj tests/
    
    -------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%
    
    1 files skipped due to complete coverage.

You can use `skip-covered` with `term-missing` as well. e.g. `--cov-report term-missing:skip-covered`

These four report options output to files without showing anything on the terminal:

    pytest --cov-report html
            --cov-report xml
            --cov-report json
            --cov-report lcov
            --cov-report annotate
            --cov=myproj tests/

The output location for each of these reports can be specified. The output location for the XML, JSON and LCOV report is a file. Where as the output location for the HTML and annotated source code reports are directories:

    pytest --cov-report html:cov_html
            --cov-report xml:cov.xml
            --cov-report json:cov.json
            --cov-report lcov:cov.info
            --cov-report annotate:cov_annotate
            --cov=myproj tests/

The final report option can also suppress printing to the terminal:

    pytest --cov-report= --cov=myproj tests/

This mode can be especially useful on continuous integration servers, where a coverage file is needed for subsequent processing, but no local report needs to be viewed. For example, tests run on GitHub Actions could produce a .coverage file for use with Coveralls.

subprocess-support.md

# Subprocess support

Normally coverage writes the data via a pretty standard atexit handler. However, if the subprocess doesn't exit on its own then the atexit handler might not run. Why that happens is best left to the adventurous to discover by waddling through the Python bug tracker.

pytest-cov supports subprocesses, and works around these atexit limitations. However, there are a few pitfalls that need to be explained.

But first, how does pytest-cov's subprocess support works?

pytest-cov packaging injects a pytest-cov.pth into the installation. This file effectively runs this at *every* python startup:

`` `python     if 'COV_CORE_SOURCE' in os.environ:         try:             from pytest_cov.embed import init             init()         except Exception as exc:             sys.stderr.write(                 "pytest-cov: Failed to setup subprocess coverage. "                 "Environ: {0!r} "                 "Exception: {1!r}\n".format(                     dict((k, v) for k, v in os.environ.items() if k.startswith('COV_CORE')),                     exc                 )             )  The pytest plugin will set this ``COV\_CORE\_SOURCE`environment variable thus any subprocess that inherits the environment variables`<span class="title-ref"> (the default behavior) will run </span><span class="title-ref">pytest\_cov.embed.init</span>\` which in turn sets up coverage according to these variables:

  - `COV_CORE_SOURCE`
  - `COV_CORE_CONFIG`
  - `COV_CORE_DATAFILE`
  - `COV_CORE_BRANCH`
  - `COV_CORE_CONTEXT`

Why does it have the `COV_CORE` you wonder? Well, it's mostly historical reasons: long time ago pytest-cov depended on a cov-core package that implemented common functionality for pytest-cov, nose-cov and nose2-cov. The dependency is gone but the convention is kept. It could be changed but it would break all projects that manually set these intended-to-be-internal-but-sadly-not-in-reality environment variables.

## Coverage's subprocess support

Now that you understand how pytest-cov works you can easily figure out that using [coverage's recommended](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess.html) way of dealing with subprocesses, by either having this in a `.pth` file or `sitecustomize.py` will break everything:

    import coverage; coverage.process_startup()  # this will break pytest-cov

Do not do that as that will restart coverage with the wrong options.

## If you use `multiprocessing`

Builtin support for multiprocessing was dropped in pytest-cov 4.0. This support was mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios (see [issue 82408](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82408)) and made the test suite very flaky and slow.

However, there is [builtin multiprocessing support in coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html#run-concurrency) and you can migrate to that. All you need is this in your preferred configuration file (example: `.coveragerc`):

`` `ini     [run]     concurrency = multiprocessing     parallel = true     sigterm = true  Now as a side-note, it's a good idea in general to properly close your Pool by using ``Pool.join()`:  .. code-block:: python      from multiprocessing import Pool      def f(x):         return x*x      if __name__ == '__main__':         p = Pool(5)         try:             print(p.map(f, [1, 2, 3]))         finally:             p.close()  # Marks the pool as closed.             p.join()   # Waits for workers to exit.   .. _cleanup_on_sigterm:  Signal handlers`\` ===============

pytest-cov provides a signal handling routines, mostly for special situations where you'd have custom signal handling that doesn't allow atexit to properly run and the now-gone multiprocessing support:

  - `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_sigterm()`
  - `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_signal(signum)` (e.g.: `cleanup_on_signal(signal.SIGHUP)`)

### If you use multiprocessing

It is not recommanded to use these signal handlers with multiprocessing as registering signal handlers will cause deadlocks in the pool, see: <https://bugs.python.org/issue38227>).

### If you got custom signal handling

**pytest-cov 2.6** has a rudimentary `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_sigterm` you can use to register a SIGTERM handler that flushes the coverage data.

**pytest-cov 2.7** adds a `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_signal` function and changes the implementation to be more robust: the handler will call the previous handler (if you had previously registered any), and is re-entrant (will defer extra signals if delivered while the handler runs).

For example, if you reload on SIGHUP you should have something like this:

`` `python     import os     import signal      def restart_service(frame, signum):         os.exec( ... )  # or whatever your custom signal would do     signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, restart_service)      try:         from pytest_cov.embed import cleanup_on_signal     except ImportError:         pass     else:         cleanup_on_signal(signal.SIGHUP)  Note that both ``cleanup\_on\_signal`and`cleanup\_on\_sigterm`will run the previous signal handler.  Alternatively you can do this:  .. code-block:: python      import os     import signal      try:         from pytest_cov.embed import cleanup     except ImportError:         cleanup = None      def restart_service(frame, signum):         if cleanup is not None:             cleanup()          os.exec( ... )  # or whatever your custom signal would do     signal.signal(signal.SIGHUP, restart_service)  If you use Windows`\` ------------------

On Windows you can register a handler for SIGTERM but it doesn't actually work. It will work if you <span class="title-ref">os.kill(os.getpid(), signal.SIGTERM)</span> (send SIGTERM to the current process) but for most intents and purposes that's completely useless.

Consequently this means that if you use multiprocessing you got no choice but to use the close/join pattern as described above. Using the context manager API or <span class="title-ref">terminate</span> won't work as it relies on SIGTERM.

However you can have a working handler for SIGBREAK (with some caveats):

`` `python     import os     import signal      def shutdown(frame, signum):         # your app's shutdown or whatever     signal.signal(signal.SIGBREAK, shutdown)      try:         from pytest_cov.embed import cleanup_on_signal     except ImportError:         pass     else:         cleanup_on_signal(signal.SIGBREAK)  The `caveats <https://stefan.sofa-rockers.org/2013/08/15/handling-sub-process-hierarchies-python-linux-os-x/>`_ being ``\` roughly:

  - you need to deliver `signal.CTRL_BREAK_EVENT`
  - it gets delivered to the whole process group, and that can have unforeseen consequences

# Tox

When using [tox](https://tox.wiki/en/stable/) you can have ultra-compact configuration - you can have all of it in `tox.ini`:

    [tox]
    envlist = ...
    
    [tool:pytest]
    ...
    
    [coverage:paths]
    ...
    
    [coverage:run]
    ...
    
    [coverage:report]
    ..
    
    [testenv]
    commands = ...

An usual problem users have is that pytest-cov will erase the previous coverage data by default, thus if you run tox with multiple environments you'll get incomplete coverage at the end.

To prevent this problem you need to use `--cov-append`. It's still recommended to clean the previous coverage data to have consistent output. A `tox.ini` like this should be enough for sequential runs:

    [tox]
    envlist = clean,py27,py36,...
    
    [testenv]
    commands = pytest --cov --cov-append --cov-report=term-missing ...
    deps =
        pytest
        pytest-cov
    
    [testenv:clean]
    deps = coverage
    skip_install = true
    commands = coverage erase

For parallel runs we need to set some dependencies and have an extra report env like so:

    [tox]
    envlist = clean,py27,py36,report
    
    [testenv]
    commands = pytest --cov --cov-append --cov-report=term-missing
    deps =
        pytest
        pytest-cov
    depends =
        {py27,py36}: clean
        report: py27,py36
    
    [testenv:report]
    deps = coverage
    skip_install = true
    commands =
        coverage report
        coverage html
    
    [testenv:clean]
    deps = coverage
    skip_install = true
    commands = coverage erase

Depending on your project layout you might need extra configuration, see the working examples at <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples> for two common layouts.

# Distributed testing (xdist)

## "load" mode

Distributed testing with dist mode set to "load" will report on the combined coverage of all workers. The workers may be spread out over any number of hosts and each worker may be located anywhere on the file system. Each worker will have its subprocesses measured.

Running distributed testing with dist mode set to load:

    pytest --cov=myproj -n 2 tests/

Shows a terminal report:

    -------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

Again but spread over different hosts and different directories:

    pytest --cov=myproj --dist load
            --tx ssh=memedough@host1//chdir=testenv1
            --tx ssh=memedough@host2//chdir=/tmp/testenv2//python=/tmp/env1/bin/python
            --rsyncdir myproj --rsyncdir tests --rsync examples
            tests/

Shows a terminal report:

    -------------------- coverage: platform linux2, python 2.6.4-final-0 ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

## "each" mode

Distributed testing with dist mode set to each will report on the combined coverage of all workers. Since each worker is running all tests this allows generating a combined coverage report for multiple environments.

Running distributed testing with dist mode set to each:

    pytest --cov=myproj --dist each
            --tx popen//chdir=/tmp/testenv3//python=/usr/local/python27/bin/python
            --tx ssh=memedough@host2//chdir=/tmp/testenv4//python=/tmp/env2/bin/python
            --rsyncdir myproj --rsyncdir tests --rsync examples
            tests/

Shows a terminal report:

    ---------------------------------------- coverage ----------------------------------------
                              platform linux2, python 2.6.5-final-0
                              platform linux2, python 2.7.0-final-0
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

-   Switched docs theme to Furo.
-   Various legacy Python cleanup and CI improvements. Contributed by Christian Clauss and Hugo van Kemenade in [\#630](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/630), [\#631](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/631), [\#632](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/632) and [\#633](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/633).
-   Added a `pyproject.toml` example in the docs. Contributed by Dawn James in [\#626](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/626).
-   Modernized project\'s pre-commit hooks to use ruff. Initial POC contributed by Christian Clauss in [\#584](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/584).

4.1.0 (2023-05-24)
------------------

-   Updated CI with new Pythons and dependencies.
-   Removed rsyncdir support. This makes pytest-cov compatible with xdist 3.0. Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in [\#558](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/558).
-   Optimized summary generation to not be performed if no reporting is active (for example, when `--cov-report=''` is used without `--cov-fail-under`). Contributed by Jonathan Stewmon in [\#589](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/589).
-   Added support for JSON reporting. Contributed by Matthew Gamble in [\#582](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/582).
-   Refactored code to use f-strings. Contributed by Mark Mayo in [\#572](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/572).

4.0.0 (2022-09-28)
------------------

**Note that this release drops support for multiprocessing.**

-   [\--cov-fail-under]{.title-ref} no longer causes [pytest \--collect-only]{.title-ref} to fail Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in [\#511](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/511).

-   Dropped support for multiprocessing (mostly because [issue 82408](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/82408)). This feature was mostly working but very broken in certain scenarios and made the test suite very flaky and slow.

    There is builtin multiprocessing support in coverage and you can migrate to that. All you need is this in your `.coveragerc`:

        [run]
        concurrency = multiprocessing
        parallel = true
        sigterm = true

-   Fixed deprecation in `setup.py` by trying to import setuptools before distutils. Contributed by Ben Greiner in [\#545](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/545).

-   Updated trove classifiers. Contributed by Michał Bielawski in [\#481](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/481).
-   Reverted change for [toml]{.title-ref} requirement. Contributed by Thomas Grainger in [\#477](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/477).

2.12.1 (2021-06-01)
-------------------

-   Changed the [toml]{.title-ref} requirement to be always be directly required (instead of being required through a coverage extra). This fixes issues with pip-compile ([pip-tools\#1300](https://github.com/jazzband/pip-tools/issues/1300)). Contributed by Sorin Sbarnea in [\#472](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/472).
-   Documented `show_contexts`. Contributed by Brian Rutledge in [\#473](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/473).

2.12.0 (2021-05-14)
-------------------

-   Added coverage\'s [toml]{.title-ref} extra to install requirements in setup.py. Contributed by Christian Riedel in [\#410](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/410).
-   Fixed `pytest_cov.__version__` to have the right value (string with version instead of a string including `__version__ =`).
-   Fixed license classifier in `setup.py`. Contributed by Chris Sreesangkom in [\#467](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/467).
-   Fixed *commits since* badge. Contributed by Terence Honles in [\#470](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/470).

2.11.1 (2021-01-20)
-------------------

-   Fixed support for newer setuptools (v42+). Contributed by Michał Górny in [\#451](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/451).

2.11.0 (2021-01-18)
-------------------

-   Bumped minimum coverage requirement to 5.2.1. This prevents reporting issues. Contributed by Mateus Berardo de Souza Terra in [\#433](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/433).
-   Improved sample projects (from the [examples](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/tree/master/examples) directory) to support running [tox -e pyXY]{.title-ref}. Now the example configures a suffixed coverage data file, and that makes the cleanup environment unnecessary. Contributed by Ganden Schaffner in [\#435](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/435).
-   Removed the empty [console\_scripts]{.title-ref} entrypoint that confused some Gentoo build script. I didn\'t ask why it was so broken cause I didn\'t want to ruin my day. Contributed by Michał Górny in [\#434](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/434).
-   Fixed the missing [coverage context](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contexts.html) when using subprocesses. Contributed by Bernát Gábor in [\#443](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/443).
-   Updated the config section in the docs. Contributed by Pamela McA\'Nulty in [\#429](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/429).
-   Migrated CI to travis-ci.com (from .org).

2.10.1 (2020-08-14)
-------------------

-   Support for `pytest-xdist` 2.0, which breaks compatibility with `pytest-xdist` before 1.22.3 (from 2017). Contributed by Zac Hatfield-Dodds in [\#412](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/412).
-   Fixed the `LocalPath has no attribute startswith` failure that occurred when using the `pytester` plugin in inline mode.

2.10.0 (2020-06-12)
-------------------

-   Improved the `--no-cov` warning. Now it\'s only shown if `--no-cov` is present before `--cov`.
-   Removed legacy pytest support. Changed `setup.py` so that `pytest>=4.6` is required.

2.9.0 (2020-05-22)
------------------

-   Fixed `RemovedInPytest4Warning` when using Pytest 3.10. Contributed by Michael Manganiello in [\#354](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/354).
-   Made pytest startup faster when plugin not active by lazy-importing. Contributed by Anders Hovmöller in [\#339](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/339).
-   Various CI improvements. Contributed by Daniel Hahler in [\#363](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/363) and [\#364](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/364).

-   Changed `--cov-append` to handle loading previous data better (fixes various path aliasing issues).
-   Various other testing improvements, github issue templates, example updates.
-   Fixed internal failures that are caused by tests that change the current working directory by ensuring a consistent working directory when coverage is called. See [\#306](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/306) and [coveragepy\#881](https://github.com/nedbat/coveragepy/issues/881)

2.8.1 (2019-10-05)
------------------

-   Fixed [\#348](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/348) -regression when only certain reports (html or xml) are used then `--cov-fail-under` always fails.

-   Improved `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_sigterm` to be reentrant (signal deliveries while signal handling is running won\'t break stuff).
-   Added `pytest_cov.embed.cleanup_on_signal` for customized cleanup.
-   Improved cleanup code and fixed various issues with leftover data files. All contributed in [\#265](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/265) or [\#262](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/262).

-   Fixed broken exception handling on `.pth` file. See [\#136](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/136).

2.3.1 (2016-08-07)
------------------

-   Fixed regression causing spurious errors when xdist was used. See [\#124](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues/124).

-   Fixed bug occurred when bare `--cov` parameter was used with xdist. Contributed by Michael Elovskikh in [PR\#120](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/120).
-   Add support for `skip_covered` and added `--cov-report=term-skip-covered` command line options. Contributed by Saurabh Kumar in [PR\#115](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/pull/115).

2.2.1 (2016-01-30)
------------------

-   Fixed incorrect merging of coverage data when xdist was used and coverage was `>= 4.0`.

2.2.0 (2015-10-04)
------------------

-   Added support for changing working directory in tests. Previously changing working directory would disable coverage measurements in suprocesses.

2.0.0 (2015-07-28)
------------------

-   Added `--cov-fail-under`, akin to the new `fail_under` option in [coverage-4.0]{.title-ref} (automatically activated if there\'s a `[report] fail_under = ...` in `.coveragerc`).
-   Changed `--cov-report=term` to automatically upgrade to `--cov-report=term-missing` if there\'s `[run] show_missing = True` in `.coveragerc`.
-   Changed `--cov` so it can be used with no path argument (in which case the source settings from `.coveragerc` will be used instead).
-   Fixed [.pth]{.title-ref} installation to work in all cases (install, easy\_install, wheels, develop etc).
-   Fixed [.pth]{.title-ref} uninstallation to work for wheel installs.
-   Support for coverage 4.0.
-   Data file suffixing changed to use coverage\'s `data_suffix=True` option (instead of the custom suffixing).
-   Avoid warning about missing coverage data (just like `coverage.control.process_startup`).
-   Fixed a race condition when running with xdist (all the workers tried to combine the files). It\'s possible that this issue is not present in [pytest-cov 1.8.X]{.title-ref}.

1.8.2 (2014-11-06)

> -   Your operating system name and version.
> -   Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
> -   Detailed steps to reproduce the bug.

Documentation improvements
--------------------------

pytest-cov could always use more documentation, whether as part of the official pytest-cov docs, in docstrings, or even on the web in blog posts, articles, and such.

Feature requests and feedback
-----------------------------

The best way to send feedback is to file an issue at <https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov/issues>.

If you are proposing a feature:

-   Explain in detail how it would work.
-   Keep the scope as narrow as possible, to make it easier to implement.
-   Remember that this is a volunteer-driven project, and that code contributions are welcome :)

Development
-----------

To set up [pytest-cov]{.title-ref} for local development:

1.  Fork [pytest-cov](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov) (look for the \"Fork\" button).

2.  Clone your fork locally:

        git clone git@github.com:YOURGITHUBNAME/pytest-cov.git

3.  Create a branch for local development:

        git checkout -b name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

    Now you can make your changes locally.

4.  When you\'re done making changes run all the checks and docs builder with one command:

        tox

5.  Commit your changes and push your branch to GitHub:

        git add .
        git commit -m "Your detailed description of your changes."
        git push origin name-of-your-bugfix-or-feature

6.  Submit a pull request through the GitHub website.

### Pull Request Guidelines

If you need some code review or feedback while you\'re developing the code just make the pull request.

For merging, you should:

1.  Include passing tests (run `tox`).
2.  Update documentation when there\'s new API, functionality etc.
3.  Add a note to `CHANGELOG.rst` about the changes.
4.  Add yourself to `AUTHORS.rst`.

### Tips

To run a subset of tests:

    tox -e envname -- pytest -k test_myfeature

To run all the test environments in *parallel*:

    tox -p auto

This plugin produces coverage reports. Compared to just using `coverage run` this plugin does some extras:

-   Subprocess support: you can fork or run stuff in a subprocess and will get covered without any fuss.
-   Xdist support: you can use all of pytest-xdist\'s features and still get coverage.
-   Consistent pytest behavior. If you run `coverage run -m pytest` you will have slightly different `sys.path` (CWD will be in it, unlike when running `pytest`).

All features offered by the coverage package should work, either through pytest-cov\'s command line options or through coverage\'s config file.

-   Free software: MIT license

Installation
------------

Install with pip:

    pip install pytest-cov

For distributed testing support install pytest-xdist:

    pip install pytest-xdist

### Upgrading from ancient pytest-cov

[pytest-cov 2.0]{.title-ref} is using a new `.pth` file (`pytest-cov.pth`). You may want to manually remove the older `init_cov_core.pth` from site-packages as it\'s not automatically removed.

### Uninstalling

Uninstall with pip:

    pip uninstall pytest-cov

Under certain scenarios a stray `.pth` file may be left around in site-packages.

-   [pytest-cov 2.0]{.title-ref} may leave a `pytest-cov.pth` if you installed without wheels (`easy_install`, `setup.py install` etc).
-   [pytest-cov 1.8 or older]{.title-ref} will leave a `init_cov_core.pth`.

Usage
-----

    pytest --cov=myproj tests/

Would produce a report like:

    -------------------- coverage: ... ---------------------
    Name                 Stmts   Miss  Cover
    ----------------------------------------
    myproj/__init__          2      0   100%
    myproj/myproj          257     13    94%
    myproj/feature4286      94      7    92%
    ----------------------------------------
    TOTAL                  353     20    94%

Documentation
-------------

> <https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>

Coverage Data File
------------------

The data file is erased at the beginning of testing to ensure clean data for each test run. If you need to combine the coverage of several test runs you can use the `--cov-append` option to append this coverage data to coverage data from previous test runs.

The data file is left at the end of testing so that it is possible to use normal coverage tools to examine it.

Limitations
-----------

For distributed testing the workers must have the pytest-cov package installed. This is needed since the plugin must be registered through setuptools for pytest to start the plugin on the worker.

For subprocess measurement environment variables must make it from the main process to the subprocess. The python used by the subprocess must have pytest-cov installed. The subprocess must do normal site initialisation so that the environment variables can be detected and coverage started. See the [subprocess support docs](https://pytest-cov.readthedocs.io/en/latest/subprocess-support.html) for more details of how this works.

Security
