# Usage

`pyreverse` is run from the command line using the following syntax:

    pyreverse [options] <packages>

where `<packages>` is one or more Python packages or modules to analyze.

The available options are organized into the following categories:

  - \[filtering-and-scope\](\#filtering-and-scope) - Control which classes and relationships appear in your diagrams
  - \[display-options\](\#display-options) - Customize the visual appearance including colors and labels
  - \[output-control\](\#output-control) - Select output formats and set the destination directory
  - \[project-configuration\](\#project-configuration) - Define project settings like source roots and ignored files

## Filtering and Scope

### \--all-ancestors

*Show all ancestors of all classes in \<projects\>.*

**Default:** `None`

### \--all-associated

*Show all classes associated with the target classes, including indirect associations.*

**Default:** `None`

### \--class

*Create a class diagram with all classes related to \<class\>; this uses by default the options -ASmy*

**Default:** `None`

### \--filter-mode

*Filter attributes and functions according to \<mode\>. Correct modes are: 'PUB\_ONLY' filter all non public attributes \[DEFAULT\], equivalent to PRIVATE+SPECIAL 'ALL' no filter 'SPECIAL' filter Python special functions except constructor 'OTHER' filter protected and private attributes*

**Default:** `PUB_ONLY`

### \--show-ancestors

*Show \<ancestor\> generations of ancestor classes not in \<projects\>.*

**Default:** `None`

### \--show-associated

*Show \<association\_level\> levels of associated classes not in \<projects\>.*

**Default:** `None`

### \--show-builtin

*Include builtin objects in representation of classes.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--show-stdlib

*Include standard library objects in representation of classes.*

**Default:** `False`

## Display Options

### \--color-palette

*Comma separated list of colors to use for the package depth coloring.*

**Default:** `('#77AADD', '#99DDFF', '#44BB99', '#BBCC33', '#AAAA00', '#EEDD88', '#EE8866', '#FFAABB', '#DDDDDD')`

### \--colorized

*Use colored output. Classes/modules of the same package get the same color.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--max-color-depth

*Use separate colors up to package depth of \<depth\>. Higher depths will reuse colors.*

**Default:** `2`

### \--module-names

*Include module name in the representation of classes.*

**Default:** `None`

### \--no-standalone

*Only show nodes with connections.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--only-classnames

*Don't show attributes and methods in the class boxes; this disables -f values.*

**Default:** `False`

## Output Control

### \--output

*Create a*.\<format\> output file if format is available. Available formats are: .dot, .puml, .plantuml, .mmd, .html. Any other format will be tried to be created by using the 'dot' command line tool, which requires a graphviz installation. In this case, these additional formats are available (see [Graphviz output formats](https://graphviz.org/docs/outputs/)).\*

**Default:** `dot`

### \--output-directory

*Set the output directory path.*

**Default:** `""`

## Project Configuration

### \--ignore

*Files or directories to be skipped. They should be base names, not paths.*

**Default:** `('CVS',)`

### \--project

*Set the project name. This will later be appended to the output file names.*

**Default:** `""`

### \--source-roots

*Add paths to the list of the source roots. Supports globbing patterns. The source root is an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory used to determine a package namespace for modules located under the source root.*

**Default:** `()`

### \--verbose

*Makes pyreverse more verbose/talkative. Mostly useful for debugging.*

**Default:** `False`

# Pyreverse

`pyreverse` is a powerful tool that creates UML diagrams from your Python code. It helps you visualize:

  - Package dependencies and structure
  - Class hierarchies and relationships
  - Method and attribute organization

## Output Formats

`pyreverse` supports multiple output formats:

  -   - Native formats:
        
          - `.dot`/`.gv` (Graphviz)
          - `.puml`/`.plantuml` (PlantUML)
          - `.mmd`/`.html` (MermaidJS)

  -   - Additional formats (requires Graphviz installation):
        
          - All [Graphviz output formats](https://graphviz.org/docs/outputs/) (PNG, SVG, PDF, etc.)
          - `pyreverse` first generates a temporary `.gv` file, which is then fed to Graphviz to generate the final image

## Getting Started

Check out the \[configuration\](configuration.md) guide to learn about available options, or see \[output\_examples\](output\_examples.md) for sample diagrams and common use cases.

# Example Output

Example diagrams generated with the `.puml` output format are shown below.

### Creating Class Diagrams for Specific Classes

In many cases creating a single diagram depicting all classes in the project yields a rather unwieldy, giant diagram. While limiting the input path to a single package or module can already help greatly to narrow down the scope, the `-c` option provides another way to create a class diagram focusing on a single class and its collaborators. For example, running:

    pyreverse -ASmy -c pylint.checkers.classes.ClassChecker pylint

will generate the full class and package diagrams for `pylint`, but will additionally generate a file `pylint.checkers.classes.ClassChecker.dot`:

# Symilar

The console script `symilar` finds copy pasted block of text in a set of files. It provides a command line interface to check only the `duplicate-code` message.

It can be invoked with:

    symilar [-d|--duplicates min_duplicated_lines] [-i|--ignore-comments] [--ignore-docstrings] [--ignore-imports] [--ignore-signatures] file1...

All files that shall be checked have to be passed in explicitly, e.g.:

    symilar foo.py, bar.py, subpackage/spam.py, subpackage/eggs.py

`symilar` produces output like the following:

    17 similar lines in 2 files
    ==tests/data/clientmodule_test.py:3
    ==tests/data/suppliermodule_test.py:12
      class Ancestor:

              self.attr = 'this method shouldn\'t have a docstring'
              self.__value = value
    
          def get_value(self):

`\z` is same as `\\z` because there's no escape sequence for `z`. But it is not clear for the reader of the code.

The only reason this is demonstrated to raise `syntax-error` is because pylint's CI now runs on Python 3.12, where this truly raises a `SyntaxError`. We hope to address this discrepancy in the documentation in the future.

A common misconception is that `str.strip('Hello')` removes the *substring* `'Hello'` from the beginning and end of the string. This is **not** the case. From the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=strip#str.strip):

\> The chars argument is not a prefix or suffix; rather, all combinations of its values are stripped

Duplicated characters in the `str.strip` call, besides not having any effect on the actual result, may indicate this misunderstanding.

In Python 2.7, `super()` has to be called with its own class and `self` as arguments (`super(Cat, self)`), which can lead to a mix up of parent and child class in the code.

In Python 3 the recommended way is to call `super()` without arguments (see also `super-with-arguments`).

One exception is calling `super()` on a non-direct parent class. This can be used to get a method other than the default method returned by the `mro()`.

A good rule of thumb is to limit use of bare ‘except’ clauses to two cases: - If the exception handler will be printing out or logging the traceback; at least the user will be aware that an error has occurred. - If the code needs to do some cleanup work, but then lets the exception propagate upwards with raise. `try...finally` can be a better way to handle this case.

Using the shorthand syntax for union types is recommended over the `typing` module\_\_. This is consistent with the broader recommendation to prefer built-in types over imports (for example, using `list` instead of the now-deprecated `typing.List`).

`typing.Optional` can also cause confusion in annotated function arguments, since an argument annotated as `Optional` is still a *required* argument when a default value is not set. Explicitly annotating such arguments with `type | None` makes the intention clear.

Removing `[]` inside calls that can use containers or generators should be considered for performance reasons since a generator will have an upfront cost to pay. The performance will be better if you are working with long lists or sets.

Calling `write()` without using the `with` keyword or calling `close()` might result in the arguments of `write()` not being completely written to the disk, even if the program exits successfully.

This message applies to callables of Python's stdlib which can be replaced by a `with` statement. It is suppressed in the following cases:

  - the call is located inside a context manager
  - the call result is returned from the enclosing function

Instantiating and using a contextmanager inside a generator function can result in unexpected behavior if there is an expectation that the context is only available for the generator function. In the case that the generator is not closed or destroyed then the context manager is held suspended as is.

This message warns on the generator function instead of the contextmanager function because the ways to use a contextmanager are many. A contextmanager can be used as a decorator (which immediately has `__enter__`/`__exit__` applied) and the use of `as ...` or discard of the return value also implies whether the context needs cleanup or not. So for this message, warning the invoker of the contextmanager is important.

The check can create false positives if `yield` is used inside an `if-else` block without custom cleanup. Use `pylint: disable` for these.

`` `python from contextlib import contextmanager  @contextmanager def good_cm_no_cleanup():     contextvar = "acquired context"     print("cm enter")     if some_condition:         yield contextvar     else:         yield contextvar   def good_cm_no_cleanup_genfunc():     # pylint: disable-next=contextmanager-generator-missing-cleanup     with good_cm_no_cleanup() as context:         yield context * 2 ``\`

If you need to make a change to the logic or functionality of the duplicated code, you will need to identify all the places that need to be changed, which can be time-consuming and error-prone. If there are multiple copies of the same code, then you will also need to test each copy to ensure that the functionality is correct. Duplicate code can be confusing for someone who is trying to understand the logic and flow of the code if they come across multiple identical or nearly identical blocks of code. The reader can then skim and think something is identical when it actually isn't. This is particularly true during review.

This message exists because one of our checkers is very generic, but it's never going to raise during normal use as it's a `syntax-error` that would prevent the python ast (and thus pylint) from constructing a code representation of the file.

You could encounter it by feeding a properly constructed node directly to the checker.

Pylint recognizes a number of different name types internally. With a few exceptions, the type of the name is governed by the location the assignment to a name is found in, and not the type of object assigned.

| Name Type         | Description                                                                                       |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `module`          | Module and package names, same as the file names.                                                 |
| `const`           | Module-level constants, any variable defined at module level that is not bound to a class object. |
| `class`           | Names in `class` statements, as well as names bound to class objects at module level.             |
| `function`        | Functions, toplevel or nested in functions or methods.                                            |
| `method`          | Methods, functions defined in class bodies. Includes static and class methods.                    |
| `attr`            | Attributes created on class instances inside methods.                                             |
| `argument`        | Arguments to any function type, including lambdas.                                                |
| `variable`        | Local variables in function scopes.                                                               |
| `class-attribute` | Attributes defined in class bodies.                                                               |

# Default behavior

By default, Pylint will enforce [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008)-suggested names.

# Predefined Naming Styles

Pylint provides set of predefined naming styles. Those predefined naming styles may be used to adjust Pylint configuration to coding style used in linted project.

Following predefined naming styles are available:

  - `snake_case`
  - `camelCase`
  - `PascalCase`
  - `UPPER_CASE`
  - `any` - fake style which does not enforce any limitations

Following options are exposed:

<div class="option">

\--module-naming-style=\<style\>

</div>

# Predefined Naming Patterns

Pylint provides predefined naming patterns for some names. These patterns are often based on a Naming Style but there is no option to choose one of the styles mentioned above. The pattern can be overwritten with the options discussed below.

The following types of names are checked with a predefined pattern:

<table>
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 15%" />
<col style="width: 40%" />
<col style="width: 44%" />
</colgroup>
<thead>
<tr class="header">
<th>Name type</th>
<th>Good names</th>
<th>Bad names</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td><code>typevar</code></td>
<td><code>T</code>, <code>_CallableT</code>, <code>_T_co</code>, <code>AnyStr</code>, <code>DeviceTypeT</code>, <code>IPAddressT</code></td>
<td><code>DICT_T</code>, <code>CALLABLE_T</code>, <code>ENUM_T</code>, <code>DeviceType</code>, <code>_StrType</code></td>
</tr>
<tr class="even">
<td><code>typealias</code></td>
<td><dl>
<dt><code>GoodName</code>, <code>_GoodName</code>, <code>IPAddressType</code>,</dt>
<dd><p><code>GoodName2</code> and other PascalCase variants that don't start with <code>T</code> or <code>Type</code>. This is to distinguish them from <code>typevars</code>. Note that <code>TopName</code> is allowed but <code>TTopName</code> isn't.</p>
</dd>
</dl></td>
<td><dl>
<dt><code>BadNameT</code>, <code>badName</code>, <code>TBadName</code>, <code>TypeBadName</code>,</dt>
<dd><p><code>_1BadName</code></p>
</dd>
</dl></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

Before pylint 3.0, most predefined patterns also enforced a minimum length of three characters. If this behavior is desired in versions 3.0 and following, it can be had by providing custom regular expressions as described next. (Or, if the `disallowed-name` check is sufficient instead of `invalid-name`, providing the single option `bad-names-rgxs="^..?$"` will suffice to fail 1-2 character names.

# Custom regular expressions

If predefined naming styles are too limited, checker behavior may be further customized. For each name type, a separate regular expression matching valid names of this type can be defined. If any of custom regular expressions are defined, it overrides `*-naming-style` option value.

Regular expressions for the names are anchored at the beginning, any anchor for the end must be supplied explicitly. Any name not matching the regular expression will lead to an instance of `invalid-name`.

<div class="option">

\--module-rgx=\<regex\>

# Multiple naming styles for custom regular expressions

Large code bases that have been worked on for multiple years often exhibit an evolution in style as well. In some cases, modules can be in the same package, but still have different naming style based on the stratum they belong to. However, intra-module consistency should still be required, to make changes inside a single file easier. For this case, Pylint supports regular expression with several named capturing group.

Rather than emitting name warnings immediately, Pylint will determine the prevalent naming style inside each module and enforce it on all names.

Consider the following (simplified) example:

    pylint --function-rgx='(?:(?P<snake>[a-z_]+)|(?P<camel>[a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]*)*))$' sample.py

The regular expression defines two naming styles, `snake` for snake-case names, and `camel` for camel-case names.

In `sample.py`, the function name on line 1 and 7 will mark the module and enforce the match of named group `snake` for the remaining names in the module:

    def valid_snake_case(arg):
       ...
    
    def InvalidCamelCase(arg):
       ...
    
    def more_valid_snake_case(arg):
     ...

Because of this, the name on line 4 will trigger an `invalid-name` warning, even though the name matches the given regex.

Matches named `exempt` or `ignore` can be used for non-tainting names, to prevent built-in or interface-dictated names to trigger certain naming styles.

<div class="option">

\--name-group=\<name1:name2:...,...\>

Default value: empty

Format: comma-separated groups of colon-separated names.

This option can be used to combine name styles. For example, `function:method` enforces that functions and methods use the same style, and a style triggered by either name type carries over to the other. This requires that the regular expression for the combined name types use the same group names.

</div>

# Name Hints

<div class="option">

\--include-naming-hint=y|n

Default: off

Include a hint (regular expression used) for the correct name format with every `invalid-name` warning.

</div>

If you are getting the dreaded `no-member` error, there is a possibility that either:

  - pylint found a bug in your code
  - You're launching pylint without the dependencies installed in its environment
  - pylint would need to lint a C extension module and is refraining to do so
  - pylint does not understand dynamically generated code

Linting C extension modules is not supported out of the box, especially since pylint has no way to get an AST object out of the extension module.

But pylint actually has a mechanism which you might use in case you want to analyze C extensions. Pylint has a flag, called `extension-pkg-allow-list` (formerly `extension-pkg-whitelist`), through which you can tell it to import that module and to build an AST from that imported module:

    $ pylint --extension-pkg-allow-list=your_c_extension

Be aware though that using this flag means that extensions are loaded into the active Python interpreter and may run arbitrary code, which you may not want. This is the reason why we disable by default loading C extensions. In case you do not want the hassle of passing C extensions module with this flag all the time, you can enable `unsafe-load-any-extension` in your configuration file, which will build AST objects from all the C extensions that pylint encounters:

    $ pylint --unsafe-load-any-extension=y

Alternatively, since pylint emits a separate error for attributes that cannot be found in C extensions, `c-extension-no-member`, you can disable this error for your project.

If something is generated dynamically, pylint won't be able to understand the code from your library (c-extension or not). You can then specify generated attributes with the `generated-members` option. For example if `cv2.LINE_AA` and `sphinx.generated_member` create false positives for `no-member`, you can do:

    $ pylint --generated-member=cv2.LINE_AA,sphinx.generated_member

You can use `assert_never` to mark exhaustive choices:

``` python
from typing import assert_never

def handle_date_suffix(suffix):
    if suffix == "d":
        ...
    elif suffix == "m":
        ...
    elif suffix == "y":
        ...
    else:
        assert_never(suffix)

if suffix in "dmy":
    handle_date_suffix(suffix)
```

Or, instead of <span class="title-ref">assert\_never()</span>, you can call a function with a return annotation of <span class="title-ref">Never</span> or <span class="title-ref">NoReturn</span>. Unlike in the general case, where by design pylint ignores type annotations and does its own static analysis, here, pylint treats these special annotations like a disable comment.

Pylint currently allows repeating the same test like this, even though this lets some error cases through, as pylint does not assess the intervening code:

``` python
if guarded():
    var = 1

# what if code here affects the result of guarded()?

if guarded():
    print(var)
```

But this exception is limited to the repeating the exact same test. This warns:

``` python
if guarded():
    var = 1

if guarded() or other_condition:
    print(var)  # [possibly-used-before-assignment]
```

If you find this surprising, consider that pylint, as a static analysis tool, does not know if `guarded()` is deterministic or talks to a database. For variables (e.g. `guarded` versus `guarded()`), this is less of an issue, so in this case, `possibly-used-before-assignment` acts more like a future-proofing style preference than an error, per se.

When a module has too many lines it can make it difficult to read and understand. There might be performance issue while editing the file because the IDE must parse more code. You need more expertise to navigate the file properly (go to a particular line when debugging, or search for a specific code construct, instead of navigating by clicking and scrolling)

This measure is a proxy for higher cyclomatic complexity that you might not be calculating if you're not using `load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe,`. Cyclomatic complexity is slower to compute, but also a more fine grained measure than raw SLOC. In particular, you can't make the code less readable by making a very complex one liner if you're using cyclomatic complexity.

The example simplify the code, but it's not always possible. Most of the time bursting the file by creating a package with the same API is the only solution. Anticipating and creating the file from the get go will permit to have the same end result with a better version control history.

Good function signatures don’t have many positional parameters. For almost all interfaces, comprehensibility suffers beyond a handful of arguments.

There are a few exceptions where four or more positional parameters make sense, for example `rgba(1.0, 0.5, 0.3, 1.0)`, because it uses a very well-known and well-established convention, and using keywords all the time would be a waste of time.

Having too many public methods is an indication that you might not be respecting the Single-responsibility principle (S of SOLID).

The class should have only one reason to change, but in the example the spaceship has at least 4 persons that could ask for change to it (laser manager, shield manager, missile manager, teleportation officer...).

There is a legitimate use case for re-raising immediately. E.g. with the following inheritance tree:

    +-- ArithmeticError
         +-- FloatingPointError
         +-- OverflowError
         +-- ZeroDivisionError

The following code shows valid case for re-raising exception immediately:

    def execute_calculation(a, b):
        try:
            return some_calculation(a, b)
        except ZeroDivisionError:
            raise
        except ArithmeticError:
            return float('nan')

The pylint is able to detect this case and does not produce error.

At the moment, this check only works for `Generator` and `AsyncGenerator`.

Starting with Python 3.13, the `SendType` and `ReturnType` default to `None`. As such it's no longer necessary to specify them. The `collections.abc` variants don't validate the number of type arguments. Therefore the defaults for these can be used in earlier versions as well.

One of your options is not recognized. There's nothing to change in your code, but your pylint configuration or the way you launch pylint needs to be modified.

For example, this message would be raised when invoking pylint with `pylint --unknown-option=yes test.py`. Or you might be launching pylint with the following `toml` configuration:

    [tool.pylint]
    jars = "10"

When the following should be used:

    [tool.pylint]
    jobs = "10"

This warning was released in pylint 2.14: bad options were silently failing before.

By using a generator you can cut the execution tree and exit directly at the first element that is `False` for `all` or `True` for `any` instead of calculating all the elements. Except in the worst possible case where you still need to evaluate everything (all values are True for `all` or all values are false for `any`) performance will be better.

`yield from` can be thought of as removing the intermediary (your for loop) between the function caller and the requested generator. This enables the caller to directly communicate with the generator (e.g. using `send()`). This communication is not possible when manually yielding each element one by one in a loop.

PEP 380 describes the possibility of adding optimizations specific to `yield from`. It looks like they have not been implemented as of the time of writing. Even without said optimizations, the following snippet shows that `yield from` is marginally faster.

`` `sh $ python3 -m timeit "def yield_from(): yield from range(100)" "for _ in yield_from(): pass" 100000 loops, best of 5: 2.44 usec per loop $ python3 -m timeit "def yield_loop():" "    for item in range(100): yield item" "for _ in yield_loop(): pass" 100000 loops, best of 5: 2.49 usec per loop ``\`

# API

You can call `Pylint`, `symilar` and `pyreverse` from another Python program thanks to their APIs:

``` python
from pylint import run_pylint, run_pyreverse, run_symilar

run_pylint("--disable=C", "myfile.py")
run_pyreverse(...)
run_symilar(...)
```

# Pylint

## As you would launch the command line

You can use the `run_pylint` function, which is the same function called by the command line (using `sys.argv`). You can supply arguments yourself:

``` python
from pylint import run_pylint

run_pylint(argv=["--disable=line-too-long", "myfile.py"])
```

## Recover the result in a stream

You can also use `pylint.lint.Run` directly if you want to do something that can't be done using only pylint's command line options. Here's the basic example:

``` python
from pylint.lint import Run

Run(argv=["--disable=line-too-long", "myfile.py"])
```

With `Run` it is possible to invoke pylint programmatically with a reporter initialized with a custom stream:

``` python
from io import StringIO

from pylint.lint import Run
from pylint.reporters.text import TextReporter

pylint_output = StringIO()  # Custom open stream
reporter = TextReporter(pylint_output)
Run(["test_file.py"], reporter=reporter, exit=False)
print(pylint_output.getvalue())  # Retrieve and print the text report
```

The reporter can accept any stream object as as parameter. In this example, the stream outputs to a file:

``` python
from pylint.lint import Run
from pylint.reporters.text import TextReporter

with open("report.out", "w") as f:
    reporter = TextReporter(f)
    Run(["test_file.py"], reporter=reporter, exit=False)
```

This would be useful to capture pylint output in an open stream which can be passed onto another program.

If your program expects that the files being linted might be edited between runs, you will need to clear pylint's inference cache:

``` python
from pylint.lint import pylinter
pylinter.MANAGER.clear_cache()
```

## Creating a pull request

Got a change for Pylint? Below are a few steps you should take to make sure your patch gets accepted:

  - You must use at least Python 3.8 for development of Pylint as it gives you access to the latest `ast` parser and some pre-commit hooks do not support python 3.7.
  - Install the dev dependencies, see \[contributor\_install\](\#contributor\_install).
  - Use our test suite and write new tests, see \[contributor\_testing\](\#contributor\_testing).

<!-- end list -->

  - Document your change, if it is a non-trivial one:
      - A maintainer might label the issue `skip-news` if the change does not need to be in the changelog.
      - Otherwise, create a news fragment with `towncrier create <IssueNumber>.<type>` which will be included in the changelog. `<type>` can be one of the types defined in <span class="title-ref">./towncrier.toml</span>. If necessary you can write details or offer examples on how the new change is supposed to work.
      - Generating the doc is done with `tox -e docs`
  - Send a pull request from GitHub (see [About pull requests](https://support.github.com/features/pull-requests) for more insight about this topic).
  - Write comprehensive commit messages and/or a good description of what the PR does. Relate your change to an issue in the tracker if such an issue exists (see [Closing issues via commit messages](https://github.blog/2013-01-22-closing-issues-via-commit-messages/) of the GitHub documentation for more information on this)
  - Keep the change small, separate the consensual changes from the opinionated one.
      - Don't hesitate to open multiple PRs if the change requires it. If your review is so big it requires to actually plan and allocate time to review, it's more likely that it's going to go stale.
      - Maintainers might have multiple 5 to 10 minutes review windows per day, Say while waiting for their teapot to boil, or for their partner to recover from their hilarious nerdy joke, but only one full hour review time per week, if at all.
  - If you used multiple emails or multiple names when contributing, add your mails and preferred name in the `script/.contributors_aliases.json` file.

## Tips for Getting Started with Pylint Development

  - Read the \[technical-reference\](\#technical-reference). It gives a short walk through of the pylint codebase and will help you identify where you will need to make changes for what you are trying to implement.
  - `astroid.extract_node` is your friend. Most checkers are AST based, so you will likely need to interact with `astroid`. A short example of how to use `astroid.extract_node` is given \[here \<astroid\_extract\_node\>\](\#here-\<astroid\_extract\_node\>).
  - When fixing a bug for a specific check, search the code for the warning message to find where the warning is raised, and therefore where the logic for that code exists.
  - When adding a new checker class you can use the `get_unused_message_id_category.py` script in `./script` to get a message id that is not used by any of the other checkers.

## Building the documentation

You can use the makefile in the doc directory with `make html` to build the documentation. To test smaller changes you can consider `build-html`, which skips some checks but will be faster:

    $ cd doc
    $ make install-dependencies
    $ make html

We're reusing generated files for speed, use `make clean` when you want to start from scratch.

## How to choose the target version ?

Choose depending on the kind of change you're doing:

  - In **patch release** (`1.2.3`), we only fix false positives and crashes.
  - In **minor releases** (`1.2.0`), we add checks, remove checks, drop python interpreters past end of life, upgrade astroid minor/major versions and fix false negatives.
  - In **major releases** (`1.0.0`) we change everything else (pylint options, json output, dev API...) while still trying to minimize disruption.

# Governance

## How to become part of the project ?

### How to become a contributor ?

  - Follow the code of conduct
  - Search by yourself before asking for help
  - Open an issue
  - Investigate an issue and report your finding
  - Open a merge request directly if you feel it's a consensual change

Reporting a bug is being a contributor already.

### How to become a triager ?

  - Create a pylint plugin, then migrate it to the 'pylint-dev' github organization.

Or:

  - Contribute for more than 3 releases consistently.
  - Do not be too opinionated, follow the code of conduct without requiring emotional works from the maintainers. It does not mean that disagreements are impossible, only that arguments should stay technical and reasonable so the conversation is civil and productive.
  - Have a maintainer suggest that you become triager, without you asking
  - Get unanimous approval or neutral agreement from current maintainers.

### How to become a maintainer ?

  - Take ownership of a part of the code that is not maintained well at the moment or that you contributed personally (if we feel we can't merge something without your review, you're going to be able to merge those yourself soon).

Or:

  - Contribute two big code merge requests over multiple releases (for example one checker in 2.13 and the following bug after release and one complicated bug fixes in 2.14). Otherwise contributing for more than 3 releases consistently with great technical and interpersonal skills.
  - Triage for multiple months (close duplicate, clean up issues, answer questions...)
  - Have an admin suggest that you become maintainer, without you asking
  - Get unanimous approval or neutral agreement from current maintainers.

### How to become an admin ?

  - Contribute for several hundreds of commits over a long period of time with excellent interpersonal skills and code quality.
  - Maintain pylint for multiple years (code review, triaging and maintenance tasks).
  - At this point probably have another admin leave the project or become inactive for years.
  - Have an admin suggest that you become an admin, without you asking.
  - Get unanimous approval or neutral agreement from current admins.

## How are decisions made ?

Everyone is expected to follow the code of conduct. pylint is a do-ocracy / democracy. You're not allowed to behave poorly because you contributed a lot. But if you're not going to do the future maintenance work, your valid opinions might not be taken into account by those that will be affected by it.

### What are the fundamental tenets of pylint development?

General:

  - We favor correctness over performance, because pylint is not used primarily for its performance. Performance is still important and needs to be taken into account from the get go.
  - We then favor false negatives over false positives if correctness is impossible to achieve.
  - We try to keep the configuration sane, but if there's a hard decision to take we add an option so that pylint is multiple sizes fit all (after configuration)

Where to add a new checker or message:

  - Error messages (things that will result in an error if run) should be builtin checks, activated by default
  - Messages that are opinionated, even slightly, should be opt-in (added as \[an extension\<plugins\>\](\#an-extension\<plugins\>))
  - We don't shy away from opinionated checks (like the while checker), but there's such a thing as too opinionated, if something is too opinionated it should be an external \[pylint plugin\<plugins\>\](\#pylint-plugin\<plugins\>).

### How are disagreements handled ?

When something is not consensual users, maintainers, and admins discuss until an agreement is reached.

Depending on the difficulty of the discussion and the importance of a fast resolution, a decision can be taken:

  - Unanimously between discussion participants, contributors and maintainers (preferably)
  - By asking discussion participants for their opinions with an emoji survey in the issue and then using the majority if no maintainers feel strongly about the issue.
  - By majority of admins if no admins feel strongly about the issue.
  - By asking all users for their opinions in a new issue that will be pinned for multiple months before taking the decision if two admins feel strongly on an opposite side of the issue. Once the result is obvious the majority decision is not up for discussion anymore.

# OSS-Fuzz integration

## Platform overview

[OSS-Fuzz](https://google.github.io/oss-fuzz/) is Google's free fuzzing platform for open source software. It runs astroid's fuzz targets to help detect reliability issues that could affect astroid and Pylint.

Google provides public [build logs](https://oss-fuzz-build-logs.storage.googleapis.com/index.html#astroid) and [fuzzing stats](https://introspector.oss-fuzz.com/project-profile?project=astroid), but most of the details about bug reports and fuzzed testcases require approved access.

### Gaining access

The configuration files for the OSS-Fuzz integration can be found in the [OSS-Fuzz repository](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/tree/master/projects/astroid). The `project.yaml` file controls who has access to bug reports and testcases. Ping the maintainers if you'd like to be added to the list (note: a Google account is required for access).

## Fuzzing progress

Once you have access to OSS-Fuzz, you can log in to <https://oss-fuzz.com/> with your Google account to see a dashboard of astroid's fuzzing progress.

### Testcases

The dashboard contains a link to a [testcases page](https://oss-fuzz.com/testcases?project=astroid&open=yes) that lists all testcases that currently trigger a bug in astroid.

Every testcase has a dedicated page with links to view and download a minimized testcase for reproducing the failure. Each testcase page also contains a stacktrace for the failure and stats about how often the failure is encountered while fuzzing.

#### Reproducing a failure

You can download a minimized testcase and run it locally to debug a failure on your machine. For example, to reproduce a failure with the `fuzz_parse` fuzz target, you can run the following commands:

``` bash
# Note: Atheris doesn't support Python 3.12+ yet:
# https://github.com/google/atheris/issues/82
mkdir fuzzing-repro
cd fuzzing-repro

pyenv install --skip-existing 3.11
pyenv shell 3.11

python -m venv .venv-fuzzing-repro
source .venv-fuzzing-repro/bin/activate

git clone https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid.git
cd astroid

pip install atheris
pip install --editable .

# Save the minimized testcase as `minimized.py` in the astroid directory

cat << EOF > ./run_fuzz_parse.py

import astroid
import atheris

with open('minimized.py', 'rb') as f:
    fdp = atheris.FuzzedDataProvider(f.read())

code = fdp.ConsumeUnicodeNoSurrogates(fdp.ConsumeIntInRange(0, 4096))
astroid.builder.parse(code)
EOF

python ./run_fuzz_parse.py
```

If the failure does not reproduce locally, you can try reproducing the issue in an OSS-Fuzz container:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
cd oss-fuzz

python infra/helper.py build_image astroid
python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers astroid
python infra/helper.py reproduce astroid fuzz_parse minimized.py
```

Some failures may only be reproducible in an OSS-Fuzz container because of differences in Python versions between the OSS-Fuzz platform and your local environment.

### Code coverage

The dashboard also links to code coverage data for individual fuzz targets and combined code coverage data for all targets (click on the "TOTAL COVERAGE" link for the combined data).

The combined coverage data is helpful for identifying coverage gaps, insufficient corpus data, and potential candidates for future fuzz targets.

### Bug reports

Bug reports for new failures are automatically filed in the OSS-Fuzz bug tracker with an [astroid label](https://issues.oss-fuzz.com/issues?q=project:astroid%20status:open). Make sure you are logged in to view all existing issues.

## Build maintenance

Google runs compiled fuzz targets on Google Compute Engine VMs. This architecture requires each project to provide a `Dockerfile` and `build.sh` script to download code, configure dependencies, compile fuzz targets, and package any corpus files.

astroid's build files and fuzz-target code can be found in the [OSS-Fuzz repo](https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz/blob/master/projects/astroid/).

If dependencies change or if new fuzz targets are added, then you may need to modify the build files and build a new Docker image for OSS-Fuzz.

### Building an image

Run the following commands to build astroid's OSS-Fuzz image and fuzz targets:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/google/oss-fuzz.git
cd oss-fuzz

python infra/helper.py build_image astroid
python infra/helper.py build_fuzzers astroid
```

Any changes you make to the build files must be submitted as pull requests to the OSS-Fuzz repo.

#### Debugging build failures

You can debug build failures during the `build_fuzzers` stage by creating a container and manually running the `compile` command:

``` bash
# Create a container for building fuzz targets
python infra/helper.py shell astroid

# Run this command inside the container to build the fuzz targets
compile
```

The `build.sh` script will be located at `/src/build.sh` inside the container.

# Profiling and performance analysis

## Performance analysis for Pylint

To analyse the performance of Pylint we recommend to use the `cProfile` module from `stdlib`. Together with the `pstats` module this should give you all the tools you need to profile a Pylint run and see which functions take how long to run.

The documentation for both modules can be found at [cProfile](https://docs.python.org/3/library/profile.html).

To profile a run of Pylint over itself you can use the following code and run it from the base directory. Note that `cProfile` will create a document called `stats` that is then read by `pstats`. The human-readable output will be stored by `pstats` in `./profiler_stats`. It will be sorted by `cumulative time`:

``` python
import cProfile
import pstats
import sys

sys.argv = ["pylint", "pylint"]
cProfile.run("from pylint import __main__", "stats")

with open("profiler_stats", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    stats = pstats.Stats("stats", stream=file)
    stats.sort_stats("cumtime")
    stats.print_stats()
```

You can also interact with the stats object by sorting or restricting the output. For example, to only print functions from the `pylint` module and sort by cumulative time you could use:

``` python
import cProfile
import pstats
import sys

sys.argv = ["pylint", "pylint"]
cProfile.run("from pylint import __main__", "stats")

with open("profiler_stats", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    stats = pstats.Stats("stats", stream=file)
    stats.sort_stats("cumtime")
    stats.print_stats("pylint/pylint")
```

Lastly, to profile a run over your own module or code you can use:

``` python
import cProfile
import pstats
import sys

sys.argv = ["pylint", "your_dir/your_file"]
cProfile.run("from pylint import __main__", "stats")

with open("profiler_stats", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
    stats = pstats.Stats("stats", stream=file)
    stats.sort_stats("cumtime")
    stats.print_stats()
```

The documentation of the `pstats` module discusses other possibilities to interact with the profiling output.

## Performance analysis of a specific checker

To analyse the performance of specific checker within Pylint we can use the human-readable output created by `pstats`.

If you search in the `profiler_stats` file for the file name of the checker you will find all functional calls from functions within the checker. Let's say we want to check the `visit_importfrom` method of the `variables` checker:

    ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
    622    0.006    0.000    8.039    0.013 /MY_PROGRAMMING_DIR/pylint/pylint/checkers/variables.py:1445(visit_importfrom)

The previous line tells us that this method was called 622 times during the profile and we were inside the function itself for 6 ms in total. The time per call is less than a millisecond (0.006 / 622) and thus is displayed as being 0.

Often you are more interested in the cumulative time (per call). This refers to the time spent within the function and any of the functions it called or the functions they called (etc.). In our example, the `visit_importfrom` method and all of its child-functions took a little over 8 seconds to execute, with an execution time of 0.013 ms per call.

You can also search the `profiler_stats` for an individual function you want to check. For example `_analyse_fallback_blocks`, a function called by `visit_importfrom` in the `variables` checker. This allows more detailed analysis of specific functions:

    ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)
    1    0.000    0.000    0.000    0.000 /MY_PROGRAMMING_DIR/pylint/pylint/checkers/variables.py:1511(_analyse_fallback_blocks)

## Parsing the profiler stats with other tools

Often you might want to create a visual representation of your profiling stats. A good tool to do this is [gprof2dot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot). This tool can create a `.dot` file from the profiling stats created by `cProfile` and `pstats`. You can then convert the `.dot` file to a `.png` file with one of the many converters found online.

You can read the [gprof2dot](https://github.com/jrfonseca/gprof2dot) documentation for installation instructions for your specific environment.

Another option would be [snakeviz](https://jiffyclub.github.io/snakeviz/).

# Releasing a pylint version

So, you want to release the `X.Y.Z` version of pylint ?

## Releasing a major or minor version

**Before releasing a major or minor version check if there are any unreleased commits on the maintenance branch. If so, release a last patch release first. See \`\`Releasing a patch version\`\`.**

  - Write the `Summary -- Release highlights` in `doc/whatsnew` and upgrade the release date.
  - Install the release dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements_test.txt`
  - Bump the version and release by using `tbump X.Y.0 --no-push --no-tag`. (For example: `tbump 2.4.0 --no-push --no-tag`)
  - Check the commit created with `git show` amend the commit if required.
  - Move the `main` branch up to a dev version with `tbump`:

<!-- end list -->

``` bash
tbump X.Y+1.0-dev0 --no-tag --no-push  # You can interrupt after the first step
git commit -am "Upgrade the version to x.y+1.0-dev0 following x.y.0 release"
```

For example:

``` bash
tbump 2.5.0-dev0 --no-tag --no-push
git commit -am "Upgrade the version to 2.5.0-dev0 following 2.4.0 release"
```

  - tbump will have created a new `What's new in Pylint X.Y+1` document. Add it to `doc/whatsnew/3/index.rst`. Take a look at the examples from `doc/whatsnew`. Commit that with `git commit -a --amend`.
  - Push to a release branch
  - Open a merge request with the two commits (no one can push directly on `main`)
  - After the merge, recover the merged commits on `main` and tag the first one (the version should be `X.Y.Z`) as `vX.Y.Z` (For example: `v2.4.0`)
  - Push the tag.
  - Release the version on GitHub with the same name as the tag and copy and paste the appropriate changelog in the description. This triggers the PyPI release.
  - Create a `maintenance/X.Y.x` (For example: `maintenance/2.4.x` from the `v2.4.0` tag.)
  - Upgrade the pattern for the protected branches in the settings under `Branches` / `Branch protection rules`. (For example: `maintenance/2.4*` instead of `maintenance/2.3*`.). There’s a lot of configuration done in these settings, do NOT recreate it from scratch.
  - Delete the `maintenance/X.Y-1.x` branch. (For example: `maintenance/2.3.x`)
  - Select all the *closed* issues labelled `backport maintenance/X.Y-1.x` and label them `backported`, then rename the `backport maintenance/X.Y-1.x` label to `backport maintenance/X.Y.x` (for example rename `backport maintenance/2.3.x` to `backport maintenance/2.4.x`)
  - Close the current milestone and create the new ones (For example: close `2.4.0`, create `2.4.1` and `2.6.0`)
  - Hide and deactivate all the patch releases for the previous minor release on [readthedocs](https://readthedocs.org/projects/pylint/versions/), except the last one. (For example: hide `v2.4.0`, `v2.4.1`, `v2.4.2` and keep only `v2.4.3`)

## Back-porting a fix from `main` to the maintenance branch

Whenever a PR on `main` should be released in a patch release on the current maintenance branch:

  - Label the PR with `backport maintenance/X.Y-1.x`. (For example `backport maintenance/2.3.x`)
  - Squash the PR before merging (alternatively rebase if there’s a single commit)
  - (If the automated cherry-pick has conflicts)
      - Add a `Needs backport` label and do it manually.
      - You might alternatively also:
          - Cherry-pick the changes that create the conflict if it’s not a new feature before doing the original PR cherry-pick manually.
          - Decide to wait for the next minor to release the PR
          - In any case upgrade the milestones in the original PR and newly cherry-picked PR to match reality.
  - Release a patch version

## Releasing a patch version

We release patch versions when a crash or a bug is fixed on the main branch and has been cherry-picked on the maintenance branch.

  - Install the release dependencies: `pip3 install -r requirements_test.txt`
  - Bump the version and release by using `tbump X.Y-1.Z --no-push`. (For example: `tbump 2.3.5 --no-push`)
  - Check the result visually with `git show`.
  - Open a merge request of `release-X.Y-1.Z'` in `maintenance/X.Y.x` (For example: `release-2.3.5-branch` in `maintenance/2.3.x`) to run the CI tests for this branch.
  - Create and push the tag.
  - Release the version on GitHub with the same name as the tag and copy and paste the changelog from the ReadtheDoc generated documentation from the pull request pipeline in the description. This triggers the PyPI release.
  - Merge the `maintenance/X.Y.x` branch on the main branch. The main branch should have the changelog for `X.Y-1.Z+1` (For example `v2.3.6`). This merge is required so `pre-commit autoupdate` works for pylint.
  - Fix version conflicts properly, or bump the version to `X.Y.0-devZ` (For example: `2.4.0-dev6`) before pushing on the main branch
  - Close the current milestone and create the new one (For example: close `2.3.5`, create `2.3.6`)

## Milestone handling

We move issues that were not done to the next milestone and block releases only if there are any open issues labelled as `blocker`.

# Contributor installation

## Basic installation

Pylint is developed using the [git](https://git-scm.com/) distributed version control system.

You can clone Pylint using :

    git clone https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint

Before you start testing your code, you need to install your source-code package locally. Suppose you just cloned pylint with the previous `git clone` command. To set up your environment for testing, open a terminal and run:

    cd pylint
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements_test_min.txt
    pip install -e .

This ensures your testing environment is similar to Pylint's testing environment on GitHub.

**Optionally** (Because there's an auto-fix if you open a merge request): We have pre-commit hooks which should take care of the autoformatting for you before each commit. To enable it, run `pre-commit install` in the `pylint` root directory.

**Even more optionally**: You can enable slow on push hooks with `pre-commit install --install-hooks -t pre-push`. It will do slow checks like checking that the generated documentation is up to date before each push.

## Astroid installation

If you're testing new changes in astroid you need to also clone [astroid](https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid) and install with an editable installation alongside pylint as follows:

    # Suppose you're in the pylint directory
    git clone https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid.git
    python3 -m pip install -e astroid/

You're now using the local astroid in pylint and can control the version with git for example:

    cd astroid/
    git switch my-astroid-dev-branch

# Launching tests

## pytest

Since we use [pytest](#pytest) to run the tests, you can also use it on its own. We do recommend using the [tox](#tox) command though:

    pytest tests/ -k test_functional

You can use [pytest](#pytest) directly. If you want to run tests on a specific portion of the code with [pytest](#pytest) and your local python version:

    python3 -m pytest

Everything in tests/message with coverage for the relevant code (require [pytest-cov](https://pypi.org/project/pytest-cov/)):

    python3 -m pytest tests/message/ --cov=pylint.message
    coverage html

Only the functional test "missing\_kwoa\_py3":

    python3 -m pytest "tests/test_functional.py::test_functional[missing_kwoa_py3]"

## tox

You can also *optionally* install [tox](#tox) and run our tests using the [tox](#tox) package, as in:

    python -m tox
    python -m tox -epy312 # for Python 3.12 suite only
    python -m tox -epylint # for running Pylint over Pylint's codebase
    python -m tox -eformatting # for running formatting checks over Pylint's codebase

It's usually a good idea to run [tox](#tox) with `--recreate`. This flag tells [tox](#tox) to re-download all dependencies before running the tests. This can be important when a new version of [astroid](https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid) or any of the other dependencies has been published:

    python -m tox --recreate # The entire tox environment will be recreated
    python -m tox --recreate -e py310 # The python 3.10 tox environment will be recreated

To run only a specific test suite, use a pattern for the test filename (**without** the `.py` extension), as in:

    python -m tox -e py310 -- -k test_functional
    python -m tox -e py310 -- -k  \*func\*
    python -m tox --recreate -e py310 -- -k test_functional # With recreation of the environment

## Primer tests

Pylint also uses what we refer to as `primer` tests. These are tests that are run automatically in our Continuous Integration and check whether any changes in Pylint lead to crashes or fatal errors on the `stdlib`, and also assess a pull request's impact on the linting of a selection of external repositories by posting the diff against `pylint`'s current output as a comment.

To run the primer test for the `stdlib`, which only checks for crashes and fatal errors, you can add `--primer-stdlib` to the [pytest](#pytest) command. For example:

    pytest -m primer_stdlib --primer-stdlib

To produce the output generated on Continuous Integration for the linting of external repositories, run these commands:

    python tests/primer/__main__.py prepare --clone
    python tests/primer/__main__.py run --type=pr

To fully simulate the process on Continuous Integration, you should then checkout `main`, and then run these commands:

    python tests/primer/__main__.py run --type=main
    python tests/primer/__main__.py compare

The list of repositories is created on the basis of three criteria: 1) projects need to use a diverse range of language features, 2) projects need to be well maintained and 3) projects should not have a codebase that is too repetitive. This guarantees a good balance between speed of our CI and finding potential bugs.

You can find the latest list of repositories and any relevant code for these tests in the `tests/primer` directory.

# Writing tests

Pylint uses three types of tests: unittests, functional tests and primer tests.

  - \[unittests \<writing\_unittests\>\](\#unittests-\<writing\_unittests\>) can be found in `pylint/tests`. Unless you're working on pylint's internal you're probably not going to have to write any.
  - \[Global functional tests \<writing\_functional\_tests\>\](\#global-functional-tests-\<writing\_functional\_tests\>) can be found in the `pylint/tests/functional`. They are mainly used to test whether Pylint emits the correct messages.
  - \[Configuration's functional tests \<writing\_config\_functional\_tests\>\](\#configuration's-functional-tests-\<writing\_config\_functional\_tests\>) can be found in the `pylint/tests/config/functional`. They are used to test Pylint's configuration loading.
  - \[Primer tests \<primer\_tests\>\](\#primer-tests-\<primer\_tests\>) you can suggest a new external repository to check but there's nothing to do most of the time.

## Unittest tests

Most other tests reside in the '/pylint/test' directory. These unittests can be used to test almost all functionality within Pylint. A good step before writing any new unittests is to look at some tests that test a similar functionality. This can often help write new tests.

If your new test requires any additional files you can put those in the `/pylint/test/regrtest_data` directory. This is the directory we use to store any data needed for the unittests.

## Functional tests

These are located under `/pylint/test/functional` and they are formed of multiple components. First, each Python file is considered to be a test case and it should be accompanied by a `.txt` file, having the same name. The `.txt` file contains the `pylint` messages that are supposed to be emitted by the given test file.

In your `.py` test file, each line for which Pylint is supposed to emit a message has to be annotated with a comment following this pattern `# [message_symbol]`, as in:

    a, b, c = 1 # [unbalanced-tuple-unpacking]

If multiple messages are expected on the same line, then this syntax can be used:

    a, b, c = 1.test # [unbalanced-tuple-unpacking, no-member]

You can also use `# +n: [` where `n` is an integer to deal with special cases, e.g., where the above regular syntax makes the line too long:

    A = 5
    # +1: [singleton-comparison]
    B = A == None  # The test will look for the `singleton-comparison` message in this line

If you need special control over Pylint's configuration, you can also create a `.rc` file, which can set sections of Pylint's configuration. The `.rc` file can also contain a section `[testoptions]` to pass options for the functional test runner. The following options are currently supported:

  - "min\_pyver": Minimal python version required to run the test
  - "max\_pyver": Python version from which the test won't be run. If the last supported version is 3.9 this setting should be set to 3.10.
  - "min\_pyver\_end\_position": Minimal python version required to check the end\_line and end\_column attributes of the message
  - "requires": Packages required to be installed locally to run the test
  - "except\_implementations": List of python implementations on which the test should not run
  - "exclude\_platforms": List of operating systems on which the test should not run

**Functional test file locations**

For existing checkers, new test cases should preferably be appended to the existing test file. For new checkers, a new file `new_checker_message.py` should be created (Note the use of underscores). This file should then be placed in the `test/functional/n` sub-directory.

Some additional notes:

  - If the checker is part of an extension the test should go in `test/functional/ext/extension_name`
  - If the test is a regression test it should go in `test/r/regression` or `test/r/regression_02`. The file name should start with `regression_`.
  - For some sub-directories, such as `test/functional/u`, there are additional sub-directories (`test/functional/u/use`). Please check if your test file should be placed in any of these directories. It should be placed there if the sub-directory name matches the word before the first underscore of your test file name.

The folder structure is enforced when running the test suite, so you might be directed to put the file in a different sub-directory.

**Running and updating functional tests**

During development, it's sometimes helpful to run all functional tests in your current environment in order to have faster feedback. Run from Pylint root directory with:

    python tests/test_functional.py

You can use all the options you would use for [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/), for example `-k "test_functional[len_checks]"`. Furthermore, if required the .txt file with expected messages can be regenerated based on the the current output by appending `--update-functional-output` to the command line:

    python tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output -k "test_functional[len_checks]"

## Functional tests for configurations

To test the different ways to configure Pylint there is also a small functional test framework for configuration files. These tests can be found in the '/pylint/test/config' directory.

To create a new test create a new file with an unused name in the directory of that type of configuration file. Subsequently add a `filename.result.json` file with 'filename' being the same name as your configuration file. This file should record what the configuration should be **compared to the standard configuration**.

For example, if the configuration should add a warning to the list of disabled messages and you changed the configuration for `job` to 10 instead of the default 1 the `.json` file should include:

    "functional_append": {
        "disable": [["a-message-to-be-added"],]
    }
    "jobs": 10,

Similarly if a message should be removed you can add the following to the `.json` file:

    "functional_remove": {
        "disable": [["a-message-to-be-removed"],]
    }

If a configuration is incorrect and should lead to a crash or warning being emitted you can specify this by adding a `.out` file. This file should have the following name `name_of_configuration_testfile.error_code.out`. So, if your test is called `bad_configuration.toml` and should exit with exit code 2 the `.out` file should be named `bad_configuration.2.out`. The content of the `.out` file should have a similar pattern as a normal Pylint output. Note that the module name should be `{abspath}` and the file name `{relpath}`.

# How to Write a Checker

You can find some simple examples in the distribution ([custom.py](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/blob/main/examples/custom.py) , [custom\_raw.py](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/blob/main/examples/custom_raw.py) and [deprecation\_checker.py](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/blob/main/examples/deprecation_checker.py)).

There are three kinds of checkers:

  - Raw checkers, which analyse each module as a raw file stream.
  - Token checkers, which analyse a file using the list of tokens that represent the source code in the file.
  - AST checkers, which work on an AST representation of the module.

The AST representation is provided by the `astroid` library. `astroid` adds additional information and methods over `ast` in the standard library, to make tree navigation and code introspection easier.

## Writing an AST Checker

Let's implement a checker to make sure that all `return` nodes in a function return a unique constant. Firstly we will need to fill in some required boilerplate:

`` `python   import astroid   from astroid import nodes   from typing import TYPE_CHECKING, Optional    from pylint.checkers import BaseChecker    if TYPE_CHECKING:       from pylint.lint import PyLinter     class UniqueReturnChecker(BaseChecker):        name = "unique-returns"       msgs = {           "W0001": (               "Returns a non-unique constant.",               "non-unique-returns",               "All constants returned in a function should be unique.",           ),       }       options = (           (               "ignore-ints",               {                   "default": False,                   "type": "yn",                   "metavar": "<y or n>",                   "help": "Allow returning non-unique integers",               },           ),       )   So far we have defined the following required components of our checker:  * A name. The name is used to generate a special configuration    section for the checker, when options have been provided.  * A message dictionary. Each checker is being used for finding problems    in your code, the problems being displayed to the user through **messages**.    The message dictionary should specify what messages the checker is    going to emit. See `Defining a Message`_ for the details about defining a new message.  We have also defined an optional component of the checker. ``\` The options list defines any user configurable options. It has the following format:

    options = (
        ("option-symbol", {"argparse-like-kwarg": "value"}),
    )

  - The `option-symbol` is a unique name for the option. This is used on the command line and in config files. The hyphen is replaced by an underscore when used in the checker, similarly to how you would use `argparse.Namespace`:
      - \`\`\`python
        
          - if not self.linter.config.ignore\_ints:  
            ...

Next we'll track when we enter and leave a function.

``` python
def __init__(self, linter: Optional["PyLinter"] = None) -> None:
    super().__init__(linter)
    self._function_stack = []

def visit_functiondef(self, node: nodes.FunctionDef) -> None:
    self._function_stack.append([])

def leave_functiondef(self, node: nodes.FunctionDef) -> None:
    self._function_stack.pop()
```

In the constructor we initialise a stack to keep a list of return nodes `` ` for each function. An AST checker is a visitor, and should implement ``[visit]()\<lowered class name\>`or`[leave]()\<lowered class name\>`methods for the nodes it's interested in. In this case we have implemented`visit\_functiondef`and`leave\_functiondef`to add a new list of return nodes for this function, and to remove the list of return nodes when we leave the function.  Finally we'll implement the check. We will define a`visit\_return`function, which is called with an`.astroid.nodes.Return`node.     We'll need to be able to figure out what attributes an`.astroid.nodes.Return`node has available. We can use`astroid.extract\_node`for this::    >>> node = astroid.extract_node("return 5")   >>> node   <Return l.1 at 0x7efe62196390>   >>> help(node)   >>> node.value   <Const.int l.1 at 0x7efe62196ef0>  We could also construct a more complete example::    >>> node_a, node_b = astroid.extract_node("""   ... def test():   ...     if True:   ...         return 5 #@   ...     return 5 #@   ... """)   >>> node_a.value   <Const.int l.4 at 0x7efe621a74e0>   >>> node_a.value.value   5   >>> node_a.value.value == node_b.value.value   True  For`astroid.extract\_node`, you can use`\#@`at the end of a line to choose which statements will be extracted into nodes.  For more information on`astroid.extract\_node``, see the `astroid documentation <https://pylint.readthedocs.io/projects/astroid/en/latest/>`_.  Now we know how to use the astroid node, we can implement our check.``\`python def visit\_return(self, node: nodes.Return) -\> None: if not isinstance(node.value, nodes.Const): return for other\_return in self.\_function\_stack\[-1\]: if node.value.value == other\_return.value.value and not ( self.linter.config.ignore\_ints and node.value.pytype() == int ): self.add\_message("non-unique-returns", node=node)

> self.\_function\_stack\[-1\].append(node)

Once we have established that the source code has failed our check, `` ` we use ``\~.BaseChecker.add\_message`to emit our failure message.  Finally, we need to register the checker with pylint. Add the`register`function to the top level of the file.`\`python def register(linter: "PyLinter") -\> None: """This required method auto registers the checker during initialization. :param linter: The linter to register the checker to. """ linter.register\_checker(UniqueReturnChecker(linter))

We are now ready to debug and test our checker\!

Debugging a Checker `` ` ------------------- It is very simple to get to a point where we can use ``pdb`. We'll need a small test case. Put the following into a Python file:`\`python def test(): if True: return 5 return 5

>   - def test2():
>     
>       - if True:  
>         return 1
>     
>     return 5

After inserting pdb into our checker and installing it, `` ` we can run pylint with only our checker::    $ pylint --load-plugins=my_plugin --disable=all --enable=non-unique-returns test.py   (Pdb)  Now we can debug our checker!  .. Note:: ``my\_plugin`refers to a module called`my\_plugin.py`.     The preferred way of making this plugin available to pylint is     by installing it as a package. This can be done either from a packaging index like`PyPI`or by installing it from a local source such as with`pip install`.      Alternatively, the plugin module can be made available to pylint by     putting this module's parent directory in your`PYTHONPATH`environment variable.      If your pylint config has an`init-hook`that modifies`sys.path`to include the module's parent directory, this     will also work, but only if either:      * the`init-hook`and the`load-plugins`list are both       defined in a configuration file, or...     * the`init-hook`is passed as a command-line argument and       the`load-plugins`list is in the configuration file      So, you cannot load a custom plugin by modifying`sys.path`if you     supply the`init-hook`in a configuration file, but pass the module name     in via`--load-plugins`on the command line.     This is because pylint loads plugins specified on command     line before loading any configuration from other sources.  Defining a Message ------------------  Pylint message is defined using the following format::     msgs = {        "E0401": ( # message id         "Unable to import %s", # template of displayed message         "import-error", # message symbol         "Used when pylint has been unable to import a module.",  # Message description         { # Additional parameters:              # message control support for the old names of the messages:             "old_names": [("F0401", "old-import-error")]             "minversion": (3, 5), # No check under this version             "maxversion": (3, 7), # No check above this version         },     ),  The message is then formatted using the`args`parameter from`add\_message`i.e. in`self.add\_message("import-error", args=module\_we\_cant\_import, node=importnode)`, the value in`module\_we\_cant\_import`say`patglib`will be interpolled and the final result will be:`Unable to import patglib`* The`message-id`should be a 4-digit number,   prefixed with a **message category**.   There are multiple message categories,   these being`C`,`W`,`E`,`F`,`R`,   standing for`Convention`,`Warning`,`Error`,`Fatal`and`Refactoring`.   The 4 digits should not conflict with existing checkers   and the first 2 digits should consistent across the checker (except shared messages).  * The`displayed-message`is used for displaying the message to the user,   once it is emitted.  * The`message-symbol`is an alias of the message id   and it can be used wherever the message id can be used.  * The`message-help`is used when calling`pylint --help-msg`.  Optionally message can contain optional extra options:  * The`old\_names`option permits to change the message id or symbol of a message without breaking the message control used on the old messages by users. The option is specified as a list   of tuples (`message-id`,`old-message-symbol`) e.g.`{"old\_names": \[("F0401", "old-import-error")\]}`.   The symbol / msgid association must be unique so if you're changing the message id the symbol also need to change and you can generally use the`old-`prefix for that.  * The`minversion`or`maxversion`options specify minimum or maximum version of python   relevant for this message. The option value is specified as tuple with major version number   as first number and minor version number as second number e.g.`{"minversion": (3, 5)}`* The`shared`option enables sharing message between multiple checkers. As mentioned   previously, normally the message cannot be shared between multiple checkers.   To allow having message shared between multiple checkers, the`shared`option must   be set to`True`.  Parallelize a Checker ---------------------`BaseChecker`has two methods`get\_map\_data`and`reduce\_map\_data`that permit to parallelize the checks when used with the`-j`option. If a checker actually needs to reduce data it should define`get\_map\_data`as returning something different than`None`and let its`reduce\_map\_data`handle a list of the types returned by`get\_map\_data`.  An example can be seen by looking at`pylint/checkers/similar.py`.  Testing a Checker ----------------- Pylint is very well suited to test driven development. You can implement the template of the checker, produce all of your test cases and check that they fail, implement the checker, then check that all of your test cases work.  Pylint provides a`pylint.testutils.CheckerTestCase`to make test cases very simple. We can use the example code that we used for debugging as our test cases.`\`python import astroid import my\_plugin import pylint.testutils

>   - class TestUniqueReturnChecker(pylint.testutils.CheckerTestCase):  
>     CHECKER\_CLASS = my\_plugin.UniqueReturnChecker
>     
>       - def test\_finds\_non\_unique\_ints(self):  
>         func\_node, return\_node\_a, return\_node\_b = astroid.extract\_node(""" def test(): \#@ if True: return 5 \#@ return 5 \#@ """)
>         
>         self.checker.visit\_functiondef(func\_node) self.checker.visit\_return(return\_node\_a) with self.assertAddsMessages( pylint.testutils.MessageTest( msg\_id="non-unique-returns", node=return\_node\_b, ), ): self.checker.visit\_return(return\_node\_b)
>     
>       - def test\_ignores\_unique\_ints(self):  
>         func\_node, return\_node\_a, return\_node\_b = astroid.extract\_node(""" def test(): \#@ if True: return 1 \#@ return 5 \#@ """)
>         
>           - with self.assertNoMessages():  
>             self.checker.visit\_functiondef(func\_node) self.checker.visit\_return(return\_node\_a) self.checker.visit\_return(return\_node\_b)

Once again we are using `astroid.extract_node` to `` ` construct our test cases. ``pylint.testutils.CheckerTestCase\`\` has created the linter and checker for us, we simply simulate a traversal of the AST tree using the nodes that we are interested in.

# How To Write a Pylint Plugin

Pylint provides support for writing two types of extensions. First, there is the concept of **checkers**, which can be used for finding problems in your code. Secondly, there is also the concept of **transform plugin**, which represents a way through which the inference and the capabilities of Pylint can be enhanced and tailored to a particular module, library of framework.

In general, a plugin is a module which should have a function `register`, which takes an instance of `pylint.lint.PyLinter` as input.

A plugin can optionally define a function, `load_configuration`, which takes an instance of `pylint.lint.PyLinter` as input. This function is called after Pylint loads configuration from configuration file and command line interface. This function should load additional plugin specific configuration to Pylint.

So a basic hello-world plugin can be implemented as:

``` python
# Inside hello_plugin.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

import astroid

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from pylint.lint import PyLinter

def register(linter: "PyLinter") -> None:
  """This required method auto registers the checker during initialization.

  :param linter: The linter to register the checker to.
  """
  print('Hello world')
```

We can run this plugin by placing this module in the PYTHONPATH and invoking **pylint** as:

``` bash
$ pylint -E --load-plugins hello_plugin foo.py
Hello world
```

We can extend hello-world plugin to ignore some specific names using `load_configuration` function:

``` python
# Inside hello_plugin.py
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

import astroid

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from pylint.lint import PyLinter

def register(linter: "PyLinter") -> None:
  """This required method auto registers the checker during initialization.

  :param linter: The linter to register the checker to.
  """
  print('Hello world')

def load_configuration(linter):

  name_checker = get_checker(linter, NameChecker)
  # We consider as good names of variables Hello and World
  name_checker.config.good_names += ('Hello', 'World')

  # We ignore bin directory
  linter.config.black_list += ('bin',)
```

Depending if we need a **transform plugin** or a **checker**, this might not be enough. For the former, this is enough to declare the module as a plugin, but in the case of the latter, we need to register our checker with the linter object, by calling the following inside the `register` function:

    linter.register_checker(OurChecker(linter))

For more information on writing a checker see \[write\_a\_checker\](\#write\_a\_checker).

# Transform plugins

## Why write a plugin?

Pylint is a static analysis tool and Python is a dynamically typed language. So there will be cases where Pylint cannot analyze files properly (this problem can happen in statically typed languages also if reflection or dynamic evaluation is used).

The plugins are a way to tell Pylint how to handle such cases, since only the user would know what needs to be done. They are usually operating on the AST level, by modifying or changing it in a way which can ease its understanding by Pylint.

## Example

Let us run Pylint on a module from the Python source: [warnings.py](https://hg.python.org/cpython/file/2.7/Lib/warnings.py) and see what happens:

``` shell
amitdev$ pylint -E Lib/warnings.py
E:297,36: Instance of 'WarningMessage' has no 'message' member (no-member)
E:298,36: Instance of 'WarningMessage' has no 'filename' member (no-member)
E:298,51: Instance of 'WarningMessage' has no 'lineno' member (no-member)
E:298,64: Instance of 'WarningMessage' has no 'line' member (no-member)
```

Did we catch a genuine error? Let's open the code and look at `WarningMessage` class:

``` python
class WarningMessage(object):

  """Holds the result of a single showwarning() call."""

  _WARNING_DETAILS = ("message", "category", "filename", "lineno", "file",
                      "line")

  def __init__(self, message, category, filename, lineno, file=None,
                  line=None):
    local_values = locals()
    for attr in self._WARNING_DETAILS:
      setattr(self, attr, local_values[attr])
    self._category_name = category.__name__ if category else None

  def __str__(self):
    ...
```

Ah, the fields (`message`, `category` etc) are not defined statically on the class. Instead they are added using `setattr`. Pylint would have a tough time figuring this out.

## Enter Plugin

We can write a transform plugin to tell Pylint how to analyze this properly.

One way to fix our example with a plugin would be to transform the `WarningMessage` class, by setting the attributes so that Pylint can see them. This can be done by registering a transform function. We can transform any node in the parsed AST like Module, Class, Function etc. In our case we need to transform a class. It can be done so:

``` python
from typing import TYPE_CHECKING

import astroid

if TYPE_CHECKING:
    from pylint.lint import PyLinter

def register(linter: "PyLinter") -> None:
  """This required method auto registers the checker during initialization.

  :param linter: The linter to register the checker to.
  """
  pass

def transform(cls):
  if cls.name == 'WarningMessage':
    import warnings
    for f in warnings.WarningMessage._WARNING_DETAILS:
      cls.locals[f] = [astroid.ClassDef(f, None)]

astroid.MANAGER.register_transform(astroid.ClassDef, transform)
```

Let's go through the plugin. First, we need to register a class transform, which is done via the `register_transform` function in `MANAGER`. It takes the node type and function as parameters. We need to change a class, so we use `astroid.ClassDef`. We also pass a `transform` function which does the actual transformation.

`transform` function is simple as well. If the class is `WarningMessage` then we add the attributes to its locals (we are not bothered about type of attributes, so setting them as class will do. But we could set them to any type we want). That's it.

Note: We don't need to do anything in the `register` function of the plugin since we are not modifying anything in the linter itself.

Lets run Pylint with this plugin and see:

``` bash
amitdev$ pylint -E --load-plugins warning_plugin Lib/warnings.py
amitdev$
```

All the false positives associated with `WarningMessage` are now gone. This is just an example, any code transformation can be done by plugins.

See [astroid/brain](https://github.com/pylint-dev/astroid/tree/main/astroid/brain) for real life examples of transform plugins.

# Checkers

All of the default pylint checkers exist in `pylint.checkers`. This is where most of pylint's brains exist. Most checkers are AST based and so use `astroid`. `pylint.checkers.utils` provides a large number of utility methods for dealing with `astroid`.

# Startup and the Linter Class

The two main classes in `pylint.lint` are `.pylint.lint.Run` and `.pylint.lint.PyLinter`.

The `.pylint.lint.Run` object is responsible for starting up pylint. It does some basic checking of the given command line options to find the initial hook to run, find the config file to use, and find which plugins have been specified. It can then create the main `.pylint.lint.PyLinter` instance and initialise it with the config file and plugins that were discovered when preprocessing the command line options. Finally the `.pylint.lint.Run` object launches any child linters for parallel jobs, and starts the linting process.

The `.pylint.lint.PyLinter` is responsible for coordinating the linting process. It parses the configuration and provides it for the checkers and other plugins, it handles the messages emitted by the checkers, it handles the output reporting, and it launches the checkers.

## What is Pylint?

Pylint is a [static code analyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis) for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python 3.9.0 and above.

Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html), and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

## Install

For command line use, pylint is installed with:

    pip install pylint

Or if you want to also check spelling with `enchant` (you might need to [install the enchant C library](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html#installing-the-enchant-c-library)):

`` `sh    pip install pylint[spelling]  It can also be integrated in most editors or IDEs. More information can be found ``<span class="title-ref"> \`in the documentation</span>\_.

## What differentiates Pylint?

Pylint is not trusting your typing and is inferring the actual values of nodes (for a start because there was no typing when pylint started off) using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is `import logging as argparse`, Pylint can check and know that `argparse.error(...)` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call. This makes pylint slower, but it also lets pylint find more issues if your code is not fully typed.

> \[inference\] is the killer feature that keeps us using \[pylint\] in our project despite how painfully slow it is. - [Realist pylint user](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/970#issuecomment-1381067064), 2022

pylint, not afraid of being a little slower than it already is, is also a lot more thorough than other linters. There are more checks, including some opinionated ones that are deactivated by default but can be enabled using configuration.

## How to use pylint

Pylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have conscientiously done or check for some things that you don't care about. During adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced, it's best to start with the `--errors-only` flag, then disable convention and refactor messages with `--disable=C,R` and progressively re-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.

Pylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your own checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint also has an ecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks and third-party libraries.

\> **Note** \> Pylint supports the Python standard library out of the box. Third-party libraries are not always supported, so a plugin might be needed. A good place to start is `PyPI` which often returns a plugin by searching for `pylint <library>`. [pylint-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-pydantic), [pylint-django](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-django) and [pylint-sonarjson](https://github.com/cnescatlab/pylint-sonarjson-catlab) are examples of such plugins. More information about plugins and how to load them can be found at [plugins](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/plugins.html#plugins).

## Advised linters alongside pylint

Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (**really** fast, with builtin auto-fix and a large number of checks taken from popular linters, but implemented in `rust`) or [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) (a framework to implement your own checks in python using `ast` directly), [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) / pylance or [pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) (typing checks), [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (security oriented checks), [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort) (auto-formatting), [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) (automated removal of unused imports or variables), [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and [pydocstringformatter](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter) (automated pep257).

## Additional tools included in pylint

Pylint ships with two additional tools:

  - [pyreverse](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/pyreverse/index.html) (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)
  - [symilar](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/symilar/index.html) (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)

## Does Pylint follow a versioning scheme?

See \[upgrading pylint in the installation guide \<upgrading\_pylint\>\](\#upgrading-pylint-in-the-installation-guide-\<upgrading\_pylint\>).

## How do I find the name corresponding to a specific command line option?

See \[the configuration documentation \<all-configurations-options\>\](\#the-configuration-documentation-\<all-configurations-options\>).

## What is the format of the configuration file?

The configuration file can be an `ini` or `toml` file. See the \[exhaustive list of possible options \<all-options\>\](\#exhaustive-list-of-possible-options-\<all-options\>).

## How to disable a particular message?

Read \[message-control\](\#message-control) for details and examples.

## Pylint gave my code a negative rating out of ten. That can't be right\!

Prior to Pylint 2.13.0, the score formula used by default had no lower bound. The new default score formula is :

    max(0, 0 if fatal else 10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10))

If your project contains a configuration file created by an earlier version of Pylint, you can set `evaluation` to the above expression to get the new behavior. Likewise, since negative values are still technically supported, `evaluation` can be set to a version of the above expression that does not enforce a floor of zero.

## How do I avoid getting unused argument warnings for API I do not control?

Prefix (ui) the callback's name by <span class="title-ref">cb\_</span> (callback), as in cb\_onclick(...). By doing so arguments usage won't be checked. Another solution is to use one of the names defined in the "dummy-variables" configuration variable for unused argument ("\_" and "dummy" by default).

## Why are there a bunch of messages disabled by default?

Either because they are prone to false positives or that they are opinionated enough to not be included as default messages.

You can see the plugin you need to explicitly \[load in the technical reference \<user\_guide/checkers/extensions:optional checkers\>\](\#load-in-the-technical-reference \<user\_guide/checkers/extensions:optional-checkers\>).

## I want to run pylint on each keystroke in my IDE. How do I do that?

Pylint full suite of checks will never be fast enough to run on every keystroke. However, some IDEs can run pylint when the IDE opens or saves files. See, for example, the [Microsoft plugin for VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-pylint#readme).

That said, pylint is best suited for linting on save for small projects, for continuous integration jobs, or a git `pre-push` hook for big projects. The larger your repository is, the slower pylint will be.

If you want to make pylint faster for this type of use case, you can use the `--errors-only` option, which will remove all the refactor, convention, and warning checks. You can also disable checks with inherently high complexity that need to analyse the full code base like `duplicate-code` or `cyclic-import` (this list is not exhaustive).

## Why do I have non-deterministic results when I try to parallelize pylint ?

pylint should analyse all your code at once in order to best infer the actual values that result from calls. If only some of the files are given, pylint might miss a particular value's type and produce inferior inference for the subset. Parallelization of pylint is not easy; we also discourage the use of the `-j` option if this matters to you.

## Which messages should I disable to avoid duplicates if I use other popular linters ?

[pycodestyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle): bad-indentation, bare-except, line-too-long, missing-final-newline, multiple-statements, singleton-comparison, trailing-newlines, trailing-whitespace, unnecessary-negation, unnecessary-semicolon, wrong-import-position

[pyflakes](https://github.com/PyCQA/pyflakes): undefined-variable, unused-import, unused-variable

[mccabe](https://github.com/PyCQA/mccabe): too-many-branches

[pydocstyle](https://github.com/PyCQA/pydocstyle): missing-module-docstring, missing-class-docstring, missing-function-docstring

[pep8-naming](https://github.com/PyCQA/pep8-naming): invalid-name, bad-classmethod-argument, bad-mcs-classmethod-argument, no-self-argument

[isort](https://github.com/pycqa/isort) and [flake8-import-order](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-import-order): ungrouped-imports, wrong-import-order

## How do I avoid "access to undefined member" messages in my mixin classes?

You should add the `no-member` message to your `ignored-checks-for-mixins` option and name your mixin class with a name which ends with "Mixin" or "mixin" (default) or change the default value by changing the `mixin-class-rgx` option.

## Where is the persistent data stored to compare between successive runs?

Analysis data are stored as a pickle file in a directory which is localized using the following rules:

  - value of the PYLINTHOME environment variable if set

  -   - "pylint" subdirectory of the user's XDG\_CACHE\_HOME if the environment variable is set, otherwise
        
          - Linux: "\~/.cache/pylint"
          - macOS: "\~/Library/Caches/pylint"
          - Windows: "C:Users\<username\>AppDataLocalpylint"

  - ".pylint.d" directory in the current directory

## What is Pylint?

Pylint is a [static code analyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis) for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python 3.9.0 and above.

Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html), and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

## Install

For command line use, pylint is installed with:

    pip install pylint

Or if you want to also check spelling with `enchant` (you might need to [install the enchant C library](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html#installing-the-enchant-c-library)):

`` `sh    pip install pylint[spelling]  It can also be integrated in most editors or IDEs. More information can be found ``<span class="title-ref"> \`in the documentation</span>\_.

## What differentiates Pylint?

Pylint is not trusting your typing and is inferring the actual values of nodes (for a start because there was no typing when pylint started off) using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is `import logging as argparse`, Pylint can check and know that `argparse.error(...)` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call. This makes pylint slower, but it also lets pylint find more issues if your code is not fully typed.

> \[inference\] is the killer feature that keeps us using \[pylint\] in our project despite how painfully slow it is. - [Realist pylint user](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/970#issuecomment-1381067064), 2022

pylint, not afraid of being a little slower than it already is, is also a lot more thorough than other linters. There are more checks, including some opinionated ones that are deactivated by default but can be enabled using configuration.

## How to use pylint

Pylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have conscientiously done or check for some things that you don't care about. During adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced, it's best to start with the `--errors-only` flag, then disable convention and refactor messages with `--disable=C,R` and progressively re-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.

Pylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your own checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint also has an ecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks and third-party libraries.

\> **Note** \> Pylint supports the Python standard library out of the box. Third-party libraries are not always supported, so a plugin might be needed. A good place to start is `PyPI` which often returns a plugin by searching for `pylint <library>`. [pylint-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-pydantic), [pylint-django](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-django) and [pylint-sonarjson](https://github.com/cnescatlab/pylint-sonarjson-catlab) are examples of such plugins. More information about plugins and how to load them can be found at [plugins](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/plugins.html#plugins).

## What is Pylint?

Pylint is a [static code analyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis) for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python 3.9.0 and above.

Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html), and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

## Install

For command line use, pylint is installed with:

    pip install pylint

Or if you want to also check spelling with `enchant` (you might need to [install the enchant C library](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html#installing-the-enchant-c-library)):

`` `sh    pip install pylint[spelling]  It can also be integrated in most editors or IDEs. More information can be found ``<span class="title-ref"> \`in the documentation</span>\_.

## What differentiates Pylint?

Pylint is not trusting your typing and is inferring the actual values of nodes (for a start because there was no typing when pylint started off) using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is `import logging as argparse`, Pylint can check and know that `argparse.error(...)` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call. This makes pylint slower, but it also lets pylint find more issues if your code is not fully typed.

> \[inference\] is the killer feature that keeps us using \[pylint\] in our project despite how painfully slow it is. - [Realist pylint user](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/970#issuecomment-1381067064), 2022

pylint, not afraid of being a little slower than it already is, is also a lot more thorough than other linters. There are more checks, including some opinionated ones that are deactivated by default but can be enabled using configuration.

## How to use pylint

Pylint isn't smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have conscientiously done or check for some things that you don't care about. During adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced, it's best to start with the `--errors-only` flag, then disable convention and refactor messages with `--disable=C,R` and progressively re-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.

Pylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your own checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint also has an ecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks and third-party libraries.

\> **Note** \> Pylint supports the Python standard library out of the box. Third-party libraries are not always supported, so a plugin might be needed. A good place to start is `PyPI` which often returns a plugin by searching for `pylint <library>`. [pylint-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-pydantic), [pylint-django](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-django) and [pylint-sonarjson](https://github.com/cnescatlab/pylint-sonarjson-catlab) are examples of such plugins. More information about plugins and how to load them can be found at [plugins](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/plugins.html#plugins).

## Advised linters alongside pylint

Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (**really** fast, with builtin auto-fix and a large number of checks taken from popular linters, but implemented in `rust`) or [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) (a framework to implement your own checks in python using `ast` directly), [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) / pylance or [pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) (typing checks), [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (security oriented checks), [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (auto-formatting), [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) (automated removal of unused imports or variables), [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and [pydocstringformatter](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter) (automated pep257).

## Additional tools included in pylint

Pylint ships with two additional tools:

  - [pyreverse](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/pyreverse/index.html) (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)
  - [symilar](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/symilar/index.html) (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)

# Tutorial

This tutorial is all about approaching coding standards with little or no knowledge of in-depth programming or the code standards themselves. It's the equivalent of skipping the manual and jumping right in.

The command line prompt for these examples is:

``` console
tutor Desktop$
```

## Getting Started

Running Pylint with the `--help` arguments will give you an idea of the arguments available. Do that now, i.e.:

``` console
pylint --help
```

A couple of the options that we'll focus on here are: :

    Commands:
      --help-msg=<msg-id>
      --generate-toml-config
    Messages control:
      --disable=<msg-ids>
    Reports:
      --reports=<y or n>
      --output-format=<format>

If you need more detail, you can also ask for an even longer help message: :

    pylint --long-help

Pay attention to the last bit of this longer help output. This gives you a hint of what Pylint is going to `pick on`: :

    Output:
       Using the default text output, the message format is :
      MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE
      There are 5 kind of message types :
      * (C) convention, for programming standard violation
      * (R) refactor, for bad code smell
      * (W) warning, for python specific problems
      * (E) error, for probable bugs in the code
      * (F) fatal, if an error occurred which prevented pylint from doing
      further processing.

When Pylint is first run on a fresh piece of code, a common complaint is that it is too `noisy`. The default configuration enforce a lot of warnings. We'll use some of the options we noted above to make it suit your preferences a bit better.

## Your First Pylint'ing

We'll use a basic Python script with `black` already applied on it, as fodder for our tutorial. The starting code we will use is called `simplecaesar.py` and is here in its entirety:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

import string

shift = 3
choice = input("would you like to encode or decode?")
word = input("Please enter text")
letters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
encoded = ""
if choice == "encode":
    for letter in word:
        if letter == " ":
            encoded = encoded + " "
        else:
            x = letters.index(letter) + shift
            encoded = encoded + letters[x]
if choice == "decode":
    for letter in word:
        if letter == " ":
            encoded = encoded + " "
        else:
            x = letters.index(letter) - shift
            encoded = encoded + letters[x]

print(encoded)
```

Let's get started. If we run this:

``` console
tutor Desktop$ pylint simplecaesar.py
************* Module simplecaesar
simplecaesar.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)
simplecaesar.py:5:0: C0103: Constant name "shift" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:8:0: C0103: Constant name "letters" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:9:0: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:13:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:15:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:16:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:20:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:22:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:23:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)

-----------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 4.74/10
```

We can see the second line is: :

    "simplecaesar.py:1:0: C0114: Missing module docstring (missing-module-docstring)"

This basically means that line 1 at column 0 violates the convention `C0114`. Another piece of information is the message symbol between parens, `missing-module-docstring`.

If we want to read up a bit more about that, we can go back to the command line and try this:

``` console
tutor Desktop$ pylint --help-msg=missing-module-docstring
:missing-module-docstring (C0114): *Missing module docstring*
  Used when a module has no docstring.Empty modules do not require a docstring.
  This message belongs to the basic checker.
```

That one was a bit of a no-brainer, but we can also run into error messages where we are unfamiliar with the underlying code theory.

## The Next Step

Now that we got some configuration stuff out of the way, let's see what we can do with the remaining warnings. If we add a docstring to describe what the code is meant to do that will help. There are `invalid-name` messages that we will get to later. Here is the updated code:

``` python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

"""This script prompts a user to enter a message to encode or decode
using a classic Caesar shift substitution (3 letter shift)"""

import string

shift = 3
choice = input("would you like to encode or decode?")
word = input("Please enter text")
letters = string.ascii_letters + string.punctuation + string.digits
encoded = ""
if choice == "encode":
    for letter in word:
        if letter == " ":
            encoded = encoded + " "
        else:
            x = letters.index(letter) + shift
            encoded = encoded + letters[x]
if choice == "decode":
    for letter in word:
        if letter == " ":
            encoded = encoded + " "
        else:
            x = letters.index(letter) - shift
            encoded = encoded + letters[x]

print(encoded)
```

Here is what happens when we run it:

``` console
tutor Desktop$ pylint simplecaesar.py
************* Module simplecaesar
simplecaesar.py:8:0: C0103: Constant name "shift" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:11:0: C0103: Constant name "letters" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:12:0: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:16:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:18:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:19:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:23:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:25:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:26:12: C0103: Constant name "encoded" doesn't conform to UPPER_CASE naming style (invalid-name)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 5.26/10 (previous run: 4.74/10, +0.53)
```

Nice\! Pylint told us how much our code rating has improved since our last run, and we're down to just the `invalid-name` messages.

There are fairly well defined conventions around naming things like instance variables, functions, classes, etc. The conventions focus on the use of UPPERCASE and lowercase as well as the characters that separate multiple words in the name. This lends itself well to checking via a regular expression, thus the **should match ((\[A-Z\_\]\[A-Z1-9\_\]\*)|(\_\_.\*\_\_))$**.

In this case Pylint is telling us that those variables appear to be constants and should be all UPPERCASE. This is an in-house convention that has lived with Pylint since its inception. You too can create your own in-house naming conventions but for the purpose of this tutorial, we want to stick to the [PEP 8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) standard. In this case, the variables we declared should follow the convention of all lowercase. The appropriate rule would be something like: "should match \[a-z\_\]\[a-z0-9\_\]{2,30}$". Notice the lowercase letters in the regular expression (a-z versus A-Z).

If we run that rule using a `--const-rgx='[a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]{2,30}$'` option, it will now be quite quiet:

``` console
tutor Desktop$ pylint simplecaesar.py --const-rgx='[a-z\_][a-z0-9\_]{2,30}$'
************* Module simplecaesar
simplecaesar.py:18:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to '[a-z\\_][a-z0-9\\_]{2,30}$' pattern (invalid-name)
simplecaesar.py:25:12: C0103: Constant name "x" doesn't conform to '[a-z\\_][a-z0-9\\_]{2,30}$' pattern (invalid-name)

------------------------------------------------------------------
Your code has been rated at 8.95/10 (previous run: 5.26/10, +3.68)
```

You can [read up](https://docs.python.org/library/re.html) on regular expressions or use [a website to help you](https://regex101.com/).

Tip

</div>

It would really be a pain to specify that regex on the command line all the time, particularly if we're using many other options. That's what a configuration file is for. We can configure our Pylint to store our options for us so we don't have to declare them on the command line. Using a configuration file is a nice way of formalizing your rules and quickly sharing them with others. Invoking `pylint --generate-toml-config` will create a sample `.toml` section with all the options set and explained in comments. This can then be added to your `pyproject.toml` file or any other `.toml` file pointed to with the `--rcfile` option.

## Broad Try Clause checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.broad_try_clause`. Verbatim name of the checker is `broad_try_clause`.

See also \[broad\_try\_clause checker's options' documentation \<broad\_try\_clause-options\>\](\#broad\_try\_clause-checker's-options'-documentation-\<broad\_try\_clause-options\>)

### Broad Try Clause checker Messages

  - too-many-try-statements (W0717)  
    Try clause contains too many statements.

## Code Style checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.code_style`. Verbatim name of the checker is `code_style`.

### Code Style checker Documentation

Checkers that can improve code consistency. As such they don't necessarily provide a performance benefit and are often times opinionated.

See also \[code\_style checker's options' documentation \<code\_style-options\>\](\#code\_style-checker's-options'-documentation-\<code\_style-options\>)

### Code Style checker Messages

  - consider-using-tuple (R6102)  
    *Consider using an in-place tuple instead of list* Only for style consistency\! Emitted where an in-place defined `list` can be replaced by a `tuple`. Due to optimizations by CPython, there is no performance benefit from it.

  - consider-using-namedtuple-or-dataclass (R6101)  
    *Consider using namedtuple or dataclass for dictionary values* Emitted when dictionary values can be replaced by namedtuples or dataclass instances.

  - prefer-typing-namedtuple (R6105)  
    *Prefer 'typing.NamedTuple' over 'collections.namedtuple'* 'typing.NamedTuple' uses the well-known 'class' keyword with type-hints for readability (it's also faster as it avoids an internal exec call). Disabled by default\!

  - consider-using-assignment-expr (R6103)  
    *Use '%s' instead* Emitted when an if assignment is directly followed by an if statement and both can be combined by using an assignment expression `:=`. Requires Python 3.8 and `py-version >= 3.8`.

  - consider-using-augmented-assign (R6104)  
    *Use '%s' to do an augmented assign directly* Emitted when an assignment is referring to the object that it is assigning to. This can be changed to be an augmented assign. Disabled by default\!

## Comparison-Placement checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.comparison_placement`. Verbatim name of the checker is `comparison-placement`.

### Comparison-Placement checker Messages

  - misplaced-comparison-constant (C2201)  
    *Comparison should be %s* Used when the constant is placed on the left side of a comparison. It is usually clearer in intent to place it in the right hand side of the comparison.

## Confusing Elif checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.confusing_elif`. Verbatim name of the checker is `confusing_elif`.

### Confusing Elif checker Messages

  - confusing-consecutive-elif (R5601)  
    *Consecutive elif with differing indentation level, consider creating a function to separate the inner elif* Used when an elif statement follows right after an indented block which itself ends with if or elif. It may not be obvious if the elif statement was willingly or mistakenly unindented. Extracting the indented if statement into a separate function might avoid confusion and prevent errors.

## Consider-Using-Any-Or-All checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.for_any_all`. Verbatim name of the checker is `consider-using-any-or-all`.

### Consider-Using-Any-Or-All checker Messages

  - consider-using-any-or-all (C0501)  
    *\`for\` loop could be \`%s\`* A for loop that checks for a condition and return a bool can be replaced with any or all.

## Consider Refactoring Into While checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.consider_refactoring_into_while_condition`. Verbatim name of the checker is `consider_refactoring_into_while`.

### Consider Refactoring Into While checker Messages

  - consider-refactoring-into-while-condition (R3501)  
    *Consider using 'while %s' instead of 'while %s:' an 'if', and a 'break'* Emitted when <span class="title-ref">while True:</span> loop is used and the first statement is a break condition. The `if / break` construct can be removed if the check is inverted and moved to the `while` statement.

## Consider Ternary Expression checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.consider_ternary_expression`. Verbatim name of the checker is `consider_ternary_expression`.

### Consider Ternary Expression checker Messages

  - consider-ternary-expression (W0160)  
    *Consider rewriting as a ternary expression* Multiple assign statements spread across if/else blocks can be rewritten with a single assignment and ternary expression

## Deprecated Builtins checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.bad_builtin`. Verbatim name of the checker is `deprecated_builtins`.

### Deprecated Builtins checker Documentation

This used to be the `bad-builtin` core checker, but it was moved to an extension instead. It can be used for finding prohibited used builtins, such as `map` or `filter`, for which other alternatives exists.

If you want to control for what builtins the checker should warn about, you can use the `bad-functions` option:

    $ pylint a.py --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.bad_builtin --bad-functions=apply,reduce
    ...

See also \[deprecated\_builtins checker's options' documentation \<deprecated\_builtins-options\>\](\#deprecated\_builtins-checker's-options'-documentation-\<deprecated\_builtins-options\>)

### Deprecated Builtins checker Messages

  - bad-builtin (W0141)  
    *Used builtin function %s* Used when a disallowed builtin function is used (see the bad-function option). Usual disallowed functions are the ones like map, or filter , where Python offers now some cleaner alternative like list comprehension.

## Design checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.mccabe`. Verbatim name of the checker is `design`.

### Design checker Documentation

You can now use this plugin for finding complexity issues in your code base.

Activate it through `pylint --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe`. It introduces a new warning, `too-complex`, which is emitted when a code block has a complexity higher than a preestablished value, which can be controlled through the `max-complexity` option, such as in this example:

    $ cat a.py
    def f10():
        """McCabe rating: 11"""
        myint = 2
        if myint == 5:
            return myint
        elif myint == 6:
            return myint
        elif myint == 7:
            return myint
        elif myint == 8:
            return myint
        elif myint == 9:
            return myint
        elif myint == 10:
            if myint == 8:
                while True:
                    return True
            elif myint == 8:
                with myint:
                    return 8
        else:
            if myint == 2:
                return myint
            return myint
        return myint
    $ pylint a.py --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe
    R:1: 'f10' is too complex. The McCabe rating is 11 (too-complex)
    $ pylint a.py --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe --max-complexity=50
    $

See also \[design checker's options' documentation \<design-options\>\](\#design-checker's-options'-documentation-\<design-options\>)

### Design checker Messages

  - too-complex (R1260)

## Parameter Documentation checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.docparams`. Verbatim name of the checker is `parameter_documentation`.

### Parameter Documentation checker Documentation

If you document the parameters of your functions, methods and constructors and their types systematically in your code this optional component might be useful for you. Sphinx style, Google style, and Numpy style are supported. (For some examples, see <https://pypi.org/project/sphinxcontrib-napoleon/> .)

You can activate this checker by adding the line:

    load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams

to the `MAIN` section of your `.pylintrc`.

This checker verifies that all function, method, and constructor docstrings include documentation of the

  - parameters and their types
  - return value and its type
  - exceptions raised

and can handle docstrings in

  - Sphinx style (`param`, `type`, `return`, `rtype`, `raise` / `except`):
    
        def function_foo(x, y, z):
            '''function foo ...
        
            :param x: bla x
            :type x: int
        
            :param y: bla y
            :type y: float
        
            :param int z: bla z
        
            :return: sum
            :rtype: float
        
            :raises OSError: bla
            '''
            return x + y + z

  - or the Google style (`Args:`, `Returns:`, `Raises:`):
    
        def function_foo(x, y, z):
            '''function foo ...
        
            Args:
                x (int): bla x
                y (float): bla y
        
                z (int): bla z
        
            Returns:
                float: sum
        
            Raises:
                OSError: bla
            '''
            return x + y + z

  - or the Numpy style (`Parameters`, `Returns`, `Raises`):
    
        def function_foo(x, y, z):
            '''function foo ...
        
            Parameters
            ----------
            x: int
                bla x
            y: float
                bla y
        
            z: int
                bla z
        
            Returns
            -------
            float
                sum
        
            Raises
            ------
            OSError
                bla
            '''
            return x + y + z

You'll be notified of **missing parameter documentation** but also of **naming inconsistencies** between the signature and the documentation which often arise when parameters are renamed automatically in the code, but not in the documentation. **Note:** by default docstrings of private and magic methods are not checked. To change this behaviour (for example, to also check `__init__`) add `no-docstring-rgx=^(?!__init__$)_` to the `BASIC` section of your `.pylintrc`.

Constructor parameters can be documented in either the class docstring or the `__init__` docstring, but not both:

    class ClassFoo(object):
        '''Sphinx style docstring foo
    
        :param float x: bla x
    
        :param y: bla y
        :type y: int
        '''
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            pass
    
    class ClassBar(object):
        def __init__(self, x, y):
            '''Google style docstring bar
    
            Args:
                x (float): bla x
                y (int): bla y
            '''
            pass

In some cases, having to document all parameters is a nuisance, for instance if many of your functions or methods just follow a **common interface**. To remove this burden, the checker accepts missing parameter documentation if one of the following phrases is found in the docstring:

  - For the other parameters, see
  - For the parameters, see

(with arbitrary whitespace between the words). Please add a link to the docstring defining the interface, e.g. a superclass method, after "see":

    def callback(x, y, z):
        '''Sphinx style docstring for callback ...
    
        :param x: bla x
        :type x: int
    
        For the other parameters, see
        `MyFrameworkUsingAndDefiningCallback`
        '''
        return x + y + z
    
    def callback(x, y, z):
        '''Google style docstring for callback ...
    
        Args:
            x (int): bla x
    
        For the other parameters, see
        `MyFrameworkUsingAndDefiningCallback`
        '''
        return x + y + z

Naming inconsistencies in existing parameter and their type documentations are still detected.

    *Redefining %r from loop (line %s)* Used when a loop variable is overwritten in the loop body.

## Set Membership checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.set_membership`. Verbatim name of the checker is `set_membership`.

### Set Membership checker Messages

  - use-set-for-membership (R6201)  
    *Consider using set for membership test* Membership tests are more efficient when performed on a lookup optimized datatype like `sets`.

## Typing checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.typing`. Verbatim name of the checker is `typing`.

### Typing checker Documentation

Find issue specifically related to type annotations.

See also \[typing checker's options' documentation \<typing-options\>\](\#typing-checker's-options'-documentation-\<typing-options\>)

### Typing checker Messages

  - broken-noreturn (E6004)  
    *'NoReturn' inside compound types is broken in 3.7.0 / 3.7.1* `typing.NoReturn` inside compound types is broken in Python 3.7.0 and 3.7.1. If not dependent on runtime introspection, use string annotation instead. E.g. `Callable[..., 'NoReturn']`. <https://bugs.python.org/issue34921>

  - broken-collections-callable (E6005)  
    *'collections.abc.Callable' inside Optional and Union is broken in 3.9.0 / 3.9.1 (use 'typing.Callable' instead)* `collections.abc.Callable` inside Optional and Union is broken in Python 3.9.0 and 3.9.1. Use `typing.Callable` for these cases instead. <https://bugs.python.org/issue42965>

  - deprecated-typing-alias (W6001)  
    *'%s' is deprecated, use '%s' instead* Emitted when a deprecated typing alias is used.

  - consider-using-alias (R6002)  
    *'%s' will be deprecated with PY39, consider using '%s' instead%s* Only emitted if 'runtime-typing=no' and a deprecated typing alias is used in a type annotation context in Python 3.7 or 3.8.

  - consider-alternative-union-syntax (R6003)  
    *Consider using alternative union syntax instead of '%s'%s* Emitted when `typing.Union` or `typing.Optional` is used instead of the shorthand union syntax. For example, `Union[int, float]` instead of `int | float`. Using the shorthand for unions aligns with Python typing recommendations, removes the need for imports, and avoids confusion in function signatures.

  - unnecessary-default-type-args (R6007)  
    *Type \`%s\` has unnecessary default type args. Change it to \`%s\`.* Emitted when types have default type args which can be omitted. Mainly used for <span class="title-ref">typing.Generator</span> and <span class="title-ref">typing.AsyncGenerator</span>.

  - redundant-typehint-argument (R6006)  
    *Type \`%s\` is used more than once in union type annotation. Remove redundant typehints.* Duplicated type arguments will be skipped by <span class="title-ref">mypy</span> tool, therefore should be removed to avoid confusion.

## While Used checker

This checker is provided by `pylint.extensions.while_used`. Verbatim name of the checker is `while_used`.

### While Used checker Messages

  - while-used (W0149)  
    *Used \`while\` loop* Unbounded <span class="title-ref">while</span> loops can often be rewritten as bounded <span class="title-ref">for</span> loops. Exceptions can be made for cases such as event loops, listeners, etc.

# Pylint features

## Pylint checkers' options and switches

Pylint checkers can provide three set of features:

  - options that control their execution,
  - messages that they can raise,
  - reports that they can generate.

Below is a list of all checkers and their features.

### Async checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `async`.

#### Async checker Messages

  - not-async-context-manager (E1701)  
    *Async context manager '%s' doesn't implement \_\_aenter\_\_ and \_\_aexit\_\_.* Used when an async context manager is used with an object that does not implement the async context management protocol. This message can't be emitted when using Python \< 3.5.

  - yield-inside-async-function (E1700)  
    *Yield inside async function* Used when an <span class="title-ref">yield</span> or <span class="title-ref">yield from</span> statement is found inside an async function. This message can't be emitted when using Python \< 3.5.

### Bad-Chained-Comparison checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `bad-chained-comparison`.

#### Bad-Chained-Comparison checker Messages

  - bad-chained-comparison (W3601)  
    *Suspicious %s-part chained comparison using semantically incompatible operators (%s)* Used when there is a chained comparison where one expression is part of two comparisons that belong to different semantic groups ("\<" does not mean the same thing as "is", chaining them in "0 \< x is None" is probably a mistake).

### Basic checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `basic`.

See also \[basic checker's options' documentation \<basic-options\>\](\#basic-checker's-options'-documentation-\<basic-options\>)

#### Basic checker Messages

  - not-in-loop (E0103)  
    *%r not properly in loop* Used when break or continue keywords are used outside a loop.

  - function-redefined (E0102)  
    *%s already defined line %s* Used when a function / class / method is redefined.

  - continue-in-finally (E0116)  
    *'continue' not supported inside 'finally' clause* Emitted when the <span class="title-ref">continue</span> keyword is found inside a finally clause, which is a SyntaxError.

  - abstract-class-instantiated (E0110)  
    *Abstract class %r with abstract methods instantiated* Used when an abstract class with <span class="title-ref">abc.ABCMeta</span> as metaclass has abstract methods and is instantiated.

  - star-needs-assignment-target (E0114)  
    *Can use starred expression only in assignment target* Emitted when a star expression is not used in an assignment target.

  - duplicate-argument-name (E0108)  
    *Duplicate argument name %r in function definition* Duplicate argument names in function definitions are syntax errors.

  - return-in-init (E0101)  
    *Explicit return in \_\_init\_\_* Used when the special class method \_\_init\_\_ has an explicit return value.

  - too-many-star-expressions (E0112)  
    *More than one starred expression in assignment* Emitted when there are more than one starred expressions (<span class="title-ref">\*x</span>) in an assignment. This is a SyntaxError.

  - nonlocal-and-global (E0115)  
    *Name %r is nonlocal and global* Emitted when a name is both nonlocal and global.

  - used-prior-global-declaration (E0118)  
    *Name %r is used prior to global declaration* Emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration, which results in an error since Python 3.6. This message can't be emitted when using Python \< 3.6.

  - return-outside-function (E0104)  
    *Return outside function* Used when a "return" statement is found outside a function or method.

  - return-arg-in-generator (E0106)  
    *Return with argument inside generator* Used when a "return" statement with an argument is found in a generator function or method (e.g. with some "yield" statements). This message can't be emitted when using Python \>= 3.3.

  - invalid-star-assignment-target (E0113)  
    *Starred assignment target must be in a list or tuple* Emitted when a star expression is used as a starred assignment target.

  - bad-reversed-sequence (E0111)  
    *The first reversed() argument is not a sequence* Used when the first argument to reversed() builtin isn't a sequence (does not implement \_\_reversed\_\_, nor \_\_getitem\_\_ and \_\_len\_\_

  - nonexistent-operator (E0107)  
    *Use of the non-existent %s operator* Used when you attempt to use the C-style pre-increment or pre-decrement operator -- and ++, which doesn't exist in Python.

  - yield-outside-function (E0105)  
    *Yield outside function* Used when a "yield" statement is found outside a function or method.

  - init-is-generator (E0100)  
    *\_\_init\_\_ method is a generator* Used when the special class method \_\_init\_\_ is turned into a generator by a yield in its body.

  - misplaced-format-function (E0119)  
    *format function is not called on str* Emitted when format function is not called on str object. e.g doing print("value: {}").format(123) instead of print("value: {}".format(123)). This might not be what the user intended to do.

  - nonlocal-without-binding (E0117)  
    *nonlocal name %s found without binding* Emitted when a nonlocal variable does not have an attached name somewhere in the parent scopes

  - lost-exception (W0150)  
    *%s statement in finally block may swallow exception* Used when a break or a return statement is found inside the finally clause of a try...finally block: the exceptions raised in the try clause will be silently swallowed instead of being re-raised.

  - return-in-finally (W0134)  
    *'return' shadowed by the 'finally' clause.* Emitted when a 'return' statement is found in a 'finally' block. This will overwrite the return value of a function and should be avoided.

  - assert-on-tuple (W0199)  
    *Assert called on a populated tuple. Did you mean 'assert x,y'?* A call of assert on a tuple will always evaluate to true if the tuple is not empty, and will always evaluate to false if it is.

  - assert-on-string-literal (W0129)  
    *Assert statement has a string literal as its first argument. The assert will %s fail.* Used when an assert statement has a string literal as its first argument, which will cause the assert to always pass.

  - self-assigning-variable (W0127)  
    *Assigning the same variable %r to itself* Emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned to itself

  - comparison-with-callable (W0143)  
    *Comparing against a callable, did you omit the parenthesis?* This message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting in potential unwanted behaviour.

  - nan-comparison (W0177)  
    *Comparison %s should be %s* Used when an expression is compared to NaN values like numpy.NaN and float('nan').

  - dangerous-default-value (W0102)  
    *Dangerous default value %s as argument* Used when a mutable value as list or dictionary is detected in a default value for an argument.

  - duplicate-key (W0109)  
    *Duplicate key %r in dictionary* Used when a dictionary expression binds the same key multiple times.

  - duplicate-value (W0130)  
    *Duplicate value %r in set* This message is emitted when a set contains the same value two or more times.

  - useless-else-on-loop (W0120)  
    *Else clause on loop without a break statement, remove the else and de-indent all the code inside it* Loops should only have an else clause if they can exit early with a break statement, otherwise the statements under else should be on the same scope as the loop itself.

  - pointless-exception-statement (W0133)  
    *Exception statement has no effect* Used when an exception is created without being assigned, raised or returned for subsequent use elsewhere.

  - expression-not-assigned (W0106)  
    *Expression "%s" is assigned to nothing* Used when an expression that is not a function call is assigned to nothing. Probably something else was intended.

  - confusing-with-statement (W0124)  
    *Following "as" with another context manager looks like a tuple.* Emitted when a <span class="title-ref">with</span> statement component returns multiple values and uses name binding with <span class="title-ref">as</span> only for a part of those values, as in with ctx() as a, b. This can be misleading, since it's not clear if the context manager returns a tuple or if the node without a name binding is another context manager.

  - unnecessary-lambda (W0108)  
    *Lambda may not be necessary* Used when the body of a lambda expression is a function call on the same argument list as the lambda itself; such lambda expressions are in all but a few cases replaceable with the function being called in the body of the lambda.

  - named-expr-without-context (W0131)  
    *Named expression used without context* Emitted if named expression is used to do a regular assignment outside a context like if, for, while, or a comprehension.

  - redeclared-assigned-name (W0128)  
    *Redeclared variable %r in assignment* Emitted when we detect that a variable was redeclared in the same assignment.

  - pointless-statement (W0104)  
    *Statement seems to have no effect* Used when a statement doesn't have (or at least seems to) any effect.

  - pointless-string-statement (W0105)  
    *String statement has no effect* Used when a string is used as a statement (which of course has no effect). This is a particular case of W0104 with its own message so you can easily disable it if you're using those strings as documentation, instead of comments.

  - contextmanager-generator-missing-cleanup (W0135)  
    *The context used in function %r will not be exited.* Used when a contextmanager is used inside a generator function and the cleanup is not handled.

  - unnecessary-pass (W0107)  
    *Unnecessary pass statement* Used when a "pass" statement can be removed without affecting the behaviour of the code.

  - unreachable (W0101)  
    *Unreachable code* Used when there is some code behind a "return" or "raise" statement, which will never be accessed.

  - eval-used (W0123)  
    *Use of eval* Used when you use the "eval" function, to discourage its usage. Consider using <span class="title-ref">ast.literal\_eval</span> for safely evaluating strings containing Python expressions from untrusted sources.

  - exec-used (W0122)  
    *Use of exec* Raised when the 'exec' statement is used. It's dangerous to use this function for a user input, and it's also slower than actual code in general. This doesn't mean you should never use it, but you should consider alternatives first and restrict the functions available.

  - using-constant-test (W0125)  
    *Using a conditional statement with a constant value* Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) uses a constant value for its test. This might not be what the user intended to do.

  - missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test (W0126)  
    *Using a conditional statement with potentially wrong function or method call due to missing parentheses* Emitted when a conditional statement (If or ternary if) seems to wrongly call a function due to missing parentheses

  - comparison-of-constants (R0133)  
    *Comparison between constants: '%s %s %s' has a constant value* When two literals are compared with each other the result is a constant. Using the constant directly is both easier to read and more performant. Initializing 'True' and 'False' this way is not required since Python 2.3.

  - literal-comparison (R0123)  
    *In '%s', use '%s' when comparing constant literals not '%s' ('%s')* Used when comparing an object to a literal, which is usually what you do not want to do, since you can compare to a different literal than what was expected altogether.

  - comparison-with-itself (R0124)  
    *Redundant comparison - %s* Used when something is compared against itself.

  - invalid-name (C0103)  
    *%s name "%s" doesn't conform to %s* Used when the name doesn't conform to naming rules associated to its type (constant, variable, class...).

  - singleton-comparison (C0121)  
    *Comparison %s should be %s* Used when an expression is compared to singleton values like True, False or None.

  - empty-docstring (C0112)  
    *Empty %s docstring* Used when a module, function, class or method has an empty docstring (it would be too easy ;).

  - missing-class-docstring (C0115)  
    *Missing class docstring* Used when a class has no docstring. Even an empty class must have a docstring.

  - missing-function-docstring (C0116)

    *Missing module docstring* Used when a module has no docstring. Empty modules do not require a docstring.

  - typevar-name-incorrect-variance (C0105)  
    *Type variable name does not reflect variance%s* Emitted when a TypeVar name doesn't reflect its type variance. According to PEP8, it is recommended to add suffixes '\_co' and '\_contra' to the variables used to declare covariant or contravariant behaviour respectively. Invariant (default) variables do not require a suffix. The message is also emitted when invariant variables do have a suffix.

  - typevar-double-variance (C0131)  
    *TypeVar cannot be both covariant and contravariant* Emitted when both the "covariant" and "contravariant" keyword arguments are set to "True" in a TypeVar.

  - typevar-name-mismatch (C0132)  
    *TypeVar name "%s" does not match assigned variable name "%s"* Emitted when a TypeVar is assigned to a variable that does not match its name argument.

  - unidiomatic-typecheck (C0123)  
    *Use isinstance() rather than type() for a typecheck.* The idiomatic way to perform an explicit typecheck in Python is to use isinstance(x, Y) rather than type(x) == Y, type(x) is Y. Though there are unusual situations where these give different results.

### Exceptions checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `exceptions`.

See also \[exceptions checker's options' documentation \<exceptions-options\>\](\#exceptions-checker's-options'-documentation-\<exceptions-options\>)

#### Exceptions checker Messages

  - bad-except-order (E0701)  
    *Bad except clauses order (%s)* Used when except clauses are not in the correct order (from the more specific to the more generic). If you don't fix the order, some exceptions may not be caught by the most specific handler.

  - catching-non-exception (E0712)  
    *Catching an exception which doesn't inherit from Exception: %s* Used when a class which doesn't inherit from Exception is used as an exception in an except clause.

  - bad-exception-cause (E0705)  
    *Exception cause set to something which is not an exception, nor None* Used when using the syntax "raise ... from ...", where the exception cause is not an exception, nor None.

  - notimplemented-raised (E0711)  
    *NotImplemented raised - should raise NotImplementedError* Used when NotImplemented is raised instead of NotImplementedError

  - raising-bad-type (E0702)  
    *Raising %s while only classes or instances are allowed* Used when something which is neither a class nor an instance is raised (i.e. a <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> will be raised).

  - raising-non-exception (E0710)  
    *Raising a class which doesn't inherit from BaseException* Used when a class which doesn't inherit from BaseException is raised.

  - misplaced-bare-raise (E0704)  
    *The raise statement is not inside an except clause* Used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause. This generates an error, since there are no active exceptions to be reraised. An exception to this rule is represented by a bare raise inside a finally clause, which might work, as long as an exception is raised inside the try block, but it is nevertheless a code smell that must not be relied upon.

  - duplicate-except (W0705)  
    *Catching previously caught exception type %s* Used when an except catches a type that was already caught by a previous handler.

  - broad-exception-caught (W0718)  
    *Catching too general exception %s* If you use a naked `except Exception:` clause, you might end up catching exceptions other than the ones you expect to catch. This can hide bugs or make it harder to debug programs when unrelated errors are hidden.

  - raise-missing-from (W0707)  
    *Consider explicitly re-raising using %s'%s from %s'* Python's exception chaining shows the traceback of the current exception, but also of the original exception. When you raise a new exception after another exception was caught it's likely that the second exception is a friendly re-wrapping of the first exception. In such cases <span class="title-ref">raise from</span> provides a better link between the two tracebacks in the final error.

  - raising-format-tuple (W0715)  
    *Exception arguments suggest string formatting might be intended* Used when passing multiple arguments to an exception constructor, the first of them a string literal containing what appears to be placeholders intended for formatting

  - binary-op-exception (W0711)  
    *Exception to catch is the result of a binary "%s" operation* Used when the exception to catch is of the form "except A or B:". If intending to catch multiple, rewrite as "except (A, B):"

  - wrong-exception-operation (W0716)  
    *Invalid exception operation. %s* Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary operations between exceptions in except handlers.

  - bare-except (W0702)  
    *No exception type(s) specified* A bare `except:` clause will catch `SystemExit` and `KeyboardInterrupt` exceptions, making it harder to interrupt a program with `Control-C`, and can disguise other problems. If you want to catch all exceptions that signal program errors, use `except Exception:` (bare except is equivalent to `except BaseException:`).

  - broad-exception-raised (W0719)  
    *Raising too general exception: %s* Raising exceptions that are too generic force you to catch exceptions generically too. It will force you to use a naked `except Exception:` clause. You might then end up catching exceptions other than the ones you expect to catch. This can hide bugs or make it harder to debug programs when unrelated errors are hidden.

  - try-except-raise (W0706)  
    *The except handler raises immediately* Used when an except handler uses raise as its first or only operator. This is useless because it raises back the exception immediately. Remove the raise operator or the entire try-except-raise block\!

  - wrong-import-order (C0411)  
    *%s should be placed before %s* Used when PEP8 import order is not respected (standard imports first, then third-party libraries, then local imports).

  - wrong-import-position (C0413)  
    *Import "%s" should be placed at the top of the module* Used when code and imports are mixed.

  - useless-import-alias (C0414)  
    *Import alias does not rename original package* Used when an import alias is same as original package, e.g., using import numpy as numpy instead of import numpy as np.

  - import-outside-toplevel (C0415)

  - logging-not-lazy (W1201)  
    *Use %s formatting in logging functions* Used when a logging statement has a call form of "logging.\<logging method\>(format\_string % (format\_args...))". Use another type of string formatting instead. You can use % formatting but leave interpolation to the logging function by passing the parameters as arguments. If logging-fstring-interpolation is disabled then you can use fstring formatting. If logging-format-interpolation is disabled then you can use str.format.

### Method Args checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `method_args`.

See also \[method\_args checker's options' documentation \<method\_args-options\>\](\#method\_args-checker's-options'-documentation-\<method\_args-options\>)

#### Method Args checker Messages

  - positional-only-arguments-expected (E3102)  
    *\`%s()\` got some positional-only arguments passed as keyword arguments: %s* Emitted when positional-only arguments have been passed as keyword arguments. Remove the keywords for the affected arguments in the function call.

  - missing-timeout (W3101)  
    *Missing timeout argument for method '%s' can cause your program to hang indefinitely* Used when a method needs a 'timeout' parameter in order to avoid waiting for a long time. If no timeout is specified explicitly the default value is used. For example for 'requests' the program will never time out (i.e. hang indefinitely).

### Metrics checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `metrics`.

#### Metrics checker Reports

  - RP0701  
    Raw metrics

### Miscellaneous checker

#### Miscellaneous checker Messages

  - fixme (W0511)  
    Used when a warning note as FIXME or XXX is detected.

  - use-symbolic-message-instead (I0023)  
    Used when a message is enabled or disabled by id.

### Modified Iteration checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `modified_iteration`.

#### Modified Iteration checker Messages

  - modified-iterating-dict (E4702)  
    *Iterated dict '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, iterate through a copy of it instead.* Emitted when items are added or removed to a dict being iterated through. Doing so raises a RuntimeError.

  - modified-iterating-set (E4703)  
    *Iterated set '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, iterate through a copy of it instead.* Emitted when items are added or removed to a set being iterated through. Doing so raises a RuntimeError.

  - modified-iterating-list (W4701)  
    *Iterated list '%s' is being modified inside for loop body, consider iterating through a copy of it instead.* Emitted when items are added or removed to a list being iterated through. Doing so can result in unexpected behaviour, that is why it is preferred to use a copy of the list.

### Nested Min Max checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `nested_min_max`.

#### Nested Min Max checker Messages

  - nested-min-max (W3301)  
    *Do not use nested call of '%s'; it's possible to do '%s' instead* Nested calls `min(1, min(2, 3))` can be rewritten as `min(1, 2, 3)`.

### Newstyle checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `newstyle`.

#### Newstyle checker Messages

  - bad-super-call (E1003)  
    *Bad first argument %r given to super()* Used when another argument than the current class is given as first argument of the super builtin.

### Nonascii-Checker checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `nonascii-checker`.

#### Nonascii-Checker checker Messages

  - non-ascii-file-name (W2402)  
    *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character.* Under python 3.5, PEP 3131 allows non-ascii identifiers, but not non-ascii file names.Since Python 3.5, even though Python supports UTF-8 files, some editors or tools don't.

  - non-ascii-name (C2401)  
    *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character, consider renaming it.* Used when the name contains at least one non-ASCII unicode character. See <https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusing-features> for a background why this could be bad. If your programming guideline defines that you are programming in English, then there should be no need for non ASCII characters in Python Names. If not you can simply disable this check.

  - non-ascii-module-import (C2403)  
    *%s name "%s" contains a non-ASCII character, use an ASCII-only alias for import.* Used when the name contains at least one non-ASCII unicode character. See <https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusing-features> for a background why this could be bad. If your programming guideline defines that you are programming in English, then there should be no need for non ASCII characters in Python Names. If not you can simply disable this check.

### Refactoring checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `refactoring`.

See also \[refactoring checker's options' documentation \<refactoring-options\>\](\#refactoring-checker's-options'-documentation-\<refactoring-options\>)

#### Refactoring checker Messages

  - simplifiable-condition (R1726)  
    *Boolean condition "%s" may be simplified to "%s"* Emitted when a boolean condition is able to be simplified.

  - condition-evals-to-constant (R1727)  
    *Boolean condition '%s' will always evaluate to '%s'* Emitted when a boolean condition can be simplified to a constant value.

  - simplify-boolean-expression (R1709)  
    *Boolean expression may be simplified to %s* Emitted when redundant pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.

  - consider-using-in (R1714)  
    *Consider merging these comparisons with 'in' by using '%s %sin (%s)'. Use a set instead if elements are hashable.* To check if a variable is equal to one of many values, combine the values into a set or tuple and check if the variable is contained "in" it instead of checking for equality against each of the values. This is faster and less verbose.

  - consider-merging-isinstance (R1701)  
    *Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(%s, (%s))* Used when multiple consecutive isinstance calls can be merged into one.

  - use-dict-literal (R1735)  
    *Consider using '%s' instead of a call to 'dict'.* Emitted when using dict() to create a dictionary instead of a literal '{ ... }'. The literal is faster as it avoids an additional function call.

  - consider-using-max-builtin (R1731)  
    *Consider using '%s' instead of unnecessary if block* Using the max builtin instead of a conditional improves readability and conciseness.

  - consider-using-min-builtin (R1730)  
    *Consider using '%s' instead of unnecessary if block* Using the min builtin instead of a conditional improves readability and conciseness.

  - consider-using-sys-exit (R1722)  
    *Consider using 'sys.exit' instead* Contrary to 'exit()' or 'quit()', 'sys.exit' does not rely on the site module being available (as the 'sys' module is always available).

  - consider-using-with (R1732)  
    *Consider using 'with' for resource-allocating operations* Emitted if a resource-allocating assignment or call may be replaced by a 'with' block. By using 'with' the release of the allocated resources is ensured even in the case of an exception.

  - super-with-arguments (R1725)  
    *Consider using Python 3 style super() without arguments* Emitted when calling the super() builtin with the current class and instance. On Python 3 these arguments are the default and they can be omitted.

  - use-list-literal (R1734)  
    *Consider using \[\] instead of list()* Emitted when using list() to create an empty list instead of the literal \[\]. The literal is faster as it avoids an additional function call.

  - consider-using-dict-comprehension (R1717)  
    *Consider using a dictionary comprehension* Emitted when we detect the creation of a dictionary using the dict() callable and a transient list. Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a dict comprehension. Also it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list

  - consider-using-generator (R1728)  
    *Consider using a generator instead '%s(%s)'* If your container can be large using a generator will bring better performance.

  - consider-using-set-comprehension (R1718)  
    *Consider using a set comprehension* Although there is nothing syntactically wrong with this code, it is hard to read and can be simplified to a set comprehension. Also it is faster since you don't need to create another transient list

  - consider-using-get (R1715)  
    *Consider using dict.get for getting values from a dict if a key is present or a default if not* Using the builtin dict.get for getting a value from a dictionary if a key is present or a default if not, is simpler and considered more idiomatic, although sometimes a bit slower

  - consider-using-join (R1713)  
    *Consider using str.join(sequence) for concatenating strings from an iterable* Using str.join(sequence) is faster, uses less memory and increases readability compared to for-loop iteration.

  - consider-using-ternary (R1706)  
    *Consider using ternary (%s)* Used when one of known pre-python 2.5 ternary syntax is used.

  - consider-swap-variables (R1712)  
    *Consider using tuple unpacking for swapping variables* You do not have to use a temporary variable in order to swap variables. Using "tuple unpacking" to directly swap variables makes the intention more clear.

  - trailing-comma-tuple (R1707)  
    *Disallow trailing comma tuple* In Python, a tuple is actually created by the comma symbol, not by the parentheses. Unfortunately, one can actually create a tuple by misplacing a trailing comma, which can lead to potential weird bugs in your code. You should always use parentheses explicitly for creating a tuple.

  - stop-iteration-return (R1708)  
    *Do not raise StopIteration in generator, use return statement instead* According to PEP479, the raise of StopIteration to end the loop of a generator may lead to hard to find bugs. This PEP specify that raise StopIteration has to be replaced by a simple return statement

  - inconsistent-return-statements (R1710)  
    *Either all return statements in a function should return an expression, or none of them should.* According to PEP8, if any return statement returns an expression, any return statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the function (if reachable)

  - redefined-argument-from-local (R1704)  
    *Redefining argument with the local name %r* Used when a local name is redefining an argument, which might suggest a potential error. This is taken in account only for a handful of name binding operations, such as for iteration, with statement assignment and exception handler assignment.

  - chained-comparison (R1716)  
    *Simplify chained comparison between the operands* This message is emitted when pylint encounters boolean operation like "a \< b and b \< c", suggesting instead to refactor it to "a \< b \< c"

  - simplifiable-if-expression (R1719)  
    *The if expression can be replaced with %s* Used when an if expression can be replaced with 'bool(test)' or simply 'test' if the boolean cast is implicit.

  - simplifiable-if-statement (R1703)  
    *The if statement can be replaced with %s* Used when an if statement can be replaced with 'bool(test)'.

  - too-many-nested-blocks (R1702)  
    *Too many nested blocks (%s/%s)* Used when a function or a method has too many nested blocks. This makes the code less understandable and maintainable.

  - no-else-break (R1723)  
    *Unnecessary "%s" after "break", %s* Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if containing a break statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a break statement.

  - no-else-continue (R1724)  
    *Unnecessary "%s" after "continue", %s* Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if containing a continue statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a continue statement.

  - no-else-raise (R1720)  
    *Unnecessary "%s" after "raise", %s* Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if, or a try/except containing a raise statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a raise statement.

  - no-else-return (R1705)  
    *Unnecessary "%s" after "return", %s* Used in order to highlight an unnecessary block of code following an if, or a try/except containing a return statement. As such, it will warn when it encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.

  - unnecessary-dict-index-lookup (R1733)  
    *Unnecessary dictionary index lookup, use '%s' instead* Emitted when iterating over the dictionary items (key-item pairs) and accessing the value by index lookup. The value can be accessed directly instead.

  - unnecessary-list-index-lookup (R1736)  
    *Unnecessary list index lookup, use '%s' instead* Emitted when iterating over an enumeration and accessing the value by index lookup. The value can be accessed directly instead.

  - unnecessary-comprehension (R1721)  
    *Unnecessary use of a comprehension, use %s instead.* Instead of using an identity comprehension, consider using the list, dict or set constructor. It is faster and simpler.

  - use-yield-from (R1737)  
    *Use 'yield from' directly instead of yielding each element one by one* Yielding directly from the iterator is faster and arguably cleaner code than yielding each element one by one in the loop.

  - use-a-generator (R1729)  
    *Use a generator instead '%s(%s)'* Comprehension inside of 'any', 'all', 'max', 'min' or 'sum' is unnecessary. A generator would be sufficient and faster.

  - useless-return (R1711)  
    *Useless return at end of function or method* Emitted when a single "return" or "return None" statement is found at the end of function or method definition. This statement can safely be removed because Python will implicitly return None

  - use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison (C1803)  
    *"%s" can be simplified to "%s", if it is strictly a sequence, as an empty %s is falsey* Empty sequences are considered false in a boolean context. Following this check blindly in weakly typed code base can create hard to debug issues. If the value can be something else that is falsey but not a sequence (for example `None`, an empty string, or `0`) the code will not be equivalent.

  - use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string (C1804)  
    *"%s" can be simplified to "%s", if it is strictly a string, as an empty string is falsey* Empty string are considered false in a boolean context. Following this check blindly in weakly typed code base can create hard to debug issues. If the value can be something else that is falsey but not a string (for example `None`, an empty sequence, or `0`) the code will not be equivalent.

  - use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-zero (C1805)  
    *"%s" can be simplified to "%s", if it is strictly an int, as 0 is falsey* 0 is considered false in a boolean context. Following this check blindly in weakly typed code base can create hard to debug issues. If the value can be something else that is falsey but not an int (for example `None`, an empty string, or an empty sequence) the code will not be equivalent.

  - unnecessary-negation (C0117)  
    *Consider changing "%s" to "%s"* Used when a boolean expression contains an unneeded negation, e.g. when two negation operators cancel each other out.

  - consider-iterating-dictionary (C0201)  
    *Consider iterating the dictionary directly instead of calling .keys()* Emitted when the keys of a dictionary are iterated through the `.keys()` method or when `.keys()` is used for a membership check. It is enough to iterate through the dictionary itself, `for key in dictionary`. For membership checks, `if key in dictionary` is faster.

  - consider-using-dict-items (C0206)  
    *Consider iterating with .items()* Emitted when iterating over the keys of a dictionary and accessing the value by index lookup. Both the key and value can be accessed by iterating using the .items() method of the dictionary instead.

  - consider-using-enumerate (C0200)  
    *Consider using enumerate instead of iterating with range and len* Emitted when code that iterates with range and len is encountered. Such code can be simplified by using the enumerate builtin.

  - use-implicit-booleaness-not-len (C1802)  
    *Do not use \`len(SEQUENCE)\` without comparison to determine if a sequence is empty* Empty sequences are considered false in a boolean context. You can either remove the call to 'len' (`if not x`) or compare the length against a scalar (`if len(x) > 1`).

  - consider-using-f-string (C0209)  
    *Formatting a regular string which could be an f-string* Used when we detect a string that is being formatted with format() or % which could potentially be an f-string. The use of f-strings is preferred. Requires Python 3.6 and `py-version >= 3.6`.

  - use-maxsplit-arg (C0207)  
    *Use %s instead* Emitted when accessing only the first or last element of str.split(). The first and last element can be accessed by using str.split(sep, maxsplit=1)\[0\] or str.rsplit(sep, maxsplit=1)\[-1\] instead.

  - use-sequence-for-iteration (C0208)  
    *Use a sequence type when iterating over values* When iterating over values, sequence types (e.g., `lists`, `tuples`, `ranges`) are more efficient than `sets`.

### Similarities checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `similarities`.

See also \[similarities checker's options' documentation \<similarities-options\>\](\#similarities-checker's-options'-documentation-\<similarities-options\>)

#### Similarities checker Messages

    *Similar lines in %s files* Indicates that a set of similar lines has been detected among multiple file. This usually means that the code should be refactored to avoid this duplication.

#### Similarities checker Reports

  - RP0801  
    Duplication

### Spelling checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `spelling`.

See also \[spelling checker's options' documentation \<spelling-options\>\](\#spelling-checker's-options'-documentation-\<spelling-options\>)

#### Spelling checker Messages

  - invalid-characters-in-docstring (C0403)  
    *Invalid characters %r in a docstring* Used when a word in docstring cannot be checked by enchant.

  - wrong-spelling-in-comment (C0401)  
    *Wrong spelling of a word '%s' in a comment:* Used when a word in comment is not spelled correctly.

  - wrong-spelling-in-docstring (C0402)  
    *Wrong spelling of a word '%s' in a docstring:* Used when a word in docstring is not spelled correctly.

### Stdlib checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `stdlib`.

#### Stdlib checker Messages

  - invalid-envvar-value (E1507)  
    *%s does not support %s type argument* Env manipulation functions support only string type arguments. See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv>.

  - singledispatch-method (E1519)  
    *singledispatch decorator should not be used with methods, use singledispatchmethod instead.* singledispatch should decorate functions and not class/instance methods. Use singledispatchmethod for those cases.

  - singledispatchmethod-function (E1520)  
    *singledispatchmethod decorator should not be used with functions, use singledispatch instead.* singledispatchmethod should decorate class/instance methods and not functions. Use singledispatch for those cases.

  - bad-open-mode (W1501)  
    *"%s" is not a valid mode for open.* Python supports: r, w, a\[, x\] modes with b, +, and U (only with r) options. See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open>

  - invalid-envvar-default (W1508)  
    *%s default type is %s. Expected str or None.* Env manipulation functions return None or str values. Supplying anything different as a default may cause bugs. See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/os.html#os.getenv>.

  - method-cache-max-size-none (W1518)  
    *'lru\_cache(maxsize=None)' or 'cache' will keep all method args alive indefinitely, including 'self'* By decorating a method with lru\_cache or cache the 'self' argument will be linked to the function and therefore never garbage collected. Unless your instance will never need to be garbage collected (singleton) it is recommended to refactor code to avoid this pattern or add a maxsize to the cache. The default value for maxsize is 128.

  - subprocess-run-check (W1510)  
    *'subprocess.run' used without explicitly defining the value for 'check'.* The `check` keyword is set to False by default. It means the process launched by `subprocess.run` can exit with a non-zero exit code and fail silently. It's better to set it explicitly to make clear what the error-handling behavior is.

  - forgotten-debug-statement (W1515)  
    *Leaving functions creating breakpoints in production code is not recommended* Calls to breakpoint(), sys.breakpointhook() and pdb.set\_trace() should be removed from code that is not actively being debugged.

  - redundant-unittest-assert (W1503)  
    *Redundant use of %s with constant value %r* The first argument of assertTrue and assertFalse is a condition. If a constant is passed as parameter, that condition will be always true. In this case a warning should be emitted.

  - shallow-copy-environ (W1507)  
    *Using copy.copy(os.environ). Use os.environ.copy() instead.* os.environ is not a dict object but proxy object, so shallow copy has still effects on original object. See <https://bugs.python.org/issue15373> for reference.

  - boolean-datetime (W1502)  
    *Using datetime.time in a boolean context.* Using datetime.time in a boolean context can hide subtle bugs when the time they represent matches midnight UTC. This behaviour was fixed in Python 3.5. See <https://bugs.python.org/issue13936> for reference. This message can't be emitted when using Python \>= 3.5.

  - deprecated-argument (W4903)  
    *Using deprecated argument %s of method %s()* The argument is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  - deprecated-attribute (W4906)  
    *Using deprecated attribute %r* The attribute is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  - deprecated-class (W4904)  
    *Using deprecated class %s of module %s* The class is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  - deprecated-decorator (W4905)  
    *Using deprecated decorator %s()* The decorator is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  - deprecated-method (W4902)  
    *Using deprecated method %s()* The method is marked as deprecated and will be removed in the future.

  - unspecified-encoding (W1514)  
    *Using open without explicitly specifying an encoding* It is better to specify an encoding when opening documents. Using the system default implicitly can create problems on other operating systems. See <https://peps.python.org/pep-0597/>

  - subprocess-popen-preexec-fn (W1509)  
    *Using preexec\_fn keyword which may be unsafe in the presence of threads* The preexec\_fn parameter is not safe to use in the presence of threads in your application. The child process could deadlock before exec is called. If you must use it, keep it trivial\! Minimize the number of libraries you call into. See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor>

  - bad-thread-instantiation (W1506)  
    *threading.Thread needs the target function* The warning is emitted when a threading.Thread class is instantiated without the target function being passed as a kwarg or as a second argument. By default, the first parameter is the group param, not the target param.

### String checker

Verbatim name of the checker is `string`.

See also \[string checker's options' documentation \<string-options\>\](\#string-checker's-options'-documentation-\<string-options\>)

#### String checker Messages

    *Argument %r does not match format type %r* Used when a type required by format string is not suitable for actual argument type

  - format-needs-mapping (E1303)  
    *Expected mapping for format string, not %s* Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with an argument that is not a mapping.

    *Format string ends in middle of conversion specifier* Used when a format string terminates before the end of a conversion specifier.

  - missing-format-string-key (E1304)  
    *Missing key %r in format string dictionary* Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with a dictionary that doesn't contain all the keys required by the format string.

  - mixed-format-string (E1302)  
    *Mixing named and unnamed conversion specifiers in format string* Used when a format string contains both named (e.g. '%(foo)d') and unnamed (e.g. '%d') conversion specifiers. This is also used when a named conversion specifier contains \* for the minimum field width and/or precision.

  - too-few-format-args (E1306)  
    *Not enough arguments for format string* Used when a format string that uses unnamed conversion specifiers is given too few arguments

  - bad-str-strip-call (E1310)  
    *Suspicious argument in %s.%s call* The argument to a str.{l,r,}strip call contains a duplicate character,

  - too-many-format-args (E1305)  
    *Too many arguments for format string* Used when a format string that uses unnamed conversion specifiers is given too many arguments.

  - bad-format-character (E1300)  
    *Unsupported format character %r (%\#02x) at index %d* Used when an unsupported format character is used in a format string.

  - anomalous-unicode-escape-in-string (W1402)  
    *Anomalous Unicode escape in byte string: '%s'. String constant might be missing an r or u prefix.* Used when an escape like u is encountered in a byte string where it has no effect.

  - anomalous-backslash-in-string (W1401)

  - duplicate-string-formatting-argument (W1308)  
    *Duplicate string formatting argument %r, consider passing as named argument* Used when we detect that a string formatting is repeating an argument instead of using named string arguments

  - format-combined-specification (W1305)  
    *Format string contains both automatic field numbering and manual field specification* Used when a PEP 3101 format string contains both automatic field numbering (e.g. '{}') and manual field specification (e.g. '{0}').

  - bad-format-string-key (W1300)  
    *Format string dictionary key should be a string, not %s* Used when a format string that uses named conversion specifiers is used with a dictionary whose keys are not all strings.

  - implicit-str-concat (W1404)  
    *Implicit string concatenation found in %s* String literals are implicitly concatenated in a literal iterable definition : maybe a comma is missing ?

    *Invalid format string* Used when a PEP 3101 format string is invalid.

  - missing-format-attribute (W1306)  
    *Missing format attribute %r in format specifier %r* Used when a PEP 3101 format string uses an attribute specifier ({0.length}), but the argument passed for formatting doesn't have that attribute.

  - missing-format-argument-key (W1303)  
    *Missing keyword argument %r for format string* Used when a PEP 3101 format string that uses named fields doesn't receive one or more required keywords.

  - inconsistent-quotes (W1405)  
    *Quote delimiter %s is inconsistent with the rest of the file* Quote delimiters are not used consistently throughout a module (with allowances made for avoiding unnecessary escaping).

  - redundant-u-string-prefix (W1406)  
    *The u prefix for strings is no longer necessary in Python \>=3.0* Used when we detect a string with a u prefix. These prefixes were necessary in Python 2 to indicate a string was Unicode, but since Python 3.0 strings are Unicode by default.

  - unused-format-string-argument (W1304)  
    *Unused format argument %r* Used when a PEP 3101 format string that uses named fields is used with an argument that is not required by the format string.

  - unused-format-string-key (W1301)

    *Contains control characters that can permit obfuscated code executed differently than displayed* bidirectional unicode are typically not displayed characters required to display right-to-left (RTL) script (i.e. Chinese, Japanese, Arabic, Hebrew, ...) correctly. So can you trust this code? Are you sure it displayed correctly in all editors? If you did not write it or your language is not RTL, remove the special characters, as they could be used to trick you into executing code, that does something else than what it looks like. More Information: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_text> <https://trojansource.codes/>

  - invalid-character-zero-width-space (E2515)  
    *Invalid unescaped character zero-width-space, use "u200B" instead.* Invisible space character could hide real code execution.

  - invalid-unicode-codec (E2501)

# Standard Checkers

## `Main` **Checker**

### \--analyse-fallback-blocks

*Analyse import fallback blocks. This can be used to support both Python 2 and 3 compatible code, which means that the block might have code that exists only in one or another interpreter, leading to false positives when analysed.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--clear-cache-post-run

*Clear in-memory caches upon conclusion of linting. Useful if running pylint in a server-like mode.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--confidence

*Only show warnings with the listed confidence levels. Leave empty to show all. Valid levels: HIGH, CONTROL\_FLOW, INFERENCE, INFERENCE\_FAILURE, UNDEFINED.*

**Default:** `['HIGH', 'CONTROL_FLOW', 'INFERENCE', 'INFERENCE_FAILURE', 'UNDEFINED']`

### \--disable

*Disable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can either give multiple identifiers separated by comma (,) or put this option multiple times (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where it should appear only once). You can also use "--disable=all" to disable everything first and then re-enable specific checks. For example, if you want to run only the similarities checker, you can use "--disable=all --enable=similarities". If you want to run only the classes checker, but have no Warning level messages displayed, use "--disable=all --enable=classes --disable=W".*

**Default:** `()`

### \--enable

*Enable the message, report, category or checker with the given id(s). You can either give multiple identifier separated by comma (,) or put this option multiple time (only on the command line, not in the configuration file where it should appear only once). See also the "--disable" option for examples.*

**Default:** `()`

### \--evaluation

*Python expression which should return a score less than or equal to 10. You have access to the variables 'fatal', 'error', 'warning', 'refactor', 'convention', and 'info' which contain the number of messages in each category, as well as 'statement' which is the total number of statements analyzed. This score is used by the global evaluation report (RP0004).*

**Default:** `max(0, 0 if fatal else 10.0 - ((float(5 * error + warning + refactor + convention) / statement) * 10))`

### \--exit-zero

*Always return a 0 (non-error) status code, even if lint errors are found. This is primarily useful in continuous integration scripts.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--extension-pkg-allow-list

*A comma-separated list of package or module names from where C extensions may be loaded. Extensions are loading into the active Python interpreter and may run arbitrary code.*

**Default:** `[]`

### \--extension-pkg-whitelist

*A comma-separated list of package or module names from where C extensions may be loaded. Extensions are loading into the active Python interpreter and may run arbitrary code. (This is an alternative name to extension-pkg-allow-list for backward compatibility.)*

**Default:** `[]`

### \--fail-on

*Return non-zero exit code if any of these messages/categories are detected, even if score is above --fail-under value. Syntax same as enable. Messages specified are enabled, while categories only check already-enabled messages.*

**Default:** `""`

### \--fail-under

*Specify a score threshold under which the program will exit with error.*

**Default:** `10`

### \--from-stdin

*Interpret the stdin as a python script, whose filename needs to be passed as the module\_or\_package argument.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--ignore

*Files or directories to be skipped. They should be base names, not paths.*

**Default:** `('CVS',)`

### \--ignore-paths

*Add files or directories matching the regular expressions patterns to the ignore-list. The regex matches against paths and can be in Posix or Windows format. Because '\\' represents the directory delimiter on Windows systems, it can't be used as an escape character.*

**Default:** `[]`

### \--ignore-patterns

*Files or directories matching the regular expression patterns are skipped. The regex matches against base names, not paths. The default value ignores Emacs file locks*

**Default:** `(re.compile('^\\.#'),)`

### \--ignored-modules

*List of module names for which member attributes should not be checked and will not be imported (useful for modules/projects where namespaces are manipulated during runtime and thus existing member attributes cannot be deduced by static analysis). It supports qualified module names, as well as Unix pattern matching.*

**Default:** `()`

### \--jobs

*Use multiple processes to speed up Pylint. Specifying 0 will auto-detect the number of processors available to use, and will cap the count on Windows to avoid hangs.*

**Default:** `1`

### \--limit-inference-results

*Control the amount of potential inferred values when inferring a single object. This can help the performance when dealing with large functions or complex, nested conditions.*

**Default:** `100`

### \--load-plugins

*List of plugins (as comma separated values of python module names) to load, usually to register additional checkers.*

**Default:** `()`

### \--msg-template

*Template used to display messages. This is a python new-style format string used to format the message information. See doc for all details.*

**Default:** `""`

### \--output-format

*Set the output format. Available formats are: text, parseable, colorized, json2 (improved json format), json (old json format) and msvs (visual studio). You can also give a reporter class, e.g. mypackage.mymodule.MyReporterClass.*

**Default:** `text`

### \--persistent

*Pickle collected data for later comparisons.*

**Default:** `True`

### \--prefer-stubs

*Resolve imports to .pyi stubs if available. May reduce no-member messages and increase not-an-iterable messages.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--py-version

*Minimum Python version to use for version dependent checks. Will default to the version used to run pylint.*

**Default:** `sys.version_info[:2]`

### \--recursive

*Discover python modules and packages in the file system subtree.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--reports

*Tells whether to display a full report or only the messages.*

**Default:** `False`

### \--score

*Activate the evaluation score.*

**Default:** `True`

### \--source-roots

*Add paths to the list of the source roots. Supports globbing patterns. The source root is an absolute path or a path relative to the current working directory used to determine a package namespace for modules located under the source root.*

**Default:** `()`

### \--suggestion-mode

*When enabled, pylint would attempt to guess common misconfiguration and emit user-friendly hints instead of false-positive error messages.*

**Default:** `True`

### \--unsafe-load-any-extension

*Allow loading of arbitrary C extensions. Extensions are imported into the active Python interpreter and may run arbitrary code.*

**Default:** `False`

# Configuration

Pylint is highly configurable. There are a lot of options to follow the needs of various projects and a lot of checks to activate if they suit your style.

You can generate a sample configuration file with `--generate-toml-config` or `--generate-rcfile`. Every option present on the command line before this will be included in the file.

For example:

    pylint --disable=bare-except,invalid-name --class-rgx='[A-Z][a-z]+' --generate-toml-config

In practice, it is often better to create a minimal configuration file which only contains configuration overrides. For all other options, Pylint will use its default values.

\> **Note** \> The internals that create the configuration files fall back to the default values if no other value was given. This means that some values depend on the interpreter that was used to generate the file. Most notably `py-version` which defaults to the current interpreter.

# Command line installation

Pylint is installable using a package manager. Your package manager will find a version that works with your interpreter. We recommend `pip`:

`` `sh    pip install pylint  Or if you want to also check spelling with ``enchant`(you might need to`<span class="title-ref"> \`install the enchant C library \<https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html\#installing-the-enchant-c-library\></span>\_):

`` `sh    pip install pylint[spelling]  The newest pylint supports all Python interpreters that are not past end of life.  We recommend to use the latest interpreter because we rely on the ``ast`builtin`\` module that gets better with each new Python interpreter. For example a Python 3.6 interpreter can't analyse 3.8 syntax (amongst others, because of the new walrus operator) while a 3.8 interpreter can also deal with Python 3.6. See \[using pylint with multiple interpreters \<continuous-integration\>\](\#using-pylint-with-multiple-interpreters-\<continuous-integration\>) for more details.

# Integrate Pylint with TextMate

Install Pylint in the usual way:

    pip install pylint

Install the [Python bundle for TextMate](https://github.com/textmate/python.tmbundle):

1.  select *TextMate* \> *Preferences*
2.  select the *Bundles* tab
3.  find and tick the *Python* bundle in the list

You should now see it in *Bundles* \> *Python*.

In *Preferences*, select the *Variables* tab. If a `TM_PYCHECKER` variable is not already listed, add it, with the value `pylint`.

The default keyboard shortcut to run the syntax checker is *Control-Shift-V* - open a `.py` file in Textmate, and try it.

You should see the output in a new window:

> PyCheckMate 1.2 – Pylint 1.4.4
> 
> No config file found, using default configuration

Then all is well, and most likely Pylint will have expressed some opinions about your Python code (or will exit with `0` if your code already conforms to its expectations).

If you receive a message:

> Please install PyChecker, PyFlakes, Pylint, PEP 8 or flake8 for more extensive code checking.

That means that Pylint wasn't found, which is likely an issue with command paths - TextMate needs be looking for Pylint on the right paths.

Check where Pylint has been installed, using `which`:

    $ which pylint
    /usr/local/bin/pylint

The output will tell you where Pylint can be found; in this case, in `/usr/local/bin`.

1.  select *TextMate* \> *Preferences*
2.  select the *Variables* tab
3.  find and check that a `PATH` variable exists, and that it contains the appropriate path (if the path to Pylint were `/usr/local/bin/pylint` as above, then the variable would need to contain `/usr/local/bin`). An actual example in this case might be `$PATH:/opt/local/bin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/texbin`, which includes other paths.

... and try running Pylint again.

pre-commit-integration.md

# Pre-commit integration

`pylint` can be used as a [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com) hook. We however discourage it as pylint -- due to its speed -- is more suited to a continuous integration job or a git `pre-push` hook, especially if your repository is large.

Since `pylint` needs to import modules and dependencies to work correctly, the hook only works with a local installation of `pylint` (in your environment). It means it can't be used with `pre-commit.ci`, and you will need to add the following to your `.pre-commit-config.yaml` :

    .. sourcecode:: yaml

>   - ci:  
>     skip: \[pylint\]

Another limitation is that pylint should analyse all your code at once in order to best infer the actual values that result from calls. If only some of the files are given, pylint might miss a particular value's type and produce inferior inference for the subset. Since pre-commit slices the files given to it in order to parallelize the processing, the result can be degraded. It can also be unexpectedly different when the file set changes because the new slicing can change the inference. Thus the `require_serial` option should be set to `true` if correctness and determinism are more important than parallelization to you.

If you installed `pylint` locally it can be added to `.pre-commit-config.yaml` as follows:

``` yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: pylint
      name: pylint
      entry: pylint
      language: system
      types: [python]
      require_serial: true
      args:
        [
          "-rn", # Only display messages
          "-sn", # Don't display the score
        ]
```

You can use `args` to pass command line arguments as described in the \[tutorial\](\#tutorial). A hook with more arguments could look something like this:

``` yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: pylint
      name: pylint
      entry: pylint
      language: system
      types: [python]
      args:
        [
          "-rn", # Only display messages
          "-sn", # Don't display the score
          "--rcfile=pylintrc", # Link to your config file
          "--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.docparams", # Load an extension
        ]
```

# Upgrading pylint

You should probably set the version of pylint in your development environment in order to choose when you actually upgrade pylint's warnings. pylint is following semver versioning. But we can't guarantee that the output between version will stays the same. What this means is that:

  - In **patch release** (`1.2.3`), we only fix false positives and crashes.

You can expect less messages if you set the minor and upgrade to a new patch version. But still, if you enable `useless-suppression` it still means you can get a new `useless-suppression` when a false positive that you disabled is now fixed. Also, if a library you're using was upgraded and is understood better or worse than the previous one, you could get new messages too.

  - In **minor releases** (`1.2.0`), we add checks, remove checks, drop python interpreters past end of life, upgrade astroid minor/major versions and fix false negatives.

You can expect a lot more change in output, the main one being new checks.

  - In **major releases** (`1.0.0`) we change everything else (pylint options, json output, dev API...) while still trying to minimize disruption.

You could have to change the command you're launching or the plugin and editor integration you're using.

# Installation with multiple interpreters

It's possible to analyse code written for older or multiple interpreters by using the `py-version` option and setting it to the oldest supported interpreter of your code. For example you can check that there are no `f-strings` in Python 3.5 code using Python 3.8 with an up-to-date pylint even if Python 3.5 is past end of life (EOL) and the version of pylint you use is not compatible with it.

We do not guarantee that `py-version` will work for all EOL Python interpreters indefinitely, (for anything before Python 3.5, it probably won't). If a newer version does not work for you, the best available pylint might be an old version that works with your old interpreter but without the bug fixes and features of later versions.

# Messages

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="1" hidden="">

messages\_overview.rst message\_control.rst

</div>

## Messages categories

Pylint can emit various messages. These are categorized according to categories corresponding to bit-encoded exit codes:

  - \[Fatal \<fatal-category\>\](\#fatal-\<fatal-category\>) (1)
  - \[Error \<error-category\>\](\#error-\<error-category\>) (2)
  - \[Warning \<warning-category\>\](\#warning-\<warning-category\>) (4)
  - \[Convention \<convention-category\>\](\#convention-\<convention-category\>) (8)
  - \[Refactor \<refactor-category\>\](\#refactor-\<refactor-category\>) (16)
  - \[Information \<information-category\>\](\#information-\<information-category\>) (NA)

An overview of these messages can be found in \[messages-overview\](\#messages-overview)

## Disabling messages

`pylint` has an advanced message control for its checks, offering the ability to enable / disable a message either from the command line or from the configuration file, as well as from the code itself.

For more detail see \[message-control\](\#message-control)

---

message_control.md

---

# Messages control

In order to control messages, `pylint` accepts the following values:

  - a symbolic message: `no-member`, `undefined-variable` etc.
  - a numerical ID: `E1101`, `E1102` etc.
  - The name of the group of checks. You can grab those with `pylint --list-groups`. For example, you can disable / enable all the checks related to type checking, with `typecheck` or all the checks related to variables with `variables`
  - Corresponding category of the checks
      - `C` convention related checks
      - `R` refactoring related checks
      - `W` various warnings
      - `E` errors, for probable bugs in the code
      - `F` fatal, if an error occurred which prevented `pylint` from doing further processing.
  - All the checks with `all`

## Block disables

This describes how the pragma controls operate at a code level.

The pragma controls can disable / enable:

  - All the violations on a single line

<!-- end list -->

``` python
a, b = ... # pylint: disable=unbalanced-tuple-unpacking
```

  - All the violations on the following line

<!-- end list -->

``` python
# pylint: disable-next=unbalanced-tuple-unpacking
a, b = ...
```

  - All the violations in a single scope

<!-- end list -->

``` python
def test():
    # Disable all the no-member violations in this function
    # pylint: disable=no-member
    ...
```

  - All the violations in a <span class="title-ref">block</span>. For instance, each separate branch of an `if` statement is considered a separate block, as in the following example:

<!-- end list -->

``` python
def meth5(self):
    # pylint: disable=no-member
    # no error
    print(self.bla)
    if self.blop:
        # pylint: enable=no-member
        # enable all no-members for this block
        print(self.blip)
    else:
        # This is affected by the scope disable
        print(self.blip)
    # pylint: enable=no-member
    print(self.blip)
    if self.blop:
        # pylint: disable=no-member
        # disable all no-members for this block
        print(self.blip)
    else:
        # This emits a violation
        print(self.blip)
```

  - If the violation occurs on a block starting line, then it applies only to that line

<!-- end list -->

``` python
if self.blop: # pylint: disable=no-member; applies only to this line
    # Here we get an error
    print(self.blip)
else:
    # error
    print(self.blip)
```

Here's an example with all these rules in a single place:

``` python
"""pylint option block-disable"""

__revision__ = None

class Foo(object):
    """block-disable test"""

    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def meth1(self, arg):
        """this issues a message"""
        print(self)

    def meth2(self, arg):
        """and this one not"""
        # pylint: disable=unused-argument
        print(self\
              + "foo")

    def meth3(self):
        """test one line disabling"""
        # no error
        print(self.bla) # pylint: disable=no-member
        # error
        print(self.blop)

    def meth4(self):
        """test re-enabling"""
        # pylint: disable=no-member
        # no error
        print(self.bla)
        print(self.blop)
        # pylint: enable=no-member
        # error
        print(self.blip)

    def meth5(self):
        """test IF sub-block re-enabling"""
        # pylint: disable=no-member
        # no error
        print(self.bla)
        if self.blop:
            # pylint: enable=no-member
            # error
            print(self.blip)
        else:
            # no error
            print(self.blip)
        # no error
        print(self.blip)

    def meth6(self):
        """test TRY/EXCEPT sub-block re-enabling"""
        # pylint: disable=no-member
        # no error
        print(self.bla)
        try:
            # pylint: enable=no-member
            # error
            print(self.blip)
        except UndefinedName: # pylint: disable=undefined-variable
            # no error
            print(self.blip)
        # no error
        print(self.blip)

    def meth7(self):
        """test one line block opening disabling"""
        if self.blop: # pylint: disable=no-member
            # error
            print(self.blip)
        else:
            # error
            print(self.blip)
        # error
        print(self.blip)

    def meth8(self):
        """test late disabling"""
        # error
        print(self.blip)
        # pylint: disable=no-member
        # no error
        print(self.bla)
        print(self.blop)

    def meth9(self):
        """test next line disabling"""
        # no error
        # pylint: disable-next=no-member
        print(self.bla)
        # error
        print(self.blop)
```

## Detecting useless disables

As pylint gets better and false positives are removed, disables that became useless can accumulate and clutter the code. In order to clean them you can enable the `useless-suppression` warning.

# Pylint output

## Output options

Output by default is written to stdout. The simplest way to output to a file is with the `--output=<filename>` option.

The default format for the output is raw text. You can change this by passing pylint the `--output-format=<value>` option. Possible values are: `text`, `json`, `parseable`, `colorized` and `msvs` (for Visual Studio).

Multiple output formats can be used at the same time by passing a comma-separated list of formats to `--output-format`. This output can be redirected to a file by giving a filename after a colon.

For example, to save a json report to `somefile.json` and print a colorized report to stdout at the same time: :

    --output-format=json:somefile.json,colorized

## Custom message formats

You can customize the exact way information are displayed using the <span class="title-ref">--msg-template=\<format string\></span> option. The <span class="title-ref">format string</span> uses the [Python new format syntax](https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#formatstrings) and the following fields are available :

  - path  
    relative path to the file

  - abspath  
    absolute path to the file

  - line  
    line number

  - column  
    column number

  - end\_line  
    line number of the end of the node

  - end\_column  
    column number of the end of the node

  - module  
    module name

  - obj  
    object within the module (if any)

  - msg  
    text of the message

  - msg\_id  
    the message code (eg. I0011)

  - symbol  
    symbolic name of the message (eg. locally-disabled)

  - C  
    one letter indication of the message category

  - category  
    fullname of the message category

For example, the former (pre 1.0) default format can be obtained with:

    pylint --msg-template='{msg_id}:{line:3d},{column}: {obj}: {msg}'

A few other examples:

  - the default format:
    
        {path}:{line}:{column}: {msg_id}: {msg} ({symbol})

  - Visual Studio compatible format (former 'msvs' output format):
    
        {path}({line}): [{msg_id}{obj}] {msg}

  - Parseable (Emacs and all, former 'parseable' output format) format:
    
        {path}:{line}: [{msg_id}({symbol}), {obj}] {msg}

The `--msg-template` option can only be combined with text-based reporters (`--output-format` either unspecified or one of: parseable, colorized or msvs). If both `--output-format` and `--msg-template` are specified, the `--msg-template` option will take precedence over the default line format defined by the reporter class.

If `end_line` or `end_column` are `None`, they will be represented as an empty string by the default `TextReporter`.

## Source code analysis section

For each python module, Pylint will first display a few '\*' characters followed by the name of the module. Then, a number of messages with the following format: :

    MESSAGE_TYPE: LINE_NUM:[OBJECT:] MESSAGE

You can get another output format, useful since it's recognized by most editors or other development tools using the `--output-format=parseable` option.

The message type can be:

>   - \[I\]nformational messages that Pylint emits (do not contribute to your analysis score)
>   - \[R\]efactor for a "good practice" metric violation
>   - \[C\]onvention for coding standard violation
>   - \[W\]arning for stylistic problems, or minor programming issues
>   - \[E\]rror for important programming issues (i.e. most probably bug)
>   - \[F\]atal for errors which prevented further processing

Sometimes the line of code which caused the error is displayed with a caret pointing to the error. This may be generalized in future versions of Pylint.

Example (extracted from a run of Pylint on itself...):

    ************* Module pylint.checkers.format
    W: 50: Too long line (86/80)
    W:108: Operator not followed by a space
         print >>sys.stderr, 'Unable to match %r', line
                ^
    W:141: Too long line (81/80)
    W: 74:searchall: Unreachable code
    W:171:FormatChecker.process_tokens: Redefining built-in (type)
    W:150:FormatChecker.process_tokens: Too many local variables (20/15)
    W:150:FormatChecker.process_tokens: Too many branches (13/12)

## Reports section

Following the analysis message, Pylint can display a set of reports, each one focusing on a particular aspect of the project, such as number of messages by categories, modules dependencies. These features can be enabled through the `--reports=y` option, or its shorthand version `-ry`.

For instance, the metrics report displays summaries gathered from the current run.

>   - the number of processed modules
>   - for each module, the percentage of errors and warnings
>   - the total number of errors and warnings
>   - percentage of classes, functions and modules with docstrings, and a comparison from the previous run
>   - percentage of classes, functions and modules with correct name (according to the coding standard), and a comparison from the previous run
>   - a list of external dependencies found in the code, and where they appear

## Score section

Finally, Pylint displays a global evaluation score for the code, rated out of a maximum score of 10.0. This output can be suppressed through the `--score=n` option, or its shorthand version `-sn`.

The evaluation formula can be overridden with the `--evaluation=<python_expression>` option.

# Running Pylint

## On module packages or directories

Pylint is meant to be called from the command line. The usage is :

    pylint [options] modules_or_packages

By default the `pylint` command only accepts a list of python modules and packages. On versions below 2.15, specifying a directory that is not an explicit package (with `__init__.py`) results in an error:

    pylint mydir
    ************* Module mydir
    mydir/__init__.py:1:0: F0010: error while code parsing: Unable to load file mydir/__init__.py:
    [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'mydir/__init__.py' (parse-error)

Thus, on versions before 2.15 using the `--recursive=y` option allows for linting a namespace package:

    pylint --recursive=y mydir mymodule mypackage

This option makes `pylint` attempt to discover all modules (files ending with `.py` extension) and all explicit packages (all directories containing a `__init__.py` file).

Pylint **will not import** this package or module, but it does use Python internals to locate them and as such is subject to the same rules and configuration. You should pay attention to your `PYTHONPATH`, since it is a common error to analyze an installed version of a module instead of the development version.

## On files

It is also possible to analyze Python files, with a few restrictions. As a convenience, you can give it a file name if it's possible to guess a module name from the file's path using the python path. Some examples:

`pylint mymodule.py` should always work since the current working directory is automatically added on top of the python path

`pylint directory/mymodule.py` will work if: `directory` is a python package (i.e. has an `__init__.py` file), an implicit namespace package or if `directory` is in the python path.

## With implicit namespace packages

If the analyzed sources use implicit namespace packages (PEP 420), the source root(s) should be specified using the `--source-roots` option. Otherwise, the package names are detected incorrectly, since implicit namespace packages don't contain an `__init__.py`.

## Globbing support

It is also possible to specify both directories and files using globbing patterns:

    pylint [options] packages/*/src

## Command line options

<div id="run_command_line">

First of all, we have two basic (but useful) options.

</div>

\--version show program's version number and exit -h, --help show help about the command line options

Pylint is architected around several checkers. You can disable a specific checker or some of its messages or message categories by specifying `--disable=<symbol>`. If you want to enable only some checkers or some message symbols, first use `--disable=all` then `--enable=<symbol>` with `<symbol>` being a comma-separated list of checker names and message symbols. See the list of available features for a description of provided checkers with their functionalities. The `--disable` and `--enable` options can be used with comma-separated lists mixing checkers, message ids and categories like `-d C,W,no-error,design`

It is possible to disable all messages with `--disable=all`. This is useful to enable only a few checkers or a few messages by first disabling everything, and then re-enabling only what you need.

Each checker has some specific options, which can take either a yes/no value, an integer, a python regular expression, or a comma-separated list of values (which are generally used to override a regular expression in special cases). For a full list of options, use `--help`

Specifying all the options suitable for your setup and coding standards can be tedious, so it is possible to use a configuration file to specify the default values. You can specify a configuration file on the command line using the `--rcfile` option. Otherwise, Pylint searches for a configuration file in the following order and uses the first one it finds:

1.  `pylintrc` in the current working directory
2.  `pylintrc.toml` in the current working directory, providing it has at least one `tool.pylint.` section.
3.  `.pylintrc` in the current working directory
4.  `.pylintrc.toml` in the current working directory, providing it has at least one `tool.pylint.` section.
5.  `pyproject.toml` in the current working directory, providing it has at least one `tool.pylint.` section. The `pyproject.toml` must prepend section names with `tool.pylint.`, for example `[tool.pylint.'MESSAGES CONTROL']`. They can also be passed in on the command line.
6.  `setup.cfg` in the current working directory, providing it has at least one `pylint.` section
7.  `tox.ini` in the current working directory, providing it has at least one `pylint.` section
8.  Pylint will search for the `pyproject.toml` file up the directories hierarchy unless it's found, or a `.git`/`.hg` directory is found, or the file system root is approached.
9.  If the current working directory is in a Python package, Pylint searches up the hierarchy of Python packages until it finds a `pylintrc` file. This allows you to specify coding standards on a module-by-module basis. Of course, a directory is judged to be a Python package if it contains an `__init__.py` file.
10. The file named by environment variable `PYLINTRC`
11. if you have a home directory which isn't `/root`:
    1.  `.pylintrc` in your home directory
    2.  `.config/pylintrc` in your home directory
12. `/etc/pylintrc`

The `--generate-toml-config` option will generate a commented configuration file on standard output according to the current configuration and exit. This includes:

  - Any configuration file found as explained above
  - Options appearing before `--generate-toml-config` on the Pylint command line

Of course you can also start with the default values and hand-tune the configuration.

Other useful global options include:

  - \--ignore=\<file\[,file...\]\> Files or directories to be skipped. They should be  
    base names, not paths.

\--output-format=\<format\> Select output format (text, json, custom). --msg-template=\<template\> Modify text output message template. --list-msgs Generate pylint's messages. --list-msgs-enabled Display a list of what messages are enabled and disabled with the given configuration. --full-documentation Generate pylint's full documentation, in reST format.

## Parallel execution

It is possible to speed up the execution of Pylint. If the running computer has more CPUs than one, then the work for checking all files could be spread across all cores via Pylints's sub-processes.

This functionality is exposed via the `-j` command-line parameter. If the provided number is 0, then the total number of CPUs will be autodetected and used.

Example:

    pylint -j 4 mymodule1.py mymodule2.py mymodule3.py mymodule4.py

This will spawn 4 parallel Pylint sub-process, where each provided module will be checked in parallel. Discovered problems by checkers are not displayed immediately. They are shown just after checking a module is complete.

You can also do your own parallelization by launching pylint multiple times on subsets of your files (like `pre-commit` with the default `require_serial=false` does). Be aware, though: pylint should analyse all your code at once in order to best infer the actual values that result from calls. If only some of the files are given, pylint might miss a particular value's type and produce inferior inference for the subset. It can also be unexpectedly different when the file set changes because the new slicing can change the inference. So, don't do this if correctness and determinism are important to you.

## Exit codes

Pylint returns bit-encoded exit codes.

| exit code | meaning                   |
| --------- | ------------------------- |
| 0         | no error                  |
| 1         | fatal message issued      |
| 2         | error message issued      |
| 4         | warning message issued    |
| 8         | refactor message issued   |
| 16        | convention message issued |
| 32        | usage error               |

For example, an exit code of `20` means there was at least one warning message (4) and at least one convention message (16) and nothing else.

# 0.x

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

Ticket numbers are almost always internal to Logilab, some come from bitbucket.

# What's New In Pylint 1.4

## What's New in Pylint 1.4.3?

Release date: 2015-03-14

  - Remove three warnings: star-args, abstract-class-little-used, abstract-class-not-used. These warnings don't add any real value and they don't imply errors or problems in the code.
  - Added a new option for controlling the peephole optimizer in astroid. The option `--optimize-ast` will control the peephole optimizer, which is used to optimize a couple of AST subtrees. The current problem solved by the peephole optimizer is when multiple joined strings, with the addition operator, are encountered. If the numbers of such strings is high enough, Pylint will then fail with a maximum recursion depth exceeded error, due to its visitor architecture. The peephole just transforms such calls, if it can, into the final resulting string and this exhibit a problem, because the visit\_binop method stops being called (in the optimized AST it will be a Const node).

## What's New in Pylint 1.4.2?

Release date: 2015-03-11

  - Don't require a docstring for empty modules.
    
    Closes \#261

  - Fix a false positive with `too-few-format-args` string warning, emitted when the string format contained a normal positional argument ('{0}'), mixed with a positional argument which did an attribute access ('{0.\_\_class\_\_}').
    
    Closes \#463

  - Take in account all the methods from the ancestors when checking for too-few-public-methods.
    
    Closes \#471

  - Catch enchant errors and emit 'invalid-characters-in-docstring' when checking for spelling errors.
    
    Closes \#469

  - Use all the inferred statements for the super-init-not-called check.
    
    Closes \#389

  - Add a new warning, 'unichr-builtin', emitted by the Python 3 porting checker, when the unichr builtin is found.
    
    Closes \#472

  - Add a new warning, 'intern-builtin', emitted by the Python 3 porting checker, when the intern builtin is found.
    
    Closes \#473

  - Add support for editable installations.

  - The HTML output accepts the `--msg-template` option. Patch by Dan Goldsmith.

  - Add 'map-builtin-not-iterating' (replacing 'implicit-map-evaluation'), 'zip-builtin-not-iterating', 'range-builtin-not-iterating', and 'filter-builtin-not-iterating' which are emitted by `--py3k` when the appropriate built-in is not used in an iterating context (semantics taken from 2to3).

  - Add a new warning, 'unidiomatic-typecheck', emitted when an explicit typecheck uses type() instead of isinstance(). For example, <span class="title-ref">type(x) == Y</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">isinstance(x, Y)</span>. Patch by Chris Rebert.
    
    Closes \#299

  - Add support for combining the Python 3 checker mode with the --jobs flag (--py3k and --jobs).
    
    Closes \#467

  - Add a new warning for the Python 3 porting checker, 'using-cmp-argument', emitted when the `cmp` argument for the `list.sort` or `sorted builtin` is encountered.

  - Make the --py3k flag commutative with the -E flag. Also, this patch fixes the leaks of error messages from the Python 3 checker when the errors mode was activated.
    
    Closes \#437

## What's New in Pylint 1.4.1?

Release date: 2015-01-16

  - Look only in the current function's scope for bad-super-call.
    
    Closes \#403

    Closes \#421

  - Add a new warning, 'redundant-unittest-assert', emitted when using unittest's methods assertTrue and assertFalse with constant value as argument. Patch by Vlad Temian.

  - Add a new JSON reporter, usable through -f flag.

  - Add the method names for the 'signature-differs' and 'argument-differs' warnings.
    
    Closes \#433

  - Fix a crash which occurred when using multiple jobs and the files given as argument didn't exist at all.

## What's New in Pylint 1.4.0?

Release date: 2014-11-23

  - Added new options for controlling the loading of C extensions. By default, only C extensions from the stdlib will be loaded into the active Python interpreter for inspection, because they can run arbitrary code on import. The option `--extension-pkg-whitelist` can be used to specify modules or packages that are safe to load.

  - Change default max-line-length to 100 rather than 80

  - Drop BaseRawChecker class which were only there for backward compatibility for a while now

  - Don't try to analyze string formatting with objects coming from function arguments.
    
    Closes \#373

  - Port source code to be Python 2/3 compatible. This drops the need for 2to3, but does drop support for Python 2.5.

  - Each message now comes with a confidence level attached, and can be filtered base on this level. This allows to filter out all messages that were emitted even though an inference failure happened during checking.

  - Improved presenting unused-import message.
    
    Closes \#293

  - Add new checker for finding spelling errors. New messages: wrong-spelling-in-comment, wrong-spelling-in-docstring. New options: spelling-dict, spelling-ignore-words.

  - Add new '-j' option for running checks in sub-processes.

  - Added new checks for line endings if they are mixed (LF vs CRLF) or if they are not as expected. New messages: mixed-line-endings, unexpected-line-ending-format. New option: expected-line-ending-format.

  - 'dangerous-default-value' no longer evaluates the value of the arguments, which could result in long error messages or sensitive data being leaked.
    
    Closes \#282

  - Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when encountering a string which uses only position-based arguments.
    
    Closes \#285

  - Fix a false positive with string formatting checker, when using keyword argument packing.
    
    Closes \#288

  - Proper handle class level scope for lambdas.

  - Handle 'too-few-format-args' or 'too-many-format-args' for format strings with both named and positional fields.
    
    Closes \#286

  - Analyze only strings by the string format checker.
    
    Closes \#287

    Closes \#296

  - Don't emit 'import-error' if an import was protected by a try-except, which excepted ImportError.

  - Fix an 'unused-import' false positive, when the error was emitted for all the members imported with 'from import' form.
    
    Closes \#304

  - Don't emit 'invalid-name' when assigning a name in an ImportError handler.
    
    Closes \#302

  - Don't count branches from nested functions.

  - Fix a false positive with 'too-few-format-args', when the format strings contains duplicate manual position arguments.
    
    Closes \#310

  - fixme regex handles comments without spaces after the hash.
    
    Closes \#311

  - Don't emit 'unused-import' when a special object is imported (\_\_all\_\_, \_\_doc\_\_ etc.).
    
    Closes \#309

  - Look in the metaclass, if defined, for members not found in the current class.
    
    Closes \#306

  - Don't emit 'protected-access' if the attribute is accessed using a property defined at the class level.

  - Detect calls of the parent's \_\_init\_\_, through a binded super() call.

  - Check that a class has an explicitly defined metaclass before emitting 'old-style-class' for Python 2.

  - Emit 'catching-non-exception' for non-class nodes.
    
    Closes \#303

  - Order of reporting is consistent.

  - Add a new warning, 'boolean-datetime', emitted when an instance of 'datetime.time' is used in a boolean context.
    
    Closes \#239

  - Fix a crash which occurred while checking for 'method-hidden', when the parent frame was something different than a function.

  - Generate html output for missing files.
    
    Closes \#320

  - Fix a false positive with 'too-many-format-args', when the format string contains mixed attribute access arguments and manual fields.
    
    Closes \#322

  - Extend the cases where 'undefined-variable' and 'used-before-assignment' can be detected.
    
    Closes \#291

  - Add support for customising callback identifiers, by adding a new '--callbacks' command line option.
    
    Closes \#326

  - Don't emit 'unbalanced-tuple-unpacking' when the rhs of the assignment is a variable length argument.
    
    Closes \#329

  - Add a new warning, 'inherit-non-class', emitted when a class inherits from something which is not a class.
    
    Closes \#331

  - Fix another false positives with 'undefined-variable', where the variable can be found as a class assignment and used in a function annotation.
    
    Closes \#342

  - Handle assignment of the string format method to a variable.
    
    Closes \#351

  - Support wheel packaging format for PyPi.
    
    Closes \#334

  - Check that various built-ins that do not exist in Python 3 are not used: apply, basestring, buffer, cmp, coerce, execfile, file, long raw\_input, reduce, StandardError, unicode, reload and xrange.

  - Warn for magic methods which are not used in any way in Python 3: \_\_coerce\_\_, \_\_delslice\_\_, \_\_getslice\_\_, \_\_setslice\_\_, \_\_cmp\_\_, \_\_oct\_\_, \_\_nonzero\_\_ and \_\_hex\_\_.

  - Don't emit 'assigning-non-slot' when the assignment is for a property.
    
    Closes \#359

  - Fix for regression: '{path}' was no longer accepted in '--msg-template'.

  - Report the percentage of all messages, not just for errors and warnings.
    
    Closes \#319

  - 'too-many-public-methods' is reported only for methods defined in a class, not in its ancestors.
    
    Closes \#248

  - 'too-many-lines' disable pragma can be located on any line, not only the first.
    
    Closes \#321

  - Warn in Python 2 when an import statement is found without a corresponding `from __future__ import absolute_import`.

  - Warn in Python 2 when a non-floor division operation is found without a corresponding `from __future__ import division`.

  - Add a new option, 'exclude-protected', for excluding members from the protected-access warning.
    
    Closes \#48

  - Warn in Python 2 when using dict.iter\*(), dict.view\*(); none of these methods are available in Python 3.

  - Warn in Python 2 when calling an object's next() method; Python 3 uses \_\_next\_\_() instead.

  - Warn when assigning to \_\_metaclass\_\_ at a class scope; in Python 3 a metaclass is specified as an argument to the 'class' statement.

  - Warn when performing parameter tuple unpacking; it is not supported in Python 3.

  - 'abstract-class-instantiated' is also emitted for Python 2. It was previously disabled.

  - Add 'long-suffix' error, emitted when encountering the long suffix on numbers.

  - Add support for disabling a checker, by specifying an 'enabled' attribute on the checker class.

  - Add a new CLI option, --py3k, for enabling Python 3 porting mode. This mode will disable all other checkers and will emit warnings and errors for constructs which are invalid or removed in Python 3.

  - Add 'old-octal-literal' to Python 3 porting checker, emitted when encountering octals with the old syntax.

  - Add 'implicit-map-evaluation' to Python 3 porting checker, emitted when encountering the use of map builtin, without explicit evaluation.

# What's New In Pylint 1.5

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.5?

Release date: 2016-03-21

  - Let visit\_importfrom from Python 3 porting checker be called when everything is disabled
    
    Because the visit method was filtering the patterns it was expecting to be activated, it didn't run when everything but one pattern was disabled, leading to spurious false positives
    
    Closes \#852

  - Don't emit unsubscriptable-value for classes with unknown base classes.
    
    Closes \#776.

  - Use an OrderedDict for storing the configuration elements
    
    This fixes an issue related to impredictible order of the disable / enable elements from a config file. In certain cases, the disable was coming before the enable which resulted in classes of errors to be enabled, even though the intention was to disable them. The best example for this was in the context of running multiple processes, each one of it having different enables / disables that affected the output.
    
    Closes \#815

  - Don't consider bare and broad except handlers as ignoring NameError, AttributeError and similar exceptions, in the context of checkers for these issues.
    
    Closes \#826

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.4?

Release date: 2016-01-15

  - Merge StringMethodChecker with StringFormatChecker. This fixes a bug where disabling all the messages and enabling only a handful of messages from the StringFormatChecker would have resulted in no messages at all.
  - Don't apply unneeded-not over sets.

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.3?

Release date: 2016-01-11

  - Handle the import fallback idiom with regard to wrong-import-order.
    
    Closes \#750

  - Decouple the displaying of reports from the displaying of messages
    
    Some reporters are aggregating the messages instead of displaying them when they are available. The actual displaying was conflatted in the generate\_reports. Unfortunately this behaviour was flaky and in the case of the JSON reporter, the messages weren't shown at all if a file had syntax errors or if it was missing. In order to fix this, the aggregated messages can now be displayed with Reporter.display\_message, while the reports are displayed with display\_reports.
    
    Closes \#766 Closes \#765

  - Ignore function calls with variadic arguments without a context.
    
    Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter. In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected.
    
    Closes \#722

  - Treat AsyncFunctionDef just like FunctionDef nodes, by implementing visit\_asyncfunctiondef in terms of visit\_functiondef.
    
    Closes \#767

  - Take in account kwonlyargs when verifying that arguments are defined with the check\_docs extension.
    
    Closes \#745

  - Suppress reporting 'unneeded-not' inside `__ne__` methods
    
    Closes \#749

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.2?

Release date: 2015-12-21

  - Don't crash if graphviz is not installed, instead emit a warning letting the user to know.
    
    Closes \#168

  - Accept only functions and methods for the deprecated-method checker.
    
    This prevents a crash which can occur when an object doesn't have .qname() method after the inference.

  - Don't emit super-on-old-class on classes with unknown bases.
    
    Closes \#721

  - Allow statements in `if` or `try` blocks containing imports.
    
    Closes \#714

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.1?

Release date: 2015-12-02

  - Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered in plugin modules.
    
    Closes \#711

  - Add wrong-import-position to check\_messages's decorator arguments for ImportChecker.leave\_module This fixes an esoteric bug which occurs when ungrouped-imports and wrong-import-order are disabled and pylint is executed on multiple files. What happens is that without wrong-import-position in check\_messages, leave\_module will never be called, which means that the first non-import node from other files might leak into the current file, leading to wrong-import-position being emitted by pylint.

  - Fix a crash which occurred when old visit methods are encountered in plugin modules.
    
    Closes \#711

  - Don't emit import-self and cyclic-import for relative imports of modules with the same name as the package itself.
    
    Closes \#708 Closes \#706.

## What's New in Pylint 1.5.0?

Release date: 2015-11-29

  - Added multiple warnings related to imports. 'wrong-import-order' is emitted when PEP 8 recommendations regarding imports are not respected (that is, standard imports should be followed by third-party imports and then by local imports). 'ungrouped-imports' is emitted when imports from the same package or module are not placed together, but scattered around in the code. 'wrong-import-position' is emitted when code is mixed with imports, being recommended for the latter to be at the top of the file, in order to figure out easier by a human reader what dependencies a module has.
    
    Closes \#692

  - Added a new refactoring warning, 'unneeded-not', emitted when an expression with the not operator could be simplified.
    
    Closes \#670

  - Added a new refactoring warning, 'simplifiable-if-statement', used when an if statement could be reduced to a boolean evaluation of its test.
    
    Closes \#698

  - Added a new refactoring warning, 'too-many-boolean-expressions', used when an if statement contains too many boolean expressions, which makes the code less maintainable and harder to understand.
    
    Closes \#677

  - Property methods are shown as attributes instead of functions in pyreverse class diagrams.
    
    Closes \#284

  - Add a new refactoring error, 'too-many-nested-blocks', which is emitted when a function or a method has too many nested blocks, which makes the code less readable and harder to understand.
    
    Closes \#668

  - Add a new error, 'unsubscriptable-object', that is emitted when value used in subscription expression doesn't support subscription (i.e. doesn't define \_\_getitem\_\_ method).

  - Don't warn about abstract classes instantiated in their own body.
    
    Closes \#627

  - Obsolete options are not present by default in the generated configuration file.
    
    Closes \#632

  - non-iterator-returned can detect classes with iterator-metaclasses.
    
    Closes \#679

  - Add a new error, 'unsupported-membership-test', emitted when value to the right of the 'in' operator doesn't support membership test protocol (i.e. doesn't define \_\_contains\_\_/\_\_iter\_\_/\_\_getitem\_\_)

  - Add new errors, 'not-an-iterable', emitted when non-iterable value is used in an iterating context (starargs, for-statement, comprehensions, etc), and 'not-a-mapping', emitted when non-mapping value is used in a mapping context.
    
    Closes \#563

  - Make 'no-self-use' checker not emit a warning if there is a 'super()' call inside the method.
    
    Closes \#667

  - Add checker to identify multiple imports on one line.
    
    Closes \#598

  - Fix unused-argument false positive when the "+=" operator is used.
    
    Closes \#518

  - Don't emit import-error for ignored modules. PyLint will not emit import errors for any import which is, or is a subpackage of, a module in the ignored-modules list.
    
    Closes \#223

  - Fix unused-import false positive when the import is used in a class assignment.
    
    Closes \#475

  - Add a new error, 'not-context-manager', emitted when something that doesn't implement \_\_enter\_\_ and \_\_exit\_\_ is used in a with statement.

  - Add a new warning, 'confusing-with-statement', emitted by the base checker, when an ambiguous looking with statement is used. For example <span class="title-ref">with open() as first, second</span> which looks like a tuple assignment but is actually 2 context managers.

  - Add a new warning, 'duplicate-except', emitted when there is an exception handler which handles an exception type that was handled before.
    
    Closes \#485

  - A couple of warnings got promoted to errors, since they could uncover potential bugs in the code. These warnings are: assignment-from-none, unbalanced-tuple-unpacking, unpacking-non-sequence, non-iterator-returned.
    
    Closes \#388

  - Allow ending a pragma control with a semicolon. In this way, users can continue a pragma control with a reason for why it is used, as in <span class="title-ref">\# pylint: disable=old-style-class;reason=...</span>.
    
    Closes \#449

  - \--jobs can be used with --load-plugins now.
    
    Closes \#456

  - Improve the performance of --jobs when dealing only with a package name.
    
    Closes \#479

  - Don't emit an unused-wildcard-import when the imported name comes from another module and it is in fact a \_\_future\_\_ name.

  - The colorized reporter now works on Windows.
    
    Closes \#96.

  - Remove pointless-except warning. It was previously disabled by default and it wasn't very useful.
    
    Closes \#506.

  - Fix a crash on Python 3 related to the string checker, which crashed when it encountered a bytes string with a .format method called.

  - Don't warn about no-self-use for builtin properties.

  - Fix a false positive for bad-reversed-sequence, when a subclass of a `dict` provides a \_\_reversed\_\_ method.

  - Change the default no-docstring-rgx so missing-docstring isn't emitted for private functions.

  - Don't emit redefined-outer-name for \_\_future\_\_ directives.
    
    Closes \#520.

  - Provide some hints for the bad-builtin message.
    
    Closes \#522.

  - When checking for invalid arguments to a callable, in typecheck.py, look up for the \_\_init\_\_ in case the found \_\_new\_\_ comes from builtins.
    
    Since the \_\_new\_\_ comes from builtins, it will not have attached any information regarding what parameters it expects, so the check will be useless. Retrieving \_\_init\_\_ in that case will at least detect a couple of false negatives.
    
    Closes \#429.

  - Don't emit no-member for classes with unknown bases.
    
    Since we don't know what those bases might add, we simply ignore the error in this case.

  - Lookup in the implicit metaclass when checking for no-member, if the class in question has an implicit metaclass, which is True for new style classes.
    
    Closes \#438.

  - Add two new warnings, duplicate-bases and inconsistent-mro.
    
    duplicate-bases is emitted when a class has the same bases listed more than once in its bases definition, while inconsistent-mro is emitted when no sane mro hierarchy can be determined.
    
    Closes \#526.

  - Remove interface-not-implemented warning.
    
    Closes \#532.

  - Remove the rest of interface checks: interface-is-not-class, missing-interface-method, unresolved-interface. The reason is that it's better to start recommending ABCs instead of the old Zope era of interfaces. One side effect of this change is that ignore-iface-methods becomes a noop, it's deprecated and it will be removed at some time.

  - Emit a proper deprecation warning for reporters.BaseReporter.add\_message.
    
    The alternative way is to use handle\_message. add\_message will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

  - Added new module 'extensions' for optional checkers with the test directory 'test/extensions' and documentation file 'doc/extensions.rst'.

  - Added new checker 'extensions.check\_docs' that verifies parameter documentation in Sphinx, Google, and Numpy style.

  - Detect undefined variable cases, where the "definition" of an undefined variable was in del statement. Instead of emitting used-before-assignment, which is totally misleading, it now emits undefined-variable.
    
    Closes \#528.

  - Don't emit attribute-defined-outside-init and access-member-before-definition for mixin classes. Actual errors can occur in mixin classes, but this is controlled by the ignore-mixin-members option.
    
    Closes \#412.

  - Improve the detection of undefined variables and variables used before assignment for variables used as default arguments to function, where the variable was first defined in the class scope.
    
    Closes \#342 and issue \#404.

  - Add a new warning, 'unexpected-special-method-signature', which is emitted when a special method (dunder method) doesn't have the expected signature, which can lead to actual errors in the application code.
    
    Closes \#253.

  - Remove 'bad-context-manager' due to the inclusion of 'unexpected-special-method-signature'.

  - Don't emit no-name-in-module if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or a bare except clause.

  - Don't emit no-member if the attribute access node is protected by an except handler, which handles AttributeError, Exception or it is a bare except.

  - Don't emit import-error if the import is guarded by an ImportError, Exception or a bare except clause.

  - Don't emit undefined-variable if the node is guarded by a NameError, Exception or bare except clause.

  - Add a new warning, 'using-constant-test', which is emitted when a conditional statement (If, IfExp) uses a test which is always constant, such as numbers, classes, functions etc. This is most likely an error from the user's part.
    
    Closes \#524.

  - Don't emit 'raising-non-exception' when the exception has unknown bases. We don't know what those bases actually are and it's better to assume that the user knows what he is doing rather than emitting a message which can be considered a false positive.

  - Look for a .pylintrc configuration file in the current folder, if pylintrc is not found. Dotted pylintrc files will not be searched in the parents of the current folder, as it is done for pylintrc.

  - Add a new error, 'invalid-unary-type-operand', emitted when an unary operand is used on something which doesn't support that operation (for instance, using the unary bitwise inversion operator on an instance which doesn't implement \_\_invert\_\_).

  - Take in consideration differences between arguments of various type of functions (classmethods, staticmethods, properties) when checking for `arguments-differ`.
    
    Closes \#548.

  - astroid.inspector was moved to pylint.pyreverse, since it belongs there and it doesn't need to be in astroid.

  - astroid.utils.LocalsVisitor was moved to pylint.pyreverse.LocalsVisitor.

  - pylint.checkers.utils.excepts\_import\_error was removed. Use pylint.checkers.utils.error\_of\_type instead.

  - Don't emit undefined-all-variables for nodes which can't be inferred (YES nodes).

  - yield-outside-func is also emitted for `yield from`.

  - Add a new error, 'too-many-star-expressions', emitted when there are more than one starred expression (<span class="title-ref">\*x</span>) in an assignment. The warning is emitted only on Python 3.

  - Add a new error, 'invalid-star-assignment-target', emitted when a starred expression (<span class="title-ref">\*x</span>) is used as the lhs side of an assignment, as in <span class="title-ref">\*x = \[1, 2\]</span>. This is not a SyntaxError on Python 3 though.

  - Detect a couple of objects which can't be base classes (bool, slice, range and memoryview, which weren't detected until now).

  - Add a new error for the Python 3 porting checker, `import-star-module-level`, which is used when a star import is detected in another scope than the module level, which is an error on Python 3. Using this will emit a SyntaxWarning on Python 2.

  - Add a new error, 'star-needs-assignment-target', emitted on Python 3 when a Starred expression (<span class="title-ref">\*x</span>) is not used in an assignment target. This is not caught when parsing the AST on Python 3, so it needs to be a separate check.

  - Add a new error, 'unsupported-binary-operation', emitted when two a binary arithmetic operation is executed between two objects which don't support it (a number plus a string for instance). This is currently disabled, since the it exhibits way too many false positives, but it will be re-enabled as soon as possible.

  - New imported features from astroid into pyreverse: pyreverse.inspector.Project, pyreverse.inspector.project\_from\_files and pyreverse.inspector.interfaces.
    
    These were moved since they didn't belong in astroid.

  - Enable misplaced-future for Python 3.
    
    Closes \#580.

  - Add a new error, 'nonlocal-and-global', which is emitted when a name is found to be both nonlocal and global in the same scope.
    
    Closes \#581.

  - ignored-classes option can work with qualified names (ignored-classes=optparse.Values)
    
    Closes \#297

  - ignored-modules can work with qualified names as well as with Unix pattern matching for recursive ignoring.
    
    Closes \#244

  - Improve detection of relative imports in non-packages, as well as importing missing modules with a relative import from a package.

  - Don't emit no-init if not all the bases from a class are known.
    
    Closes \#604.

  - \--no-space-check option accepts `empty-line` as a possible option.
    
    Closes \#541.

  - \--generate-rcfile generates by default human readable symbols for the --disable option.
    
    Closes \#608.

  - Improved the not-in-loop checker to properly detect more cases.

  - Add a new error, 'continue-in-finally', which is emitted when the `continue` keyword is found inside a `finally` clause, which is a SyntaxError.

  - The --zope flag is deprecated and it is slated for removal in Pylint 1.6.
    
    The reason behind this removal is the fact that it's a specialized flag and there are solutions for the original problem: use --generated-members with the members that causes problems when using Zope or add AST transforms tailored to the zope project.
    
    At the same time, --include-ids and --symbols will also be removed in Pylint 1.6.
    
    Closes \#570.

  - missing-module-attribute was removed and the corresponding CLI option, required-attributes, which is slated for removal in Pylint 1.6.

  - missing-reversed-argument was removed.
    
    The reason behind this is that this kind of errors should be detected by the type checker for *all* the builtins and not as a special case for the reversed builtin. This will happen shortly in the future.

  - \--comment flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

  - \--profile flag is obsolete and it will be removed in Pylint 1.6.

  - Add a new error, 'misplaced-bare-raise'.
    
    The error is used when a bare raise is not used inside an except clause. This can generate a RuntimeError in Python, if there are no active exceptions to be reraised. While it works in Python 2 due to the fact that the exception leaks outside of the except block, it's nevertheless a behaviour that a user shouldn't depend upon, since it's not obvious to the reader of the code what exception will be raised and it will not be compatible with Python 3 anyhow.
    
    Closes \#633.

  - Bring logilab-common's ureports into pylint.reporters.
    
    With this change, we moved away from depending on logilab-common, having in Pylint all the components that were used from logilab-common. The API should be considered an implementation detail and can change at some point in the future.
    
    Closes \#621.

  - `reimported` is emitted for reimported objects on the same line.
    
    Closes \#639.

  - Abbreviations of command line options are not supported anymore.
    
    Using abbreviations for CLI options was never considered to be a feature of pylint, this fact being only a side effect of using optparse. As this was the case, using --load-plugin or other abbreviation for --load-plugins never actually worked, while it also didn't raise an error.
    
    Closes \#424.

  - Add a new error, 'nonlocal-without-binding'
    
    The error is emitted on Python 3 when a nonlocal name is not bound to any variable in the parents scopes.
    
    Closes \#582.

  -   - 'deprecated-module' can be shown for modules which aren't  
        available.
    
    Closes \#362.

  - Don't consider a class abstract if its members can't be properly inferred.
    
    This fixes a false positive related to abstract-class-instantiated.
    
    Closes \#648.

  - Add a new checker for the async features added by PEP 492.

  - Add a new error, 'yield-inside-async-function', emitted on Python 3.5 and upwards when the `yield` statement is found inside a new coroutine function (PEP 492).

  - Add a new error, 'not-async-context-manager', emitted when an async context manager block is used with an object which doesn't support this protocol (PEP 492).

  - Add a new convention warning, 'singleton-comparison', emitted when comparison to True, False or None is found.

  - Don't emit 'assigning-non-slot' for descriptors.
    
    Closes \#652.

  - Add a new error, 'repeated-keyword', when a keyword argument is passed multiple times into a function call.
    
    This is similar with redundant-keyword-arg, but it's mildly different that it needs to be a separate error.

  - \--enable=all can now be used.
    
    Closes \#142.

  - Add a new convention message, 'misplaced-comparison-constant', emitted when a constant is placed in the left hand side of a comparison, as in '5 == func()'. This is also called Yoda condition, since the flow of code reminds of the Star Wars green character, conditions usually encountered in languages with variabile assignments in conditional statements.

  - Add a new convention message, 'consider-using-enumerate', which is emitted when code that uses `range` and `len` for iterating is encountered.
    
    Closes \#684.

  - Added two new refactoring messages, 'no-classmethod-decorator' and 'no-staticmethod-decorator', which are emitted when a static method or a class method is declared without using decorators syntax.
    
    Closes \#675.

# What's New In Pylint 1.6

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

Ticket numbers can be internal to logilab or come from bitbucket.

- Release  
    1.6.0

  - Date  
    2016-07-07

# Summary -- Release highlights

Nothing major.

# New checkers

  - We added a new recommendation check, `consider-iterating-dictionary`, which is emitted when a dictionary is iterated by using `.keys()`.
    
    For instance, the following code would trigger this warning, since the dictionary's keys can be iterated without calling the method explicitly.
    
      - \`\`\`python
        
          - for key in dictionary.keys():  
            ...
        
        \# Can be refactored to: for key in dictionary: ...

  - `trailing-newlines` check was added, which is emitted when a file has trailing newlines.

  - `invalid-length-returned` check was added, which is emitted when the `__len__` special method returns something else than a non-negative number. For instance, this example is triggering it:
    
        class Container(object):
            def __len__(self):
                return self._items # Oups, forgot to call len() over it.

  - Add a new check to the *check\_docs* extension for looking for duplicate constructor parameters in a class constructor docstring or in a class docstring.
    
    The check `multiple-constructor-doc` is emitted when the parameter is documented in both places.

  - We added a new extension plugin, `pylint.extensions.mccabe`, which can be used for warning about the complexity in the code.
    
    You can enable it as in:
    
        $ pylint module_or_project --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe
    
    See more at \[pylint.extensions.mccabe\](\#pylint.extensions.mccabe)

New features `` ` ============  * ``generated-members`now supports qualified names through regular expressions.    For instance, for ignoring all the errors generated by`numpy.core`'s attributes, we can   now use::        $ pylint a.py --generated-members=numpy.*   * Add the ability to ignore files based on regex matching, with the new`--ignore-patterns`option.    Rather than clobber the existing`ignore`option, we decided to have a separate   option for it. For instance, for ignoring all the test files, we can now use::        $ pylint myproject --ignore-patterns=test.*?py   * We added a new option,`redefining-builtins-modules`, which is used for   defining the modules which can redefine builtins.   *pylint* will emit an error when a builtin is redefined, such as defining   a variable called`next`. But in some cases, the builtins can be   redefined in the case they are imported from other places, different   than the`builtins`module, such is the case for`six.moves`, which   contains more forward-looking functions::        $ cat a.py       # Oups, now pylint emits a redefined-builtin message.       from six.moves import open       $ pylint a.py --redefining-builtins-modules=six.moves    Default values:`six.moves,future.builtins`Bug fixes =========  * Fixed a bug where the top name of a qualified import was detected as an unused variable.  * We don't warn about`invalid-sequence-index`if the indexed object has unknown   base classes, that Pylint cannot deduce.    Other Changes =============   * The`bad-builtin`check was moved into an extension.    The check was complaining about used builtin functions which   were supposed to not be used. For instance,`map`and`filter`were falling into this category, since better alternatives can   be used, such as list comprehensions. But the check was annoying,   since using`map`or`filter`can have its use cases and as   such, we decided to move it to an extension check instead.   It can now be enabled through`--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.bad\_builtin`.  * We use the`configparser`backport internally, for Python 2.    This allows having comments inside list values, in the configuration,   such as::        disable=no-member,               # Don't like this check               bad-indentation  * We now use the isort_ package internally.    This improves the`<span class="title-ref">wrong-import-order</span>\` check, so now we should have less false positives regarding the import order.

  - We do not emit `import-error` or `no-name-in-module` for fallback import blocks by default.
    
    A fallback import block can be considered a TryExcept block, which contains imports in both branches, such as:
    
        try:
            import urllib.request as request
        except ImportError:
            import urllib2 as request
    
    In the case where **pylint** can not find one import from the `except` branch, then it will emit an `import-error`, but this gets cumbersome when trying to write compatible code for both Python versions. As such, we don't check these blocks by default, but the analysis can be enforced by using the new `--analyse-fallback-block` flag.

  - `reimported` is emitted when the same name is imported from different module, as in:
    
        from collections import deque, OrderedDict, deque

# Deprecated features

  - The HTML support was deprecated and will be eventually removed in Pylint 1.7.0.
    
    This feature was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being often neglected and having a couple of bugs. Since we now have the JSON reporter, this can be used as a basis for more prettier HTML outputs than what Pylint can currently offer.

  - The `--files-output` option was deprecated and will be eventually removed in Pylint 1.7.0.

  - The `--optimize-ast` option was deprecated and will be eventually removed in Pylint 1.7.0.
    
    The option was initially added for handling pathological cases, such as joining too many strings using the addition operator, which was leading pylint to have a recursion error when trying to figure out what the string was. Unfortunately, we decided to ignore the issue, since the pathological case would have happen when the code was parsed by Python as well, without actually reaching the runtime step and as such, we will remove the option in the future.

  - The `check_docs` extension is now deprecated. The extension is still available under the `docparams` name, so this should work:
    
        $ pylint module_or_package --load-extensions=pylint.extensions.docparams
    
    The old name is still kept for backward compatibility, but it will be eventually removed.

# Full changelog

## What's New in Pylint 1.7.1?

Release date: 2017-04-17

  - Fix a false positive which occurred when an exception was reraised
    
    Closes \#1419

  - Fix a false positive of `disallow-trailing-tuple`
    
    The check was improved by verifying for non-terminating newlines, which should exempt function calls and function definitions from the check
    
    Closes \#1424

## What's New in Pylint 1.7?

Release date: 2017-04-13

  - Don't emit missing-final-newline or trailing-whitespace for formfeeds (page breaks).
    
    Closes \#1218 and \#1219

  - Don't emit by default no-member if we have opaque inference objects in the inference results
    
    This is controlled through the new flag ignore-on-opaque-inference, which is by default True. The inference can return multiple potential results while evaluating a Python object, but some branches might not be evaluated, which results in partial inference. In that case, it might be useful to still emit no-member and other checks for the rest of the inferred objects.

  - Added new message `assign-to-new-keyword` to warn about assigning to names which will become a keyword in future Python releases.
    
    Closes \#1351

  - Split the 'missing or differing' in parameter documentation in different error. 'differing-param-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-param-doc', and 'differing-type-doc' covers the differing part of the old 'missing-type-doc'
    
    Closes \#1342

  - Added a new error, 'used-prior-global-declaration', which is emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration in a function. This causes a SyntaxError in Python 3.6
    
    Closes \#1257

  - The protocol checks are emitting their messages when a special method is set to None.
    
    Closes \#1263

  - Properly detect if imported name is assigned to same name in different scope.
    
    Closes \#636, \#848, \#851, and \#900

  - Require one space for annotations with type hints, as per PEP 8.

  - 'trailing-comma-tuple' check was added
    
    This message is emitted when pylint finds an one-element tuple, created by a stray comma. This can suggest a potential problem in the code and it is recommended to use parentheses in order to emphasise the creation of a tuple, rather than relying on the comma itself.

  - Don't emit not-callable for instances with unknown bases.
    
    Closes \#1213

  - Treat keyword only arguments the same as positional arguments with regard to unused-argument check

  - Don't try to access variables defined in a separate scope when checking for `protected-access`

  - Added new check to detect incorrect usage of len(SEQUENCE) inside test conditions.

  - Added new extension to detect comparisons against empty string constants

  - Added new extension to detect comparisons of integers against zero

  - Added new error conditions for 'bad-super-call'
    
    Now detects `super(type(self), self)` and `super(self.__class__, self)` which can lead to recursion loop in derived classes.

  - PyLinter.should\_analyze\_file has a new optional parameter, called `is_argument`
    
    Closes \#1079

  - Add attribute hints for missing members
    
    Closes \#1035

  - Add a new warning, 'redefined-argument-from-local'
    
    Closes \#649

  - Support inline comments for comma separated values in the config file
    
    Closes \#1024

  - epylint.py\_run's *script* parameter was removed.

  - epylint.py\_run now uses `shell=False` for running the underlying process.
    
    Closes \#441

  - Added a new warning, 'useless-super-delegation'
    
    Close 839.

  - Added a new error, 'invalid-metaclass', raised when we can detect that a class is using an improper metaclass.
    
    Closes \#579

  - Added a new refactoring message, 'literal-comparison'.
    
    Closes \#786

  - arguments-differ takes in consideration kwonlyargs and variadics
    
    Closes \#983

  - Removed --optimized-ast
    
    Fixes part of \#975

  - Removed --files-output option
    
    Fixes part of \#975

  - Removed pylint-gui from the package.

  - Removed the HTML reporter
    
    Fixes part of \#975

  - ignored-argument-names is now used for ignoring arguments for unused-variable check.
    
    This option was used for ignoring arguments when computing the correct number of arguments a function should have, but for handling the arguments with regard to unused-variable check, dummy-variables-rgx was used instead. Now, ignored-argument-names is used for its original purpose and also for ignoring the matched arguments for the unused-variable check. This offers a better control of what should be ignored and how. Also, the same option was moved from the design checker to the variables checker, which means that the option now appears under the `[VARIABLES]` section inside the configuration file.
    
    Closes \#862.

  - Fix a false positive for keyword variadics with regard to keyword only arguments.
    
    If a keyword only argument was necessary for a function, but that function was called with keyword variadics (\*\*kwargs), then we were emitting a missing-kwoa false positive, which is now fixed.
    
    Closes \#934.

  - Fix some false positives with unknown sized variadics.
    
    Closes \#878

  - Added a new extension, check\_docstring, for checking PEP 257 conventions.
    
    Closes \#868.

  - config files with BOM markers can now be read.
    
    Closes \#864.

  - epylint.py\_run does not crash on big files, using .communicate() instead of .wait()
    
    Closes \#599

  - Disable reports by default and show the evaluation score by default
    
    The reports were disabled by default in order to simplify the interaction between the tool and the users. The score is still shown by default, as a way of closely measuring when it increases or decreases due to changes brought to the code.
    
    Refs \#746

  - Disable the information category messages by default. This is a step towards making pylint more sane.
    
    Refs \#746.

  - Catch more cases as not proper iterables for \_\_slots\_\_ with regard to invalid-slots pattern.
    
    Closes \#775

  - empty indent strings are rejected.

  - Added a new error, 'relative-beyond-top-level', which is emitted when a relative import was attempted beyond the top level package.
    
    Closes \#588

  - Added a new warning, 'unsupported-assignment-operation', which is emitted when item assignment is tried on an object which doesn't have this ability.
    
    Closes \#591

  - Added a new warning, 'unsupported-delete-operation', which is emitted when item deletion is tried on an object which doesn't have this ability.
    
    Closes \#592

  - Fix a false positive of 'redundant-returns-doc', occurred when the documented function was using *yield* instead of *return*.
    
    Closes \#984.

  - Fix false positives of 'missing-\[raisestype\]-doc' due to not recognizing keyword synonyms supported by Sphinx.

  - Added a new refactoring message, 'consider-merging-isinstance', which is emitted whenever we can detect that consecutive isinstance calls can be merged together.
    
    Closes \#968

  - Fix a false positive of 'missing-param-doc' and 'missing-type-doc', occurred when a class docstring uses the 'For the parameters, see' magic string but the class \_\_init\_\_ docstring does not, or vice versa.

  - `redefined-outer-name` is now also emitted when a nested loop's target variable is the same as a target variable in an outer loop.
    
    Closes \#911.

  - Added proper exception type inference for 'missing-raises-doc'.

  - Added InvalidMessageError exception class to replace asserts in pylint.utils.

  - More thorough validation in MessagesStore.register\_messages() to avoid one message accidentally overwriting another.

  - InvalidMessageError, UnknownMessage, and EmptyReport exceptions are moved to the new pylint.exceptions submodule.

  - UnknownMessage and EmptyReport are renamed to UnknownMessageError and EmptyReportError.

  - Warnings 'missing-returns-type-doc' and 'missing-yields-type-doc' have each been split into two warnings - 'missing-\[returnyield\]-type-doc'.

  - Added epytext support to docparams extension.
    
    Closes \#1029

  - Support having plugins with the same name and with options defined
    
    Closes \#1018

  - Sort configuration options in a section
    
    Closes \#1087

  - Added a new Python 3 warning around implementing '\_\_div\_\_', '\_\_idiv\_\_', or '\_\_rdiv\_\_' as those methods are phased out in Python 3.

  - Added a new warning, 'overlapping-except', which is emitted when two exceptions in the same except-clause are aliases for each other or one exceptions is an ancestor of another.

  - Avoid crashing on ill-formatted strings when checking for string formatting errors.

  - Added a new Python 3 warning for calling 'str.encode' or 'str.decode' with a non-text encoding.

  - Added new coding convention message, 'single-string-used-for-slots'.
    
    Closes \#1166

  - Added a new Python 3 check for accessing 'sys.maxint' which was removed in Python 3 in favor of 'sys.maxsize'

  - Added a new Python 3 check for bad imports.

  - Added a new Python 3 check for accessing deprecated string functions.

  - Do not warn about unused arguments or function being redefined in singledispatch registered implementations.
    
    Closes \#1032 and \#1034

  - Added refactoring message 'no-else-return'.

  - Improve unused-variable checker to warn about unused variables in module scope.
    
    Closes \#919

  - Ignore modules import as \_ when checking for unused imports.
    
    Closes \#1190

  - Improve handing of Python 3 classes with metaclasses declared in nested scopes.
    
    Closes \#1177

  - Added refactoring message 'consider-using-ternary'.
    
    Closes \#1204

  - Bug-fix for false-positive logging-format-interpolation\` when format specifications are used in formatted string.

    Closes \#738

  - Protected access in form `type(self)._attribute` are now allowed.
    
    Closes \#1031

  - Let the user modify msg-template when Pylint is called from a Python script
    
    Closes \#1269

  - Imports checker supports new switch `allow-wildcard-with-all` which disables warning on wildcard import when imported module defines `__all__` variable.
    
    Closes \#831

  - `too-many-format-args` and `too-few-format-args` are emitted correctly when starred expression are used in RHS tuple.
    
    Closes \#957

  - `cyclic-import` checker supports local disable clauses. When one of cycle imports was done in scope where disable clause was active, cycle is not reported as violation.

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

- Release  
    1.7

  - Date  
    2017-04-13

# Summary -- Release highlights

# New checkers

  - `single-string-used-for-slots` check was added, which is used whenever a class is using a single string as a slot value. While this is technically not a problem per se, it might trip users when manipulating the slots value as an iterable, which would in turn iterate over characters of the slot value. In order to be more straight-forward, always try to use a container such as a list or a tuple for defining slot values.

  - We added a new check, `literal-comparison`, which is used whenever **pylint** can detect a comparison to a literal. This is usually not what we want and, potentially, error prone. For instance, in the given example, the first string comparison returns true, since smaller strings are interned by the interpreter, while for larger ones, it will return False:
    
    `` `python      mystring = "ok"      if mystring is "ok": # Returns true         ...       mystring = "a" * 1000      if mystring is ("a" * 1000): # This will return False         ...  Instead of using the ``is`operator, you should use the`==\`\` operator for this use case.

  - We added a new refactoring message, `consider-merging-isinstance`, which is emitted whenever we can detect that consecutive *isinstance* calls can be merged together. For instance, in this example, we can merge the first two *isinstance* calls:
    
    ``` python
    # $ cat a.py
    if isinstance(x, int) or isinstance(x, float):
        pass
    if isinstance(x, (int, float)) or isinstance(x, str):
        pass
    # $ pylint a.py
    # R:  1, 0: Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(x, (float, int)) (consider-merging-isinstance)
    # R:  3, 0: Consider merging these isinstance calls to isinstance(x, (int, float, str)) (consider-merging-isinstance)
    ```

  - A new error check was added, `invalid-metaclass`, which is used whenever *pylint* can detect that a given class is using a metaclass which is invalid for the purpose of the class. This usually might indicate a problem in the code, rather than something done on purpose.
    
    ``` python
    # Needs to inherit from *type* in order to be valid
    class SomeClass(object):
        ...
    
    class MyClass(metaclass=SomeClass):
        pass
    ```

  - A new warning was added, `useless-super-delegation`, which is used whenever we can detect that an overridden method is useless, relying on *super()* delegation to do the same thing as another method from the MRO.
    
    For instance, in this example, the first two methods are useless, since they do the exact same thing as the methods from the base classes, while the next two methods are not, since they do some extra operations with the passed arguments.
    
    ``` python
    class Impl(Base):
    
        def __init__(self, param1, param2):
            super(Impl, self).__init__(param1, param2)
    
        def useless(self, first, second):
            return super(Impl, self).useless(first, second)
    
        def not_useless(self, first, **kwargs):
            debug = kwargs.pop('debug', False)
            if debug:
                ...
            return super(Impl, self).not_useless(first, **kwargs)
    
        def not_useless_1(self, first, *args):
            return super(Impl, self).not_useless_1(first + some_value, *args)
    ```

  - A new warning was added, `len-as-condition`, which is used whenever we detect that a condition uses `len(SEQUENCE)` incorrectly. Instead one could use `if SEQUENCE` or `if not SEQUENCE`.
    
    For instance, all of the examples below:
    
    ``` python
    if len(S):
      pass
    
    if not len(S):
      pass
    
    if len(S) > 0:
      pass
    
    if len(S) != 0:
      pass
    
    if len(S) == 0:
      pass
    ```
    
    can be written in a more natural way:
    
    ``` python
    if S:
      pass
    
    if not S:
      pass
    ```
    
    See <https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#programming-recommendations> for more information.

  - A new extension was added, `emptystring.py` which detects whenever we detect comparisons to empty string constants. This extension is disabled by default. For instance, the examples below:
    
    ``` python
    if S != "":
      pass
    
    if S == '':
      pass
    ```
    
    can be written in a more natural way:
    
    ``` python
    if S:
      pass
    
    if not S:
      pass
    ```
    
    An exception to this is when empty string is an allowed value whose meaning is treated differently than `None`. For example the meaning could be user selected no additional options vs. user has not made their selection yet\!
    
    You can activate this checker by adding the line:
    
        load-plugins=pylint.extensions.emptystring
    
    to the `MAIN` section of your `.pylintrc` or using the command:
    
        $ pylint a.py --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.emptystring

  - A new extension was added, `comparetozero.py` which detects whenever we compare integers to zero. This extension is disabled by default. For instance, the examples below:
    
    ``` python
    if X != 0:
      pass
    
    if X == 0:
      pass
    ```
    
    can be written in a more natural way:
    
    ``` python
    if X:
      pass
    
    if not X:
      pass
    ```
    
    An exception to this is when zero is an allowed value whose meaning is treated differently than `None`. For example the meaning could be `None` means no limit, while `0` means the limit it zero\!
    
    You can activate this checker by adding the line:
    
        load-plugins=pylint.extensions.comparetozero
    
    to the `MAIN` section of your `.pylintrc` or using the command:
    
        $ pylint a.py --load-plugins=pylint.extensions.comparetozero

  - We've added new error conditions for `bad-super-call` which now detect the usage of `super(type(self), self)` and `super(self.__class__, self)` patterns. These can lead to recursion loop in derived classes. The problem is visible only if you override a class that uses these incorrect invocations of `super()`.
    
    For instance, `Derived.__init__()` will correctly call `Base.__init__`. At this point `type(self)` will be equal to `Derived` and the call again goes to `Base.__init__` and we enter a recursion loop.
    
    ``` python
    class Base(object):
        def __init__(self, param1, param2):
            super(type(self), self).__init__(param1, param2)
    
    class Derived(Base):
        def __init__(self, param1, param2):
            super(Derived, self).__init__(param1, param2)
    ```

  - The warnings `missing-returns-doc` and `missing-yields-doc` have each been replaced with two new warnings - `missing-[return|yield]-doc` and `missing-[return|yield]-type-doc`. Having these as separate warnings allows the user to choose whether their documentation style requires text descriptions of function return/yield, specification of return/yield types, or both.
    
    ``` python
    # This will raise missing-return-type-doc but not missing-return-doc
    def my_sphinx_style_func(self):
        """This is a Sphinx-style docstring.
    
        :returns: Always False
        """
        return False
    
    # This will raise missing-return-doc but not missing-return-type-doc
    def my_google_style_func(self):
        """This is a Google-style docstring.
    
        Returns:
            bool:
        """
        return False
    ```

  - A new refactoring check was added, `redefined-argument-from-local`, which is emitted when **pylint** can detect than a function argument is redefined locally in some potential error prone cases. For instance, in the following piece of code, we have a bug, since the check will never return `True`, given the fact that we are comparing the same object to its attributes.
    
    ``` python
    def test(resource):
        for resource in resources:
            # The ``for`` is reusing ``resource``, which means that the following
            # ``resource`` is not what we wanted to check against.
            if resource.resource_type == resource:
               call_resource(resource)
    ```
    
    Other places where this check looks are *with* statement name bindings and except handler's name binding.

  - A new refactoring check was added, `no-else-return`, which is emitted when pylint encounters an else following a chain of ifs, all of them containing a return statement.
    
    ``` python
    def foo1(x, y, z):
        if x:
            return y
        else:  # This is unnecessary here.
            return z
    ```
    
    We could fix it deleting the `else` statement.
    
    ``` python
    def foo1(x, y, z):
        if x:
            return y
        return z
    ```

  - A new Python 3 check was added, `eq-without-hash`, which enforces classes that implement `__eq__` *also* implement `__hash__`. The behavior around classes which implement `__eq__` but not `__hash__` changed in Python 3; in Python 2 such classes would get `object.__hash__` as their default implementation. In Python 3, aforementioned classes get `None` as their implementation thus making them unhashable.
    
    ``` python
    class JustEq(object):
       def __init__(self, x):
         self.x = x
    
       def __eq__(self, other):
         return self.x == other.x
    
    class Neither(object):
      def __init__(self, x):
        self.x = x
    
    class HashAndEq(object):
       def __init__(self, x):
         self.x = x
    
       def __eq__(self, other):
         return self.x == other.x
    
       def __hash__(self):
         return hash(self.x)
    
    {Neither(1), Neither(2)}  # OK in Python 2 and Python 3
    {HashAndEq(1), HashAndEq(2)}  # OK in Python 2 and Python 3
    {JustEq(1), JustEq(2)}  # Works in Python 2, throws in Python 3
    ```
    
    In general, this is a poor practice which motivated the behavior change.
    
    ``` python
    as_set = {JustEq(1), JustEq(2)}
    print(JustEq(1) in as_set)  # prints False
    print(JustEq(1) in list(as_set))  # prints True
    ```
    
    In order to fix this error and avoid behavior differences between Python 2 and Python 3, classes should either explicitly set `__hash__` to `None` or implement a hashing function.
    
    ``` python
    class JustEq(object):
       def __init__(self, x):
         self.x = x
    
       def __eq__(self, other):
         return self.x == other.x
    
       __hash__ = None
    
    {JustEq(1), JustEq(2)}  # Now throws an exception in both Python 2 and Python 3.
    ```

  - 3 new Python 3 checkers were added, `div-method`, `idiv-method` and `rdiv-method`. The magic methods `__div__` and `__idiv__` have been phased out in Python 3 in favor of `__truediv__`. Classes implementing `__div__` that still need to be used from Python 2 code not using `from __future__ import division` should implement `__truediv__` and alias `__div__` to that implementation.
    
    ``` python
    from __future__ import division
    
    class DivisibleThing(object):
       def __init__(self, x):
         self.x = x
    
       def __truediv__(self, other):
         return DivisibleThing(self.x / other.x)
    
       __div__ = __truediv__
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing the `message` attribute on Exceptions. The message attribute was deprecated in Python 2.7 and was removed in Python 3. See <https://peps.python.org/pep-0352/#retracted-ideas> for more information.
    
    ``` python
    try:
      raise Exception("Oh No!!")
    except Exception as e:
      print(e.message)
    ```
    
    Instead of relying on the `message` attribute, you should explicitly cast the exception to a string:
    
    ``` python
    try:
      raise Exception("Oh No!!")
    except Exception as e:
      print(str(e))
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about using `encode` or `decode` on strings with non-text codecs. This check also checks calls to `open` with the keyword argument `encoding`. See <https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.4.html#improvements-to-codec-handling> for more information.
    
    ``` python
    'hello world'.encode('hex')
    ```
    
    Instead of using the `encode` method for non-text codecs use the `codecs` module.
    
    ``` python
    import codecs
    codecs.encode('hello world', 'hex')
    ```

  - A new warning was added, `overlapping-except`, which is emitted when an except handler treats two exceptions which are *overlapping*. This means that one exception is an ancestor of the other one or it is just an alias.
    
    For example, in Python 3.3+, IOError is an alias for OSError. In addition, socket.error is an alias for OSError. The intention is to find cases like the following:
    
    ``` python
    import socket
    try:
        pass
    except (ConnectionError, IOError, OSError, socket.error):
        pass
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing `sys.maxint`. This attribute was removed in Python 3 in favor of `sys.maxsize`.
    
    ``` python
    import sys
    print(sys.maxint)
    ```
    
    Instead of using `sys.maxint`, use `sys.maxsize`
    
    ``` python
    import sys
    print(sys.maxsize)
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about importing modules that have either moved or been removed from the standard library.
    
    One of the major undertakings with Python 3 was a reorganization of the standard library to remove old or supplanted modules and reorganize some of the existing modules. As a result, roughly 100 modules that exist in Python 2 no longer exist in Python 3. See <https://peps.python.org/pep-3108/> and <https://peps.python.org/pep-0004/> for more information. There were suggestions on how to handle this, at pythonhosted.org/six/\#module-six.moves (dead link) or python3porting.com/stdlib.html (dead link).
    
    ``` python
    from cStringIO import StringIO
    ```
    
    Instead of directly importing the deprecated module, either use `six.moves` or a conditional import.
    
    ``` python
    from six.moves import cStringIO as StringIO
    
    if sys.version_info[0] >= 3:
        from io import StringIO
    else:
        from cStringIO import StringIO
    ```
    
    This checker will assume any imports that happen within a conditional or a `try/except` block are valid.

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing deprecated functions on the string module. Python 3 removed functions that were duplicated from the builtin `str` class. See <https://docs.python.org/2/library/string.html#deprecated-string-functions> for more information.
    
    ``` python
    import string
    print(string.upper('hello world!'))
    ```
    
    Instead of using `string.upper`, call the `upper` method directly on the string object.
    
    ``` python
    "hello world!".upper()
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about calling `str.translate` with the removed `deletechars` parameter. `str.translate` is frequently used as a way to remove characters from a string.
    
    ``` python
    'hello world'.translate(None, 'low')
    ```
    
    Unfortunately, there is not an idiomatic way of writing this call in a 2and3 compatible way. If this code is not in the critical path for your application and the use of `translate` was a premature optimization, consider using `re.sub` instead:
    
    ``` python
    import re
    chars_to_remove = re.compile('[low]')
    chars_to_remove.sub('', 'hello world')
    ```
    
    If this code is in your critical path and must be as fast as possible, consider declaring a helper method that varies based upon Python version.
    
    ``` python
    if six.PY3:
        def _remove_characters(text, deletechars):
            return text.translate({ord(x): None for x in deletechars})
    else:
        def _remove_characters(text, deletechars):
            return text.translate(None, deletechars)
    ```

  - A new refactoring check was added, `consider-using-ternary`, which is emitted when pylint encounters constructs which were used to emulate ternary statement before it was introduced in Python 2.5.
    
    ``` python
    value = condition and truth_value or false_value
    ```
    
    Warning can be fixed by using standard ternary construct:
    
    ``` python
    value = truth_value if condition else false_value
    ```

  - A new refactoring check was added, `trailing-comma-tuple`, which is emitted when pylint finds an one-element tuple, created by a stray comma. This can suggest a potential problem in the code and it is recommended to use parentheses in order to emphasise the creation of a tuple, rather than relying on the comma itself.
    
    The warning is emitted for such a construct:
    
    ``` python
    a = 1,
    ```
    
    The warning can be fixed by adding parentheses:
    
    ``` python
    a = (1, )
    ```

  - Two new check were added for detecting an unsupported operation over an instance, `unsupported-assignment-operation` and `unsupported-delete-operation`. The first one is emitted whenever an object does not support item assignment, while the second is emitted when an object does not support item deletion:
    
    ``` python
    class A:
        pass
    instance = A()
    instance[4] = 4 # unsupported-assignment-operation
    del instance[4] # unsupported-delete-operation
    ```

  - A new check was added, `relative-beyond-top-level`, which is emitted when a relative import tries to access too many levels in the current package.

  - A new check was added, `trailing-newlines`, which is emitted when a file has trailing new lines.

  - `invalid-length-returned` check was added, which is emitted when a `__len__` implementation does not return a non-negative integer.

  - There is a new extension, `pylint.extensions.mccabe`, which can be used for computing the McCabe complexity of classes and functions.
    
    You can enable this extension through `--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.mccabe`

  - A new check was added, `used-prior-global-declaration`. This is emitted when a name is used prior a global declaration, resulting in a SyntaxError in Python 3.6.

  - A new message was added, `assign-to-new-keyword`. This is emitted when used name is known to become a keyword in future Python release. Assignments to keywords would result in `SyntaxError` after switching to newer interpreter version.
    
    ``` python
    # While it's correct in Python 2.x, it raises a SyntaxError in Python 3.x
    True = 1
    False = 0
    
    # Same as above, but it'll be a SyntaxError starting from Python 3.7
    async = "async"
    await = "await"
    ```

Other Changes `` ` =============  * We don't emit by default ``no-member`if we have opaque inference objects in the inference results    This is controlled through the new flag`--ignore-on-opaque-inference`, which is by   default True. The inference can return  multiple potential results while   evaluating a Python object, but some branches might not be evaluated, which   results in partial inference. In that case, it might be useful to still emit   no-member and other checks for the rest of the inferred objects.  * Namespace packages are now supported by pylint. This includes both explicit namespace   packages and implicit namespace packages, supported in Python 3 through PEP 420.  * A new option was added,`--analyse-fallback-block`.    This can be used to support both Python 2 and 3 compatible import block code,   which means that the import block might have code that exists only in one or another   interpreter, leading to false positives when analysed. By default, this is false, you   can enable the analysis for both branches using this flag.  *`ignored-argument-names`option is now used for ignoring arguments   for unused-variable check.    This option was used for ignoring arguments when computing the correct number of arguments   a function should have, but for handling the arguments with regard   to unused-variable check, dummy-variables-rgx was used instead. Now, ignored-argument-names   is used for its original purpose and also for ignoring the matched arguments for   the unused-variable check. This offers a better control of what should be ignored   and how.   Also, the same option was moved from the design checker to the variables checker,   which means that the option now appears under the`\[VARIABLES\]`section inside   the configuration file.  * A new option was added,`redefining-builtins-modules`, for controlling the modules   which can redefine builtins, such as six.moves and future.builtins.  * A new option was added,`ignore-patterns`, which is used for building a   ignore list of directories and files matching the regex patterns, similar to the`ignore`option.   * The reports are now disabled by default, as well as the information category   warnings.  *`arguments-differ`check was rewritten to take in consideration   keyword only parameters and variadics.    Now it also complains about losing or adding capabilities to a method,   by introducing positional or keyword variadics. For instance, *pylint*   now complains about these cases:`\`python class Parent(object):

>   - def foo(self, first, second):  
>     ...
> 
>   - def bar(self, \*\*kwargs):  
>     ...
> 
>   - def baz(self, \*, first):  
>     ...
> 
> class Child(Parent):
> 
> \# Why subclassing in the first place? def foo(self, *args,kwargs): \# mutate args or kwargs. super(Child, self).foo(*args, \*\*kwargs)
> 
>   - def bar(self, first=None, second=None, \*\*kwargs):  
>     ... \# The overridden method adds two new parameters, \# which can also be passed as positional arguments, \# breaking the contract of the parent's method.
> 
>   - def baz(self, first):  
>     ... \# Not keyword-only

  - `redefined-outer-name` is now also emitted when a nested loop's target variable is the same as an outer loop.
    
    ``` python
    for i, j in [(1, 2), (3, 4)]:
        for j in range(i):
            print(j)
    ```

  - relax character limit for method and function names that starts with `_`. This will let people to use longer descriptive names for methods and functions with a shorter scope (considered as private). The same idea applies to variable names, only with an inverse rule: you want long descriptive names for variables with bigger scope, like globals.

  - Add `InvalidMessageError` exception class and replace `assert` in pylint.utils with `raise InvalidMessageError`.

  - `UnknownMessageError` (formerly `UnknownMessage`) and `EmptyReportError` (formerly `EmptyReport`) are now provided by the new `pylint.exceptions` submodule instead of `pylint.utils` as before.

  - We now support inline comments for comma separated values in the configurations
    
    For instance, you can now use the **\#** sign for having comments inside comma separated values, as seen below:
    
        disable=no-member, # Don't care about it for now
                bad-indentation, # No need for this
                import-error
    
    Of course, interweaving comments with values is also working:
    
        disable=no-member,
                # Don't care about it for now
                bad-indentation # No need for this
    
    This works by setting the [inline comment prefixes](https://docs.python.org/3/library/configparser.html#customizing-parser-behaviour) accordingly.

  - Added epytext docstring support to the docparams extension.

  - We added support for providing hints when not finding a missing member.
    
    For example, given the following code, it should be obvious that the programmer intended to use the `mail` attribute, rather than `email`.
    
    ``` python
    class Contribution:
        def __init__(self, name, email, date):
            self.name = name
            self.mail = mail
            self.date = date
    
    for c in contributions:
        print(c.email) # Oups
    ```
    
    **pylint** will now warn that there is a chance of having a typo, suggesting new names that could be used instead.
    
    ``` sh
    $ pylint a.py
    E: 8,10: Instance of 'Contribution' has no 'email' member; maybe 'mail'?
    ```
    
    The behaviour is controlled through the `--missing-member-hint` option. Other options that come with this change are `--missing-member-max-choices` for choosing the total number of choices that should be picked in this situation and `--missing-member-hint-distance`, which specifies a metric for computing the distance between the names (this is based on Levenshtein distance, which means the lower the number, the more pickier the algorithm will be).

  - `PyLinter.should_analyze_file` has a new parameter, `is_argument`, which specifies if the given path is a **pylint** argument or not.
    
    `should_analyze_file` is called whenever **pylint** tries to determine if a file should be analyzed, defaulting to files with the `.py` extension, but this function gets called only in the case where the said file is not passed as a command line argument to **pylint**. This usually means that pylint will analyze a file, even if that file has a different extension, as long as the file was explicitly passed at command line. Since `should_analyze_file` cannot be overridden to handle all the cases, the check for the provenience of files was moved into `should_analyze_file`. This means we now can write something similar with this example, for ignoring every file respecting the desired property, disregarding the provenience of the file, being it a file passed as CLI argument or part of a package.
    
    ``` python
    from pylint.lint import Run, PyLinter
    
    class CustomPyLinter(PyLinter):
    
         def should_analyze_file(self, modname, path, is_argument=False):
             if respect_condition(path):
                 return False
             return super().should_analyze_file(modname, path, is_argument=is_argument)

    class CustomRun(Run):
         LinterClass = CustomPyLinter
    
    CustomRun(sys.argv[1:])
    ```

  - Imports aliased with underscore are skipped when checking for unused imports.

  - `bad-builtin` and `redefined-variable-type` are now extensions, being disabled by default. They can be enabled through: `--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.redefined_variable_type,pylint.extensions.bad_builtin`
    
      - Imports checker supports new switch `allow-wildcard-with-all` which disables warning on wildcard import when imported module defines `__all__` variable.

  - `differing-param-doc` is now used for the differing part of the old `missing-param-doc`, and `differing-type-doc` for the differing part of the old `missing-type-doc`.

Bug fixes `` ` =========  * Fix a false positive of ``redundant-returns-doc`, occurred when the documented   function was using *yield* instead of *return*.  * Fix a false positive of`missing-param-doc`and`missing-type-doc`,   occurred when a class docstring uses the`For the parameters, see`magic string but the class`\_\_init\_\_`docstring does not, or vice versa.  * Added proper exception type inference for`missing-raises-doc`. Now:`\`python def my\_func(): """"My function.""" ex = ValueError('foo') raise ex

> will properly be flagged for missing documentation of `:raises ValueError:` instead of `:raises ex:`, among other scenarios.

  - Fix false positives of `missing-[raises|params|type]-doc` due to not recognizing valid keyword synonyms supported by Sphinx.

  - More thorough validation in `MessagesStore.register_messages()` to detect conflicts between a new message and any existing message id, symbol, or `old_names`.

  - We now support having plugins that shares the same name and with each one providing options.
    
    A plugin can be logically split into multiple classes, each class providing certain capabilities, all of them being tied under the same name. But when two or more such classes are also adding options, then **pylint** crashed, since it already added the first encountered section. Now, these should work as expected.
    
    ``` python
    from pylint.checkers import BaseChecker

    class DummyPlugin1(BaseChecker):
        name = 'dummy_plugin'
        msgs = {'I9061': ('Dummy short desc 01', 'dummy-message-01', 'Dummy long desc')}
        options = (
            ('dummy_option_1', {
                'type': 'string',
                'metavar': '<string>',
                'help': 'Dummy option 1',
            }),
        )

    class DummyPlugin2(BaseChecker):
        name = 'dummy_plugin'
        msgs = {'I9060': ('Dummy short desc 02', 'dummy-message-02', 'Dummy long desc')}
        options = (
            ('dummy_option_2', {
                'type': 'string',
                'metavar': '<string>',
                'help': 'Dummy option 2',
            }),
        )

    def register(linter):
        linter.register_checker(DummyPlugin1(linter))
        linter.register_checker(DummyPlugin2(linter))
    ```

  - We do not yield `unused-argument` for singledispatch implementations and do not warn about `function-redefined` for multiple implementations with same name.
    
    ``` python
    from functools import singledispatch
    
    @singledispatch
    def f(x):
        return 2*x
    
    @f.register(str)
    def _(x):
        return -1
    
    @f.register(int)
    @f.register(float)
    def _(x):
        return -x
    ```

  - `unused-variable` checker has new functionality of warning about unused variables in global module namespace. Since globals in module namespace may be a part of exposed API, this check is disabled by default. For enabling it, set `allow-global-unused-variables` option to false.

  - Fix a false-positive `logging-format-interpolation` message, when format specifications are used in formatted string. In general, these operations are not always convertible to old-style formatting used by logging module.

  - Added a new switch `single-line-class-stmt` to allow single-line declaration of empty class bodies (as seen in the example below). Pylint won't emit a `multiple-statements` message when this option is enabled.
    
    ``` python
    class MyError(Exception): pass
    ```
    
      - `too-many-format-args` and `too-few-format-args` are emitted correctly (or not emitted at all, when exact count of elements in RHS cannot be inferred) when starred expressions are used in RHS tuple. For example, code block as shown below detects correctly that the used tuple has in fact three elements, not two.
    
    <!-- end list -->
    
    ``` python
    meat = ['spam', 'ham']
    print('%s%s%s' % ('eggs', *meat))
    ```

  - `cyclic-import` checker supports local disable clauses. When one of cycle imports was done in scope where disable clause was active, cycle is not reported as violation.

Removed Changes `` ` ===============  * ``pylint-gui`was removed, because it was deemed unfit for being included   in *pylint*. It had a couple of bugs and misfeatures, its usability was subpar   and since its development was neglected, we decided it is best to move on without it.   * The HTML reporter was removed, including the`--output-format=html`option.   It was lately a second class citizen in Pylint, being mostly neglected.   Since we now have the JSON reporter, it can be used as a basis for building   more prettier HTML reports than what Pylint can currently generate. This is   part of the effort of removing cruft from Pylint, by removing less used   features.  * The`--files-output`option was removed. While the same functionality cannot   be easily replicated, the JSON reporter, for instance, can be used as a basis   for generating the messages per each file.  *`--required-attributes`option was removed.  *`--ignore-iface-methods`option was removed.  * The`--optimize-ast`flag was removed.    The option was initially added for handling pathological cases,   such as joining too many strings using the addition operator, which   was leading pylint to have a recursion error when trying to figure   out what the string was. Unfortunately, we decided to ignore the   issue, since the pathological case would have happen when the   code was parsed by Python as well, without actually reaching the   runtime step and as such, we decided to remove the error altogether.  *`epylint.py\_run`'s *script* parameter was removed.    Now`epylint.py\_run`is always using the underlying`epylint.lint`method from the current interpreter. This avoids some issues when multiple   instances of **pylint** are installed, which means that`epylint.py\_run`might have ran a different`epylint\`\` script than what was intended.

# Full changelog

## What's New in Pylint 1.8.1?

Release date: 2017-12-15

  - Wrong version number in \_\_pkginfo\_\_.

## What's New in Pylint 1.8?

Release date: 2017-12-15

  - Respect disable=... in config file when running with --py3k.

  - New warning `shallow-copy-environ` added
    
    Shallow copy of os.environ doesn't work as people may expect. os.environ is not a dict object but rather a proxy object, so any changes made on copy may have unexpected effects on os.environ
    
    Instead of copy.copy(os.environ) method os.environ.copy() should be used.
    
    See <https://bugs.python.org/issue15373> for details.
    
    Closes \#1301

  - Do not display no-absolute-import warning multiple times per file.

  -   - `trailing-comma-tuple` refactor check now extends to assignment with  
        more than one element (such as lists)
    
    Closes \#1713

  - Fixing u'' string in superfluous-parens message
    
    Closes \#1420

  - `abstract-class-instantiated` is now emitted for all inference paths.
    
    Closes \#1673

  - Add set of predefined naming style to ease configuration of checking naming conventions.
    
    Closes \#1013

  - Added a new check, `keyword-arg-before-vararg`
    
    This is emitted for function definitions in which keyword arguments are placed before variable positional arguments (\*args).
    
    This may lead to args list getting modified if keyword argument's value is not provided in the function call assuming it will take default value provided in the definition.

  - The `invalid-name` check contains the name of the template that caused the failure
    
    Closes \#1176

  - Using the -j flag won't start more child linters than needed.
    
    Closes \#1614

  - Fix a false positive with bad-python3-import on relative imports
    
    Closes \#1608

  - Added a new Python 3 check, `non-ascii-bytes-literals`
    
    Closes \#1545

  - Added a couple of new Python 3 checks for accessing dict methods in non-iterable context

  - Protocol checks (not-a-mapping, not-an-iterable and co.) aren't emitted on classes with dynamic getattr

  - Added a new warning, 'bad-thread-instantiation'
    
    This message is emitted when the threading.Thread class does not receive the target argument, but receives just one argument, which is by default the group parameter.
    
    Closes \#1327

  - In non-quiet mode, absolute path of used config file is logged to standard error.
    
    Closes \#1519

  - Raise meaningful exception for invalid reporter class being selected
    
    When unknown reporter class will be selected as Pylint reporter, meaningful error message would be raised instead of bare `ImportError` or `AttributeError` related to module or reporter class being not found.
    
    Closes \#1388

  - Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed functions from itertools like `izip` or `ifilterfalse`

  - Added a new Python 3 check for accessing removed fields from the types module like `UnicodeType` or `XRangeType`

  - Added a new Python 3 check for declaring a method `next` that would have been treated as an iterator in Python 2 but a normal function in Python 3.

  - Added a new key-value pair in json output. The key is `message-id` and the value is the message id.
    
    Closes \#1512

  - Added a new Python 3.0 check for raising a StopIteration inside a generator. The check about raising a StopIteration inside a generator is also valid if the exception raised inherit from StopIteration.
    
    Closes \#1385

  - Added a new warning, `raising-format-tuple`, to detect multi-argument exception construction instead of message string formatting.

  - Added a new check for method of logging module that concatenate string via + operator
    
    Closes \#1479

  - Added parameter for limiting number of suggestions in spellchecking checkers

  - Fix a corner-case in `consider-using-ternary` checker.
    
    When object `A` used in `X and A or B` was falsy in boolean context, Pylint incorrectly emitted non-equivalent ternary-based suggestion. After a change message is correctly not emitted for this case.
    
    Closes \#1559

  - Added `suggestion-mode` configuration flag. When flag is enabled, informational message is emitted instead of cryptic error message for attributes accessed on c-extensions.
    
    Closes \#1466

  - Fix a false positive `useless-super-delegation` message when parameters default values are different from those used in the base class.
    
    Closes \#1085

  - Disabling 'wrong-import-order', 'wrong-import-position', or 'ungrouped-imports' for a single line now prevents that line from triggering violations on subsequent lines.
    
    Closes \#1336

  - Added a new Python check for inconsistent return statements inside method or function.
    
    Closes \#1267

  - Fix `superfluous-parens` false positive related to handling logical statements involving `in` operator.
    
    Closes \#574

  - `function-redefined` message is no longer emitted for functions and methods which names matches dummy variable name regular expression.
    
    Closes \#1369

  - Fix `missing-param-doc` and `missing-type-doc` false positives when mixing `Args` and `Keyword Args` in Google docstring.
    
    Closes \#1409

>   - Fix `missing-docstring` false negatives when modules, classes, or methods consist of compound statements that exceed the `docstring-min-length`

  - Fix `useless-else-on-loop` false positives when break statements are deeply nested inside loop.
    
    Closes \#1661

  - Fix no `wrong-import-order` message emitted on ordering of first and third party libraries. With this fix, pylint distinguishes third and first party modules when checking import order.
    
    Closes \#1702

  - Fix `pylint disable=fixme` directives ignored for comments following the last statement in a file.
    
    Closes \#1681

  - Fix `line-too-long` message deactivated by wrong disable directive. The directive `disable=fixme` doesn't deactivate anymore the emission of `line-too-long` message for long commented lines.
    
    Closes \#1741

  - If the rcfile specified on the command line doesn't exist, then an IOError exception is raised.
    
    Closes \#1747

  - Fix the wrong scope of the `disable=` directive after a commented line. For example when a `disable=line-too-long` directive is at the end of a long commented line, it no longer disables the emission of `line-too-long` message for lines that follow.
    
    Closes \#1742

# What's New In Pylint 1.8

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

# Summary -- Release highlights

  - None so far

# New checkers

  - A new check was added, `shallow-copy-environ`.
    
    This warning message is emitted when shallow copy of os.environ is created. Shallow copy of os.environ doesn't work as people may expect. os.environ is not a dict object but rather a proxy object, so any changes made on copy may have unexpected effects on os.environ
    
    Instead of copy.copy(os.environ) method os.environ.copy() should be used.
    
    See <https://bugs.python.org/issue15373> for details.
    
      - \`\`\`python  
        import copy import os wrong\_env\_copy = copy.copy(os.environ) \# will emit pylint warning wrong\_env\_copy\['ENV\_VAR'\] = 'new\_value' \# changes os.environ assert os.environ\['ENV\_VAR'\] == 'new\_value'
        
        good\_env\_copy = dict(os.environ) \# the right way good\_env\_copy\['ENV\_VAR'\] = 'different\_value' \# doesn't change os.environ assert os.environ\['ENV\_VAR'\] == 'new\_value'

  - A new check was added, `keyword-arg-before-vararg`.
    
    This warning message is emitted when a function is defined with a keyword argument appearing before variable-length positional arguments (\*args). This may lead to args list getting modified if keyword argument's value is not provided in the function call assuming it will take default value provided in the definition.
    
    ``` python
    def foo(a, b=3, *args):
        print(a, b, args)
    
    # Case1: a=0, b=2, args=(4,5)
    foo(0,2,4,5) # 0 2 (4,5) ==> Observed values are same as expected values
    
    # Case2: a=0, b=<default_value>, args=(4,5)
    foo(0,4,5) # 0 4 (5,) ==> args list got modified as well as the observed value of b
    
    # Case3: Syntax Error if tried as follows
    foo(0,b=2,4,5) # syntax error
    ```

  - A new check was added, `simplify-boolean-expression`.
    
    This message is emitted when `consider-using-ternary` check would emit not equivalent code, due to truthy element being falsy in boolean context.
    
    ``` python
    value = condition and False or other_value
    ```
    
    This flawed construct may be simplified to:
    
    ``` python
    value = other_value
    ```

  - A new check was added, `bad-thread-instantiation`.
    
    This message is emitted when the threading.Thread class does not receive the target argument, but receives just one argument, which is by default the group parameter.
    
    In the following example, the instantiation will fail, which is definitely not desired:
    
    ``` python
    import threading
    threading.Thread(lambda: print(1)) # Oups, this is the group parameter
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing functions that have been removed from the itertools module `izip`, `imap`, `iflter`, `izip_longest`, and `ifilterfalse`.
    
    ``` python
    from itertools import izip
    print(list(izip([1, 2], [3])))
    ```
    
    Instead use `six.moves` to import a Python 2 and Python 3 compatible function:
    
    ``` python
    from six.moves import zip
    print(list(zip([1, 2], [3])))
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing deprecated fields from the types module like `ListType` or `IntType`
    
    ``` python
    from types import ListType
    print(isinstance([], ListType))
    ```
    
    Instead use the declarations in the builtin namespace:
    
    ``` python
    print(isinstance([], list))
    ```

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about declaring a `next` method that would have implemented the `Iterator` protocol in Python 2 but is now a normal method in Python 3.
    
    ``` python
    class Foo(object):
        def next(self):
            return 42
    ```
    
    Instead implement a `__next__` method and use `six.Iterator` as a base class or alias `next` to `__next__`:
    
    ``` python
    class Foo(object):
        def __next__(self):
            return 42
        next = __next__
    ```

  - Three new Python 3 checkers were added to warn about using dictionary methods in non-iterating contexts.
    
    For example, the following are returning iterators in Python 3:
    
        .. code-block:: python
    
    > d = {} d.keys()\[0\] d.items()\[0\] d.values() + d.keys()

  - A new Python 3 porting check was added, `non-ascii-bytes-literals`
    
    This message is emitted whenever we detect that a bytes string contain non-ASCII characters, which results in a SyntaxError on Python 3.

  - A new warning, `raising-format-tuple`, will catch situations where the intent was likely raising an exception with a formatted message string, but the actual code did omit the formatting and instead passes template string and value parameters as separate arguments to the exception constructor. So it detects things like
    
    ``` python
    raise SomeError('message about %s', foo)
    raise SomeError('message about {}', foo)
    ```
    
    which likely were meant instead as
    
    ``` python
    raise SomeError('message about %s' % foo)
    raise SomeError('message about {}'.format(foo))
    ```
    
    This warning can be ignored on projects which deliberately use lazy formatting of messages in all user-facing exception handlers.

  - Following the recommendations of [PEP479]() ,a new Python 3.0 checker was added to warn about raising a `StopIteration` inside a generator. Raising a `StopIteration` inside a generator may be due a direct call to `raise StopIteration`:
    
    ``` python
    def gen_stopiter():
        yield 1
        yield 2
        yield 3
        raise StopIteration
    ```
    
    Instead use a simple `return` statement
    
    ``` python
    def gen_stopiter():
        yield 1
        yield 2
        yield 3
        return
    ```
    
    Raising a `StopIteration` may also be due to the call to `next` function with a generator as argument:
    
    ``` python
    def gen_next_raises_stopiter():
        g = gen_ok()
        while True:
            yield next(g)
    ```
    
    In this case, surround the call to `next` with a try/except block:
    
    ``` python
    def gen_next_raises_stopiter():
        g = gen_ok()
        while True:
            try:
                yield next(g)
            except StopIteration:
                return
    ```

  - The check about raising a StopIteration inside a generator is also valid if the exception raised inherit from StopIteration.
    
    Closes \#1385

> 

  - A new Python checker was added to warn about using a `+` operator inside call of logging methods when one of the operands is a literal string:
    
    ``` python
    import logging
    var = "123"
    logging.log(logging.INFO, "Var: " + var)
    ```
    
    Instead use formatted string and positional arguments :
    
    ``` python
    import logging
    var = "123"
    logging.log(logging.INFO, "Var: %s", var)
    ```

  - A new Python checker was added to warn about `inconsistent-return-statements`. A function or a method has inconsistent return statements if it returns both explicit and implicit values :
    
    ``` python
    def mix_implicit_explicit_returns(arg):
        if arg < 10:
            return True
        elif arg < 20:
            return
    ```
    
    According to [PEP8](), if any return statement returns an expression, any return statements where no value is returned should explicitly state this as return None, and an explicit return statement should be present at the end of the function (if reachable). Thus, the previous function should be written:
    
    ``` python
    def mix_implicit_explicit_returns(arg):
        if arg < 10:
            return True
        elif arg < 20:
            return None
    ```
    
    Closes \#1267

> 

Other Changes `` ` =============  * Fixing u'' string in superfluous-parens message.  * Configuration options of invalid name checker are significantly redesigned.   Predefined rules for common naming styles were introduced. For typical   setups, user friendly options like ``--function-naming-style=camelCase`may   be used in place of hand-written regular expressions. Default linter config   enforce PEP8-compatible naming style. See documentation for details.  * Raise meaningful exception in case of invalid reporter class (output format)   being selected.  * The docparams extension now allows a property docstring to document both   the property and the setter. Therefore setters can also have no docstring.  * The docparams extension now understands property type syntax.`\`python class Foo(object): @property def foo(self): """My Sphinx style docstring description.

>   - type  
>     int
> 
> """ return 10
> 
> ``` python
> ```
> 
> class Foo(object): @property def foo(self): """int: My Numpy and Google docstring style description.""" return 10

  - In case of `--output-format=json`, the dictionary returned holds a new key-value pair. The key is `message-id` and the value the message id.

  - Spelling checker has a new configuration parameter `max-spelling-suggestions`, which affects maximum count of suggestions included in emitted message.

  - The **invalid-name** check contains the name of the template that caused the failure.
    
    For the given code, **pylint** used to emit `invalid-name` in the form `Invalid constant name var`, without offering any context why `var` is not such a good name.
    
    With this change, it is now more clear what should be improved for a name to be accepted according to its corresponding template.

  - New configuration flag, `suggestion-mode` was introduced. When enabled, pylint would attempt to emit user-friendly suggestions instead of spurious errors for some known false-positive scenarios. Flag is enabled by default.

  - `superfluous-parens` is no longer wrongly emitted for logical statements involving `in` operator (see example below for what used to be false-positive).
    
    ``` python
    foo = None
    if 'bar' in (foo or {}):
      pass
    ```

  - Redefinition of dummy function is now possible. `function-redefined` message won't be emitted anymore when dummy functions are redefined.

  - `missing-param-doc` and `missing-type-doc` are no longer emitted when `Args` and `Keyword Args` are mixed in Google docstring.

  - Fix of false positive `useless-super-delegation` message when parameters default values are different from those used in the base class.

  - Fix of false positive `useless-else-on-loop` message when break statements are deeply nested inside loop.

  - The Python 3 porting checker no longer emits multiple `no-absolute-import` per file.

  - The Python 3 porting checker respects disabled checkers found in the config file.

  - Modules, classes, or methods consist of compound statements that exceed the `docstring-min-length` are now correctly emitting `missing-docstring`

  - Fix no `wrong-import-order` message emitted on ordering of first and third party libraries. With this fix, pylint distinguishes first and third party modules when checking import order.

  - Fix the ignored `pylint disable=fixme` directives for comments following the last statement in a file.

  - Fix `line-too-long` message deactivated by wrong disable directive. The directive `disable=fixme` doesn't deactivate anymore the emission of `line-too-long` message for long commented lines.

  - If the rcfile specified on the command line doesn't exist, then an IOError exception is raised.

<!-- end list -->

  - \* Fix the wrong scope of `disable=` directive after a commented line.  
    For example when a `disable=line-too-long` directive is at the end of a long commented line, it no longer disables the emission of `line-too-long` message for lines that follow.

## What's New in Pylint 1.9?

Release date: 2018-05-15

  - Added two new Python 3 porting checks, `exception-escape` and `comprehension-escape`
    
    These two are emitted whenever pylint detects that a variable defined in the said blocks is used outside of the given block. On Python 3 these values are deleted.

  - Added a new `deprecated-sys-function`, emitted when accessing removed sys members.

  - Added `xreadlines-attribute`, emitted when the `xreadlines()` attribute is accessed.

  - The Python 3 porting mode can now run with Python 3 as well.

  - docparams extension allows abstract methods to document what overriding implementations should return, and to raise NotImplementedError without documenting it.
    
    Closes \#2044

  - Special methods do not count towards `too-few-methods`, and are considered part of the public API.

  - Enum classes do not trigger `too-few-methods`
    
    Closes \#605

  - Added a new Python 2/3 check for accessing `operator.div`, which is removed in Python 3
    
    Closes \#1936

  - Added a new Python 2/3 check for accessing removed urllib functions
    
    Closes \#1997

# What's New In Pylint 1.9

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

    1.9

  - Date  
    2018-05-15

# Summary -- Release highlights

  - None so far

# New checkers

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about the removed `operator.div` function.

  - A new Python 3 checker was added to warn about accessing functions that have been moved from the urllib module in corresponding subpackages, such as `urllib.request`.
    
    `` `python     from urllib import urlencode  Instead the previous code should use ``urllib.parse`or`six.moves`to import a module in a Python 2 and 3 compatible fashion:  .. code-block:: python      from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlencode   To have this working on Python 3 as well, please use the`six\`\` library:
    
    ``` python
    six.reraise(Exception, "value", tb)
    ```

  - A new check was added to warn about using unicode raw string literals. This is a syntax error in Python 3:
    
    ``` python
    a = ur'...'
    ```

  - Added a new `deprecated-sys-function` check, emitted when accessing removed `sys` members.

  - Added `xreadlines-attribute` check, emitted when the `xreadlines()` attribute is accessed on a file object.

  - Added two new Python 3 porting checks, `exception-escape` and `comprehension-escape`
    
    These two are emitted whenever pylint detects that a variable defined in the said blocks is used outside of the given block. On Python 3 these values are deleted.
    
    ``` python
    try:
      1/0
    except ZeroDivisionError as exc:
       ...
    print(exc) # This will raise a NameError on Python 3
    
    [i for i in some_iterator if some_condition(i)]
    print(i) # This will raise a NameError on Python 3
    ```

Other Changes `` ` =============  * ``defaultdict`and subclasses of`dict``are now handled for `dict-iter-*` checks. That   means that the following code will now emit warnings for when``iteritems`and friends   are accessed:`\`python some\_dict = defaultdict(list) ... some\_dict.iterkeys()

  - Enum classes no longer trigger `too-few-methods`
  - Special methods now count towards `too-few-methods`, and are considered part of the public API. They are still not counted towards the number of methods for `too-many-methods`.

<!-- end list -->

  - \* docparams allows abstract methods to document returns documentation even  
    if the default implementation does not return something. They also no longer need to document raising a NotImplementedError.

# Full changelog

## What's New in Pylint 2.0?

Release date: 2018-07-15

  - `try-except-raise` should not be emitted if there are any parent exception class handlers.
    
    Closes \#2284

  - `trailing-comma-tuple` can be emitted for `return` statements as well.
    
    Closes \#2269

  - Fix a false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message when exception is raised inside an else statement.
    
    Closes \#1782

  - `ImportFrom` nodes correctly use the full name for the import sorting checks.
    
    Closes \#2181

    Closes \#2187

  - Add a check `consider-using-dict-comprehension` which is emitted if for dict initialization the old style with list comprehensions is used.

  - Add a check `consider-using-set-comprehension` which is emitted if for set initialization the old style with list comprehensions is used.

  - `logging-not-lazy` is emitted whenever pylint infers that a string is built with addition
    
    Closes \#2193

    Closes \#2032

  - Add a check `consider-using-in` for comparisons of a variable against multiple values with "==" and "or"s instead of checking if the variable is contained "in" a tuple of those values.

  - `in` is considered iterating context for some of the Python 3 porting checkers
    
    Closes \#2186

  - Add `--ignore-none` flag to control if pylint should warn about `no-member` where the owner is None

  - Fix a false positive related to `too-many-arguments` and bounded `__get__` methods

    Closes \#2076

  - invalid-slice-index is not emitted when the slice is used as index for a complex object.
    
    We only use a handful of known objects (list, set and friends) to figure out if we should emit invalid-slice-index when the slice is used to subscript an object.

  - Don't emit `unused-import` anymore for typing imports used in type comments.

  - Add a new check 'useless-import-alias'.
    
    Closes \#2052

  - Add `comparison-with-callable` to warn for comparison with bare callable, without calling it.
    
    Closes \#2082

  - Don't warn for `missing-type-doc` and/or `missing-return-type-doc`, if type annotations exist on the function signature for a parameter and/or return type.
    
    Closes \#2083

  - Add `--exit-zero` option for continuous integration scripts to more easily call Pylint in environments that abort when a program returns a non-zero (error) status code.
    
    Closes \#2042

  - Warn if the first argument of an instance/ class method gets assigned
    
    Closes \#977

    Closes \#1453

  - Skip wildcard import check for `__init__.py`.
    
    Closes \#2026

  - The Python 3 porting mode can now run with Python 3 as well.

  - `too-few-public-methods` is not emitted for dataclasses.
    
    Closes \#1793

  - New verbose mode option, enabled with `--verbose` command line flag, to display of extra non-checker-related output. It is disabled by default.
    
    Closes \#1863

  - `undefined-loop-variable` takes in consideration non-empty iterred objects before emitting
    
    Closes \#2039

  - Add support for numpydoc optional return value names.
    
    Closes \#2030

  - `singleton-comparison` accounts for negative checks
    
    Closes \#2037

  - Add a check `consider-using-in` for comparisons of a variable against multiple values with "==" and "or"s instead of checking if the variable is contained "in" a tuple of those values.
    
    Closes \#1977

  - defaultdict and subclasses of dict are now handled for dict-iter-\* checks
    
    Closes \#2005

  - `logging-format-interpolation` also emits when f-strings are used instead of % syntax.
    
    Closes \#1788

  - Don't trigger misplaced-bare-raise when the raise is in a finally clause
    
    Closes \#1924

  - Add a new check, `possibly-unused-variable`.
    
    This is similar to `unused-variable`, the only difference is that it is emitted when we detect a locals() call in the scope of the unused variable. The `locals()` call could potentially use the said variable, by consuming all values that are present up to the point of the call. This new check allows to disable this error when the user intentionally uses `locals()` to consume everything.
    
    Closes \#1909.

  - `no-else-return` accounts for multiple cases
    
    > The check was a bit overrestrictive because we were checking for return nodes in the .orelse node. At that point though the if statement can be refactored to not have the orelse. This improves the detection of other cases, for instance it now detects TryExcept nodes that are part of the .else branch.
    
    Closes \#1852

  - Added two new checks, `invalid-envvar-value` and `invalid-envvar-default`.
    
    The former is trigger whenever pylint detects that environment variable manipulation functions uses a different type than strings, while the latter is emitted whenever the said functions are using a default variable of different type than expected.

  - Add a check `consider-using-join` for concatenation of strings using str.join(sequence)
    
    Closes \#1952

  - Add a check `consider-swap-variables` for swapping variables with tuple unpacking
    
    Closes \#1922

  - Add new checker `try-except-raise` that warns the user if an except handler block has a `raise` statement as its first operator. The warning is shown when there is a bare raise statement, effectively re-raising the exception that was caught or the type of the exception being raised is the same as the one being handled.

  - Don't crash on invalid strings when checking for `logging-format-interpolation`
    
    Closes \#1944

  - Exempt `__doc__` from triggering a `redefined-builtin`
    
    `__doc__` can be used to specify a docstring for a module without passing it as a first-statement string.

  - Fix false positive bad-whitespace from function arguments with default values and annotations
    
    Closes \#1831

  - Fix stop-iteration-return false positive when next builtin has a default value in a generator
    
    Closes \#1830

  - Fix emission of false positive `no-member` message for class with "private" attributes whose name is mangled.
    
    Closes \#1643

  - Fixed a crash which occurred when `Uninferable` wasn't properly handled in `stop-iteration-return`
    
    Closes \#1779

  - Use the proper node to get the name for redefined functions (\#1792)
    
    Closes \#1774

  - Don't crash when encountering bare raises while checking inconsistent returns
    
    Closes \#1773

  - Fix a false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message when if statement is inside try/except.
    
    Closes \#1770

  - Fix a false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message when while loop are used.
    
    Closes \#1772

  - Correct column number for whitespace conventions.
    
    Previously the column was stuck at 0
    
    Closes \#1649

  - Fix `unused-argument` false positives with overshadowed variable in dictionary comprehension.
    
    Closes \#1731

  - Fix false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message when never returning functions are used (i.e sys.exit for example).
    
    Closes \#1771

  - Fix error when checking if function is exception, as in `bad-exception-context`.

  - Fix false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message when a function is defined under an if statement.
    
    Closes \#1794

  - New `useless-return` message when function or method ends with a "return" or "return None" statement and this is the only return statement in the body.

  - Fix false positive `inconsistent-return-statements` message by avoiding useless exception inference if the exception is not handled.
    
    Closes \#1794 (second part)

  - Fix bad thread instantiation check when target function is provided in args.
    
    Closes \#1840

  - Fixed false positive when a numpy Attributes section follows a Parameters section
    
    Closes \#1867

  - Fix incorrect file path when file absolute path contains multiple `path_strip_prefix` strings.
    
    Closes \#1120

  - Fix false positive undefined-variable for lambda argument in class definitions
    
    Closes \#1824

  - Add of a new checker that warns the user if some messages are enabled or disabled by id instead of symbol.
    
    Closes \#1599

  - Suppress false-positive `not-callable` messages from certain staticmethod descriptors
    
    Closes \#1699

  - Fix indentation handling with tabs
    
    Closes \#1148

  - Fix false-positive `bad-continuation` error
    
    Closes \#638

  - Fix false positive unused-variable in lambda default arguments
    
    Closes \#1921 Closes \#1552 Closes \#1099 Closes \#210

  - Updated the default report format to include paths that can be clicked on in some terminals (e.g. iTerm).

  - Fix inline def behavior with `too-many-statements` checker
    
    Closes \#1978

  - Fix `KeyError` raised when using docparams and NotImplementedError is documented.
    
    Closes \#2102

  - Fix 'method-hidden' raised when assigning to a property or data descriptor.

  - Fix emitting `useless-super-delegation` when changing the default value of keyword arguments.
    
    Closes \#2022

  - Expand ignored-argument-names include starred arguments and keyword arguments

# What's New In Pylint 2.0

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.0

  - Date  
    2018-07-15

# Summary -- Release highlights

  - Dropped support for Python 2. This release will work only on Python 3.4+.
    
    If you need to use `pylint` with Python 2, you can use Pylint 1.9+. We'll continue to do bug releases until 2020, when Python 2 goes officially EOL. `pylint` will gain the ability to analyze Python 2 files, but some checks might not work as they will assume that their running environment is Python 2.

  - Given the dropping of Python 2, the Python 3 porting mode (enabled via `--py3k`) can now also run with Python 3.
    
    The porting mode used to be a no-op on Python 3, but most of the messages can now be emitted when the running interpreter is Python 3. The only messages that won't be emitted are those that rely on a particular syntax specific to Python 2, for instance `print` as a statement.

# New checkers

  - A new check was added, `useless-object-inheritance`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when pylint detects that a class inherits from object, which is redundant as in Python 3, every class implicitly inherits from object.
    
      - \`\`\`python
        
          - class A(object):  
            pass
        
          - class A: \# better  
            pass

  - A new check was added, `comparison-with-callable`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when pylint detects that a comparison with a callable was made, which might suggest that some parenthesis were omitted, resulting in potential unwanted behaviour.
    
    ``` python
    def foo():
        return None
    
    def goo():
        return None
    
    if foo == 786:  # bad
        pass
    
    if foo() == 786:    # good
        pass
    ```

  - A new check was added, `chained-comparison`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted if a boolean operation can be simplified by chaining some of its operations. check below example:
    
    ``` python
    if a < b and b < c:
        pass
    
    if a < b < c:   # better
        pass
    ```

  - A new check was added, `useless-import-alias`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when an import alias does not rename the original package.
    
    ``` python
    import numpy as numpy # bad
    import numpy as np # good
    from collection import OrderedDict as OrderedDict # bad
    from collection import OrderedDict as ordered_dict # good
    ```

  - A new check was added, `comparison-with-itself`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when a variable is compared against itself.
    
    ``` python
    if variable == variable:  # bad
        pass
    ```

  - A new check was added, `consider-using-in`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when a variable is compared against multiple values concatenated by ors instead of using the faster, more idiomatic "in" check.
    
    ``` python
    if variable == 1 or variable == 2 or variable == 3:  # bad
        pass
    
    if variable in (1, 2, 3):  # good
        pass
    ```

  - A new check was added, `consider-using-get`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when manually checking if a key is in a dictionary and getting its value if it is (and optionally a default if not) instead of the more idiomatic dict.get.
    
    ``` python
    if 'key' in dictionary:  # bad
        variable = dictionary['key']
    else:
        variable = 'default'
    
    variable = dictionary.get('key', 'default')  # good
    ```

  - A new check was added, `consider-using-join`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when using a for loop over an iterable to join strings instead of the faster, less memory consuming and more idiomatic str.join(sequence).
    
    ``` python
    result = ''  # bad
    for number in ['1', '2', '3']:
        result += number
    
    result = ''.join(['1', '2', '3'])  # good
    ```

  - New `useless-return` message when function or method ends with a "return" or "return None" statement and this is the only return statement in the body.

  - New `use-symbolic-message-instead` message when a message is activated or deactivated by id instead of symbol. The use of symbol is more explicit and easier to remind.

  - A new check was added, `consider-swap-variables`.
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when using a temporary variable in order to swap the values of two variables instead of the shorter, more idiomatic approach with tuple-unpacking.
    
    Instead of a temporary variable, the one-line syntax with commas should be used.
    
    See this [style guide]() document or the Pycon 2007 <span class="title-ref">swap values presentation</span> for details.
    
    ``` python
    temp = a  # the wrong way
    a = b
    b = temp
    
    a, b = b, a  # the right way
    ```

  - Two new checks, `invalid-envvar-value` and `invalid-envvar-default`, were added.
    
    The former is trigger whenever pylint detects that environment variable manipulation functions uses a different type than strings, while the latter is emitted whenever the said functions are using a default variable of different type than expected.

  - A new check was added, `subprocess-popen-preexec-fn`,
    
    This refactoring message is emitted when using the keyword argument preexec\_fn when creating subprocess.Popen instances which may be unsafe when used in the presence of threads.
    
    See [subprocess.Popen](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#popen-constructor) for full warning details.

  - New `try-except-raise` message when an except handler block has a bare `raise` statement as its first operator or the exception type being raised is the same as the one being handled.

  - New `possibly-unused-variable` check added.

> This is similar to `unused-variable`, the only difference is that it is emitted when we detect a locals() call in the scope of the unused variable. The `locals()` call could potentially use the said variable, by consuming all values that are present up to the point of the call. This new check allows to disable this error when the user intentionally uses `locals()` to consume everything.
> 
> For instance, the following code will now trigger this new error:
> 
> ``` python
> def func():
>     some_value = some_call()
>     return locals()
> ```

  - New `unhashable-dict-key` check added to detect dict lookups using unhashable keys such as lists or dicts.

  - New `self-cls-assignment` warning check added.
    
    This is warning if the first argument of an instance/ class method gets assigned
    
    ``` python
    class Foo(object):
        def foo(self, bar):
            self = bar
    ```

  - New verbose mode option `--verbose` to display of extra non-checker-related output. Disabled by default.

  - Two new checks were added for recommending dict and set comprehensions where possible.
    
    These two checks are going to flag the following examples:
    
    ``` python
    dict([(k, v) for (k, v) in ...]) # better as {k: v for k, v in ...}
    set([k for k in ...]) # better as {k for k in ...}
    ```

Other Changes `` ` =============  * A couple of performance improvements brought to ``astroid`should make`pylint`should be a bit faster as well.    We added a new flag,`max\_inferable\_values`on`astroid.MANAGER`for   limiting the maximum amount of values that`astroid`can infer when inferring   values. This change should improve the performance when dealing with large frameworks   such as`django`.   You can also control this behaviour with`pylint --limit-inference-results`We also rewrote how`nodes\_of\_class`and`get\_children`methods operate which   should result in a performance boost for a couple of checks.  * Fix a false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`message when exception is raised inside   an else statement.  * Don't warn for`missing-type-doc`and/or`missing-return-type-doc`, if type annotations   exist on the function signature for a parameter and/or return type.  * Fix a false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`message when if   statement is inside try/except.  * Fix a false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`message when`while`loop are used.  * Fix emission of false positive`no-member`message for class with   "private" attributes whose name is mangled.  * Fix`unused-argument`false positives with overshadowed variable in dictionary comprehension.  * Fixing false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`when   never returning functions are used (i.e such as sys.exit).  * Fix false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`message when a   function is defined under an if statement.  * Fix false positive`inconsistent-return-statements`message by   avoiding useless exception inference if the exception is not handled.  * Fix false positive`undefined-variable`for lambda argument in class definitions  * Suppress false-positive`not-callable`messages from certain staticmethod descriptors  * Expand`ignored-argument-names`include starred arguments and keyword arguments  *`singleton-comparison`will suggest better boolean conditions for negative conditions.  *`undefined-loop-variable`takes in consideration non-empty iterred objects before emitting.    For instance, if the loop iterable is not empty, this check will no longer be emitted.  * Enum classes no longer trigger`too-few-methods`* Special methods now count towards`too-few-methods`,   and are considered part of the public API.   They are still not counted towards the number of methods for`too-many-methods`.  *`docparams`extension allows abstract methods to document returns   documentation even if the default implementation does not return something.   They also no longer need to document raising a`NotImplementedError.`* Skip wildcard import check for`\_\_init\_\_.py`.  * Don't warn 'useless-super-delegation' if the subclass method has different type annotations.  * Don't warn that a global variable is unused if it is defined by an import`\`python def func(): global sys import sys

  - Added basic support for postponed evaluation of function annotations.
    
    If `pylint` detects the corresponding `from __future__ import annotations` import, it will not emit `used-before-assignment` and `undefined-variable` in the cases triggered by the annotations.
    
    More details on the postponed evaluation of annotations can be read in [PEP 563](https://peps.python.org/pep-0563/).

  - A new command line option was added, `--exit-zero`, for the use of continuous integration scripts which abort if a command returns a non-zero status code. If the option is specified, and Pylint runs successfully, it will exit with 0 regardless of the number of lint issues detected.
    
    Configuration errors, parse errors, and calling Pylint with invalid command-line options all still return a non-zero error code, even if `--exit-zero` is specified.

  - Don't emit `unused-import` anymore for typing imports used in type comments. For instance, in the following example pylint used to complain that `Any` and `List` are not used, while they should be considered used by a type checker.
    
    ``` python
    from typing import Any, List
    a = 1 # type: List[Any]
    ```

  - Fix false positive `line-too-long` for commented lines at the end of module

  - Fix emitting `useless-super-delegation` when changing the default value of keyword arguments.

  - Support `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` for *unused-import* errors
    
    When modules are imported under `typing.TYPE_CHECKING` guard, `pylint` will no longer emit *unused-import*.

  - Fix false positive `unused-variable` in lambda default arguments

  - `assignment-from-no-return` considers methods as well as functions.
    
    If you have a method that doesn't return a value, but later on you assign a value to a function call to that method (so basically it will be `None`), then `pylint` is going to emit an `assignment-from-no-return` error.

  - A new flag was added, `--ignore-none` which controls the `no-member` behaviour with respect to `None` values.
    
    Previously `pylint` was not emitting `no-member` if it inferred that the owner of an attribute access is a `None` value. In some cases, this might actually cause bugs, so if you want to check for `None` values as well, pass `--ignore-none=n` to pylint.

  - Fix false-positive `bad-continuation` for with statements

  - Fix false-positive `bad-whitespace` message for typing annoatations with ellipses in them

  - Fix false-positive `undefined-variable` for nested lambdas

# What's New In Pylint 2.1

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.1

  - Date  
    2018-08-01

# Summary -- Release highlights

  - This release mostly includes fixes for bugs found after the launch of 2.0.

# New checkers

  - A new check was added, `misplaced-format-function`.
    
    This message is emitted when pylint detects that a format function is called on non str object. This can occur due to wrong placement of closing bracket, e.g
    
      - \`\`\`python  
        print('value: {}').format(123) \# bad
        
        print('value: {}'.format(123)) \# good

Other Changes `` ` =============  * ``try-except-raise`check was demoted from an error to a warning, as part of issue #2323.  * Correctly handle the new name of the Python implementation of the`abc`module.    In Python 3.7, the`abc`module has both a C implementation as well as a Python one,   but the Python implementation has a different file name that what`pylint`was expecting,   resulting in some checks getting confused.  * Modules with`\_\_getattr\_\_`are exempted by default from`no-member`There's no easy way to figure out if a module has a particular member when   the said module uses`\_\_getattr\_\_`, which is a new addition to Python 3.7.   Instead we assume the safe thing to do, in the same way we do for classes,   and skip those modules from checking.   *`invalid name`is no longer triggered for function and attribute names longer   than 30 characters. The upper limit was removed completely.   * Fix false-positive`undefined-variable`for self referential class name in lamdbas  *`no-else-return`also specifies the type of the branch that is causing the error.  * Fixed inconsistent behaviour for bad-continuation on first line of file.  * Fixed a bug where`pylint`was not able to disable certain messages on the last line through   the global disable option.  *`pylint`no longer emits`useless-return`when it finds a single statement that is the`return`itself    We still want to be explicit when a function is supposed to return   an optional value; even though`pass`could still work, it's not explicit   enough and the function might look like it's missing an implementation.  * Fixed a bug where`pylint`was crashing when being unable to infer the value of an argument to`next()`*`pylint`no longer emit`not-an-iterable`when dealing with async iterators.  *`pylint`gained the ability to specify a default docstring type for when the check cannot guess the type    For this we added a`--default-docstring-type\`\` command line option.

- Release  
    2.10

  - Date  
    2021-08-20

# Summary -- Release highlights

In 2.10, we added several new default check, like `unspecified-encoding`, `forgotten-debug-statement` or `use-dict-literal`. There's also a few opinionated optional one. You can now forbid while loop or profess your exclusive love of ternary expressions publicly. We promise you hours of arguing fun with your whole team if you add those to your configuration.

We've also fixed some long standing bugs, false positives, or missing options like `ignore-signature` that will now work on inner function's signatures.

A new option to disable the next line, `disable-next`, has been added. It's also possible to export colored diagrams, and plantuml diagram using pyreverse. `PYLINT_HOME` is now `XDG_CACHE_HOME` if not set.

The performance of the similarity checker has been improved, as well as several small performance fixes.

We're going to continue working on improving performance during 2.11. We're also going to finalize a new `possible-forgotten-f-prefix` check that had too much false positives at release time. Check the [possible-forgotten-f-prefix](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/4787) issue if you want to provide knowledge or use case :)

- Release  
    2.11

  - Date  
    2021-09-16

# Summary -- Release highlights

In 2.11, we added a new default checker to advise using f-string as it's the most efficient way of formatting strings right now. You can use [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade), [ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/) or [flynt](https://github.com/ikamensh/flynt) to migrate your old `%` and `format()` automatically.

We added a new extension `SetMembershipChecker` that will advise the use of set for membership test, as it's more performant than lists or tuples. The `CodeStyleChecker` also got some love, check it out if you're not already using it.

We fixed some long standing bugs, false positives, or false negatives and we added small quality of life options like `min-similarity-lines` that disable the duplication check when set to 0.

Under the hood the code for both pylint and astroid is progressively more typed, which could be helpful to you if you're using them as libraries. In order for this new typing to make more sense and stay simple, we deprecated some functions or type that will be removed in the next major version. This is an ongoing effort.

The future `possible-forgotten-f-prefix` check still had too much false positives, and is delayed again. Check the [possible-forgotten-f-prefix](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/4787) issue if you want to provide knowledge or use case :)

# New checkers

  - Added `consider-using-f-string`: Emitted when .format() or '%' is being used to format a string.
    
    Closes \#3592

# Removed checkers

  - The python3 porting mode checker and its `py3k` option were removed. You can still find it in older pylint versions.

# Extensions

  - Added new extension `SetMembershipChecker` with `use-set-for-membership` check: Emitted when using an in-place defined `list` or `tuple` to do a membership test. `sets` are better optimized for that.
    
    Closes \#4776

## CodeStyleChecker

  - Added `consider-using-assignment-expr`: Emitted when an assignment is directly followed by an if statement and both can be combined by using an assignment expression `:=`. Requires Python 3.8
    
    Closes \#4862

# Other Changes

  - Added `py-version` config key (if `[MAIN]` section). Used for version dependent checks. Will default to whatever Python version pylint is executed with.

  - The `invalid-name` message is now more detailed when using multiple naming style regexes.

  - Fix false positive for `consider-using-with` if a context manager is assigned to a variable in different paths of control flow (e. g. if-else clause).
    
    Closes \#4751

  - Fix false positive for `function-redefined` for simple type annotations
    
    Closes \#4936

  - Fix false positive for `protected-access` if a protected member is used in type hints of function definitions

  - Fix false positive `dict-iter-missing-items` for dictionaries only using tuples as keys
    
    Closes \#3282

  - The `unspecified-encoding` checker now also checks calls to `pathlib.Path().read_text()` and `pathlib.Path().write_text()`
    
    Closes \#4945

  - Fix false positive `superfluous-parens` for tuples created with inner tuples
    
    Closes \#4907

  - Fix false positive `unused-private-member` for accessing attributes in a class using `cls`
    
    Closes \#4849

  - Extended `consider-using-in` check to work for attribute access.

  - Setting `min-similarity-lines` to 0 now makes the similarty checker stop checking for duplicate code
    
    Closes \#4901

  - Fix a bug where pylint complained if the cache's parent directory does not exist
    
    Closes \#4900

  - The `global-variable-not-assigned` checker now catches global variables that are never reassigned in a local scope and catches (reassigned) functions
    
    Closes \#1375 Closes \#330

  - The `consider-iterating-dictionary` checker now also considers membership checks
    
    Closes \#4069

# Full changelog

## What's New in Pylint 2.12.2?

Release date: 2021-11-25

  - Fixed a false positive for `unused-import` where everything was not analyzed properly inside typing guards.

  - Fixed a false-positive regression for `used-before-assignment` for typed variables in the body of class methods that reference the same class
    
    Closes \#5342

  - Specified that the `ignore-paths` option considers "" to represent a windows directory delimiter instead of a regular expression escape character.

  - Fixed a crash with the `ignore-paths` option when invoking the option via the command line.
    
    Closes \#5437

  - Fixed handling of Sphinx-style parameter docstrings with asterisks. These should be escaped with by prepending a "".
    
    Closes \#5406

  - Add `endLine` and `endColumn` keys to output of `JSONReporter`.
    
    Closes \#5380

  - Fixed handling of Google-style parameter specifications where descriptions are on the line following the parameter name. These were generating false positives for `missing-param-doc`.
    
    Closes \#5452

  - Fix false negative for `consider-iterating-dictionary` during membership checks encapsulated in iterables or `not in` checks
    
    Closes \#5323

  - `unused-import` now check all ancestors for typing guards
    
    Closes \#5316

## What's New in Pylint 2.12.1?

Release date: 2021-11-25

  - Require Python `3.6.2` to run pylint.
    
    Closes \#5065

## What's New in Pylint 2.12.0?

Release date: 2021-11-24

  - Upgrade astroid to 2.9.0
    
    Closes \#4982

  - Add ability to add `end_line` and `end_column` to the `--msg-template` option. With the standard `TextReporter` this will add the line and column number of the end of a node to the output of Pylint. If these numbers are unknown, they are represented by an empty string.

  - Introduced primer tests and a configuration tests framework. The helper classes available in `pylint/testutil/` are still unstable and might be modified in the near future.
    
    Closes \#4412 \#5287

  - Fix `install graphiz` message which isn't needed for puml output format.

  - `MessageTest` of the unittest `testutil` now requires the `confidence` attribute to match the expected value. If none is provided it is set to `UNDEFINED`.

  - `add_message` of the unittest `testutil` now actually handles the `col_offset` parameter and allows it to be checked against actual output in a test.

  - Fix a crash in the `check_elif` extensions where an undetected if in a comprehension with an if statement within an f-string resulted in an out of range error. The checker no longer relies on counting if statements anymore and uses known if statements locations instead. It should not crash on badly parsed if statements anymore.

  - Fix `simplify-boolean-expression` when condition can be inferred as False.
    
    Closes \#5200

  - Fix exception when pyreverse parses `property function` of a class.

  - The functional `testutils` now accept `end_lineno` and `end_column`. Expected output files without these will trigger a `DeprecationWarning`. Expected output files can be easily updated with the `python tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output` command.

  - The functional `testutils` now correctly check the distinction between `HIGH` and `UNDEFINED` confidence. Expected output files without defined `confidence` levels will now trigger a `DeprecationWarning`. Expected output files can be easily updated with the `python tests/test_functional.py --update-functional-output` command.

  - The functional test runner now supports the option `min_pyver_end_position` to control on which python versions the `end_lineno` and `end_column` attributes should be checked. The default value is 3.8.

  - Fix `accept-no-yields-doc` and `accept-no-return-doc` not allowing missing `yield` or `return` documentation when a docstring is partially correct
    
    Closes \#5223

  - Add an optional extension `consider-using-any-or-all` : Emitted when a `for` loop only produces a boolean and could be replaced by `any` or `all` using a generator. Also suggests a suitable any or all statement.
    
    Closes \#5008

  - Properly identify parameters with no documentation and add new message called `missing-any-param-doc`
    
    Closes \#3799

  - Add checkers `overridden-final-method` & `subclassed-final-class`
    
    Closes \#3197

  - Fixed `protected-access` for accessing of attributes and methods of inner classes
    
    Closes \#3066

  - Added support for `ModuleNotFoundError` (`import-error` and `no-name-in-module`). `ModuleNotFoundError` inherits from `ImportError` and was added in Python `3.6`

  - `undefined-variable` now correctly flags variables which only receive a type annotations and never get assigned a value
    
    Closes \#5140

  - `undefined-variable` now correctly considers the line numbering and order of classes used in metaclass declarations
    
    Closes \#4031

  - `used-before-assignment` now correctly considers references to classes as type annotation or default values in first-level methods
    
    Closes \#3771

  - `undefined-variable` and `unused-variable` now correctly trigger for assignment expressions in functions defaults
    
    Refs \#3688

  - `undefined-variable` now correctly triggers for assignment expressions in if ... else statements This includes a basic form of control flow inference for if ... else statements using constant boolean values
    
    Closes \#3688

  - Added the `--enable-all-extensions` command line option. It will load all available extensions which can be listed by running `--list-extensions`

  - Fix bug with importing namespace packages with relative imports
    
    Closes \#2967 and \#5131

  - Improve and flatten `unused-wildcard-import` message
    
    Closes \#3859

  - In length checker, `len-as-condition` has been renamed as `use-implicit-booleaness-not-len` in order to be consistent with `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison`.

  - Created new `UnsupportedVersionChecker` checker class that includes checks for features not supported by all versions indicated by a `py-version`.
    
      - Added `using-f-string-in-unsupported-version` checker. Issued when `py-version` is set to a version that does not support f-strings (\< 3.6)

  - Fix `useless-super-delegation` false positive when default keyword argument is a variable.

  - Properly emit `duplicate-key` when Enum members are duplicate dictionary keys
    
    Closes \#5150

  - Use `py-version` setting for alternative union syntax check (PEP 604), instead of the Python interpreter version.

  - Subclasses of `dict` are regarded as reversible by the `bad-reversed-sequence` checker (Python 3.8 onwards).
    
    Closes \#4981

  - Support configuring mixin class pattern via `mixin-class-rgx`

  - Added new checker `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison`: Emitted when collection literal comparison is being used to check for emptiness.
    
    Closes \#4774

    Closes \#1064

  - A new `bad-configuration-section` checker was added that will emit for misplaced option in pylint's top level namespace for toml configuration.

# What's New in Pylint 2.12

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

    2.12

  - Date  
    2021-11-24

# Summary -- Release highlights

In 2.12, we introduced a new option `py-version` that permits to analyse code for a python version that may differ from your current python interpreter. This does not affect all checkers but permits, for example, to check for python 3.5 code smells (using f-string's) while using pylint with python 3.6. The minimum version to run pylint is now 3.6.2, while the last working version for python 3.6.0 and 3.6.1 was pylint 2.9.3.

On top of fixing a lot of false positives and bugs, we also added new default checks, like `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison`, `overridden-final-method`, and `useless-with-lock`. There's also better check for TOML configurations.

Lastly, in addition to the information we already had about start line and start column, we introduced new information about the end line and end column of messages. This will permit to have more precise visual clue in IDE like in pylint for vs-code. The default will stay the same to not break compatibility but it can be retrieved by adding `end_line` and `end_column` to the `--msg-template` option. For better result stick to python 3.8+.

The checker for Yoda conditions is now an extension, you might want to enable it if you were relying on this check. There's also a new extension checker, `consider-using-any-or-all` that detects for loops that could be replaced by any or all, entirely contributed by @areveny, welcome to the team \!

# New checkers

  - Added `missing-any-param-doc` triggered when a function has neither parameter nor parameter type documentation. Undocumented parameters are now being properly identified. A warning might start to appear unexpectedly if `missing-param-doc` and `missing-type-doc` were disabled, as a new message `missing-any-param-doc` will be emitted instead.
    
    Closes \#3799

## typing.final

  - Added `overridden-final-method`: Emitted when a method which is annotated with `typing.final` is overridden

  - Added `subclassed-final-class`: Emitted when a class which is annotated with `typing.final` is subclassed
    
    Closes \#3197

  - Created new `UnsupportedVersionChecker` checker class that includes checks for features not supported by all versions indicated by a `py-version`.
    
      - Added `using-f-string-in-unsupported-version` checker. Issued when `py-version` is set to a version that does not support f-strings (\< 3.6)

    Closes \#4774

  - Added `using-final-decorator-in-unsupported-version` checker. Issued when `py-version` is set to a version that does not support typing.final (\< 3.8)

  - Added new checker `useless-with-lock` to find incorrect usage of with statement and threading module locks. Emitted when `with threading.Lock():` is used instead of `with lock_instance:`.
    
    Closes \#5208

  - A new `bad-configuration-section` checker was added that will emit for misplaced option in pylint's top level namespace for toml configuration. Top-level dictionaries or option defined in the wrong section will still silently not be taken into account, which is tracked in a follow-up issue.
    
    Follow-up in \#5259

  - `MessageTest` of the unittest `testutil` now requires the `confidence` attribute to match the expected value. If none is provided it is set to `UNDEFINED`.

  - `add_message` of the unittest `testutil` now actually handles the `col_offset` parameter and allows it to be checked against actual output in a test.

# Extensions

  - Added an optional extension `consider-using-any-or-all`: Emitted when a `for` loop only produces a boolean and could be replaced by `any` or `all` using a generator. Also suggests a suitable any/all statement if it is concise.
    
    Closes \#5008

  - Moved `misplaced-comparison-constant` to its own extension `comparison_placement`. This checker was opinionated and now no longer a default. It can be reactived by adding `pylint.extensions.comparison_placement` to `load-plugins` in your config.

    Closes \#5322

  - Added a `testutil` extra require to the packaging, as `gitpython` should not be a dependency all the time but is still required to use the primer helper code in `pylint.testutil`. You can install it with `pip install pylint[testutil]`.
    
    Closes \#5486

  - Reinstated checks from the python3 checker that are still useful for python 3 (`eq-without-hash`). This is now in the `pylint.extensions.eq_without_hash` optional extension.
    
    Closes \#5025

  - Fixed an issue where `ungrouped-imports` could not be disabled without raising `useless-suppression`.
    
    Refs \#2366

  - Added several checkers to deal with unicode security issues (see [Trojan Sources](https://trojansource.codes/) and [PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/) for details) that also concern the readability of the code. In detail the following checks were added:
    
      - `bad-file-encoding` checks that the file is encoded in UTF-8 as suggested by [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#source-file-encoding). UTF-16 and UTF-32 are [not supported by Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue1503789) at the moment. If this ever changes `invalid-unicode-codec` checks that they aren't used, to allow for backwards compatibility.
      - `bidirectional-unicode` checks for bidirectional unicode characters that could make code execution different than what the user expects.
      - `invalid-character-backspace`, `invalid-character-carriage-return`, `invalid-character-sub`, `invalid-character-esc`, `invalid-character-zero-width-space` and `invalid-character-nul` to check for possibly harmful unescaped characters.
    
    Closes \#5281

  - Use the `tomli` package instead of `toml` to parse `.toml` files.

    Closes \#5588

  - Fixed false positive for `global-variable-undefined` when `global` is used with a class name
    
    Closes \#3088

  - Fixed false positive for `unused-variable` when a `nonlocal` name is assigned as part of a multi-name assignment.
    
    Closes \#3781

    Closes \#5731

  - Fixed a crash involving a `NewType` named with an f-string.
    
    Closes \#5770 Ref pylint-dev/astroid\#1400

  - Improved `bad-open-mode` message when providing `None` to the `mode` argument of an `open()` call.
    
    Closes \#5733

  - Added `lru-cache-decorating-method` checker with checks for the use of `functools.lru_cache` on class methods. This is unrecommended as it creates memory leaks by never letting the instance getting garbage collected.
    
    Closes \#5670

  - Fixed crash with recursion error for inference of class attributes that referenced the class itself.
    
    Closes \#5408 Ref pylint-dev/astroid\#1392

  - Fixed false positive for `unused-argument` when a method overridden in a subclass does nothing with the value of a keyword-only argument.
    
    Closes \#5771 Ref pylint-dev/astroid\#1382

  - The issue template for crashes is now created for crashes which were previously not covered by this mechanism.
    
    Closes \#5668

  -   - Rewrote checker for `non-ascii-name`.  
        It now ensures \_\_all\_\_ Python names are ASCII and also properly checks the names of imports (`non-ascii-module-import`) as well as file names (`non-ascii-file-name`) and emits their respective new warnings.
        
        Non ASCII characters could be homoglyphs (look alike characters) and hard to enter on a non specialized keyboard. See [Confusable Characters in PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusable-characters-in-identifiers)

  - When run in parallel mode `pylint` now pickles the data passed to subprocesses with the `dill` package. The `dill` package has therefore been added as a dependency.

  - Fixed false positive for `global-variable-not-assigned` when the `del` statement is used
    
    Closes \#5333

  - By default, pylint does no longer take files starting with `.#` into account. Those are considered `Emacs file locks`. See <https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Locks.html>. This behavior can be reverted by redefining the `ignore-patterns` option.
    
    Closes \#367

  - Fixed a false positive for `used-before-assignment` when a named expression appears as the first value in a container.
    
    Closes \#5112

  - `used-before-assignment` now assumes that assignments in except blocks may not have occurred and warns accordingly.
    
    Closes \#4761

    Closes \#5371

  - `TypingChecker`

# What's New in Pylint 2.13

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

    2.13

# Summary -- Release highlights

In 2.13, we introduced a new check to deal with unicode security issues. On top of that a lot of work was done inside the unicode checker by @CarliJoy. We also introduced a new check when importing private name and for unnecessary ellipsis among other.

We fixed long standing issues related to duplicate code that could not be disabled, line numbers that were not accurate some of the time, and added the ability to lint all files in a directory without specifying each one. One of the most anticipated issue from the repository. Thank you @matusvalo \!

A lot of `undefined-variables` and `used-before-assignment` issues were resolved thanks to @jacobtylerwalls.

We started integrating `pylint-error` the documentation created by @vald-phoenix a developer from Hlyniane, Ukraine. We hope he's doing well despite the current situation. The deployment is set up but [there's still a lot to do so we welcome any community effort help to review, integrate, and add good/bad examples](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953). This should be doable without any pylint or astroid knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to pylint without investing any time learning the internals.

This release is the last one to support interpreter below 3.7.2, 3.6 end of life was reached in december 2021.

# New checkers

  - Added several checkers to deal with unicode security issues (see [Trojan Sources](https://trojansource.codes/) and [PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/) for details) that also concern the readability of the code. In detail the following checks were added:
    
      - `bad-file-encoding` checks that the file is encoded in UTF-8 as suggested by [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/#source-file-encoding). UTF-16 and UTF-32 are [not supported by Python](https://bugs.python.org/issue1503789) at the moment. If this ever changes `invalid-unicode-codec` checks that they aren't used, to allow for backwards compatibility.
      - `bidirectional-unicode` checks for bidirectional unicode characters that could make code execution different than what the user expects.
      - `invalid-character-backspace`, `invalid-character-carriage-return`, `invalid-character-sub`, `invalid-character-esc`, `invalid-character-zero-width-space` and `invalid-character-nul` to check for possibly harmful unescaped characters.
    
    Closes \#5281

  - `unnecessary-ellipsis`: Emitted when the ellipsis constant is used unnecessarily.
    
    Closes \#5460

  - Added new checker `typevar-name-missing-variance`. Emitted when a covariant or contravariant `TypeVar` does not end with `_co` or `_contra` respectively or when a `TypeVar` is not either but has a suffix.

  - Add `modified-iterating-list`, `modified-iterating-dict`, and `modified-iterating-set`, emitted when items are added to or removed from respectively a list, dictionary or set being iterated through.
    
    Closes \#5348

  - Add checker `redefined-slots-in-subclass`: Emitted when a slot is redefined in a subclass.
    
    Closes \#5617

  -   - Rewrote Checker of `non-ascii-name`.  
        It now ensures \_\_all\_\_ Python names are ASCII and also properly checks the names of imports (`non-ascii-module-import`) as well as file names (`non-ascii-file-name`) and emits their respective new warnings.
        
        Non ASCII characters could be homoglyphs (look alike characters) and hard to enter on a non specialized keyboard. See [Confusable Characters in PEP 672](https://peps.python.org/pep-0672/#confusable-characters-in-identifiers)

  - Added `cache-max-size-none` checker with checks for the use of `functools.lru_cache` on class methods with a `maxsize` of `None`. This is unrecommended as it creates memory leaks by never letting the instance get garbage collected.
    
    Closes \#5670 Closes \#6180

# Removed checkers

  - Removed the deprecated `check_docs` extension. You can use the `docparams` checker to get the checks previously included in `check_docs`.
    
    Closes \#5322

# Extensions

  - New extension `import-private-name`: indicate imports of external private packages and objects (prefixed with `_`). It can be loaded using `load-plugins=pylint.extensions.private_import`.
    
    Closes \#5463

  - Pyreverse - add output in mermaid-js format and html which is an mermaid js diagram with html boilerplate

  - `TypingChecker`
    
      - Added new check `broken-noreturn` to detect broken uses of `typing.NoReturn` if `py-version` is set to Python `3.7.1` or below. <https://bugs.python.org/issue34921>
      - Added new check `broken-collections-callable` to detect broken uses of `collections.abc.Callable` if `py-version` is set to Python `3.9.1` or below. <https://bugs.python.org/issue42965>

  - `DocstringParameterChecker`
    
      - Fixed incorrect classification of Numpy-style docstring as Google-style docstring for docstrings with property setter documentation. Docstring classification is now based on the highest amount of matched sections instead of the order in which the docstring styles were tried.

  - `DocStringStyleChecker`
    
    >   - Disable checker `bad-docstring-quotes` for Python \<= 3.7, because in these versions the line numbers for decorated functions and classes are not reliable which interferes with the checker.
    > 
    > Closes \#3077

# Other Changes

  - Include `testing_pylintrc` in source and wheel distributions.
    
    Closes \#6028

  - Fix false positive for `unused-import` when disabling both `used-before-assignment` and `undefined-variable`.
    
    Closes \#6089

  - Fix false positive for `unnecessary-ellipsis` when using an ellipsis as a default argument.
    
    Closes \#5973

  - Add missing dunder methods to `unexpected-special-method-signature` check.

  - No longer emit `no-member` in for loops that reference `self` if the binary operation that started the for loop uses a `self` that is encapsulated in tuples or lists.
    
    Refs pylint-dev/astroid\#1360 Closes \#4826

  - Fix matching `--notes` options that end in a non-word character.
    
    Closes \#5840

  - The line numbering for messages related to function arguments is now more accurate. This can require some message disables to be relocated to updated positions.

  -   - `using-f-string-in-unsupported-version` and `using-final-decorator-in-unsupported-version` msgids  
        were renamed from `W1601` and `W1602` to `W2601` and `W2602`. Disables using these msgids will break. This is done in order to restore consistency with the already existing msgids for `apply-builtin` and `basestring-builtin` from the now deleted python 3K+ checker. There is now a check that we're not using existing msgids or symbols from deleted checkers.
    
    Closes \#5729

  - Add `--recursive` option to allow recursive discovery of all modules and packages in subtree. Running pylint with `--recursive=y` option will check all discovered `.py` files and packages found inside subtree of directory provided as parameter to pylint.
    
    Closes \#352

  - Updated the position of messages for class and function definitions to no longer cover the complete definition. Only the `def` or `class` + the name of the class/function are covered.
    
    Closes \#5466

  - Reinstated checks from the python3 checker that are still useful for python 3 (`eq-without-hash`). This is now in the `pylint.extensions.eq_without_hash` optional extension.
    
    Closes \#5025

    Closes \#3088

  - Fixed crash on properties and inherited class methods when comparing them for equality against an empty dict.
    
    Closes \#5646

  - By default, pylint does no longer take files starting with `.#` into account. Those are considered [Emacs file locks](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/File-Locks.html). This behavior can be reverted by redefining the `ignore-patterns` option.
    
    Closes \#367

  - Fix `super-init-not-called` when parent or `self` is a `Protocol`
    
    Closes \#4790

    Closes \#3793

  - Fixed a false positive for `invalid-class-object` when the object being assigned to the `__class__` attribute is uninferable.

    Closes \#7078

## What's New in Pylint 2.14.3?

  - Fixed false positive for `undefined-variable` for `__class__` in inner methods.
    
    Closes \#4032

## What's New in Pylint 2.14.2?

Release date: 2022-06-15

  - Fixed a false positive for `unused-variable` when a function returns an `argparse.Namespace` object.
    
    Closes \#6895

  - Avoided raising an identical `undefined-loop-variable` message twice on the same line.

  - Don't crash if `lint.run._query_cpu()` is run within a Kubernetes Pod, that has only a fraction of a cpu core assigned. Just go with one process then.

    Closes \#6888

  - Fixed a false positive for `used-before-assignment` when a try block returns but an except handler defines a name via type annotation.

  - `--errors-only` no longer enables previously disabled messages. It was acting as "emit *all* and only error messages" without being clearly documented that way.
    
    Closes \#6811

## What's New in Pylint 2.14.1?

Release date: 2022-06-06

  - Avoid reporting `unnecessary-dict-index-lookup` or `unnecessary-list-index-lookup` when the index lookup is part of a destructuring assignment.
    
    Closes \#6788

  - Fixed parsing of unrelated options in `tox.ini`.
    
    Closes \#6800

  - Fixed a crash when linting `__new__()` methods that return a call expression.
    
    Closes \#6805

  - Don't crash if we can't find the user's home directory.
    
    Closes \#6802

  - Fixed false positives for `unused-import` when aliasing `typing` e.g. as `t` and guarding imports under `t.TYPE_CHECKING`.
    
    Closes \#3846

  - Fixed a false positive regression in 2.13 for `used-before-assignment` where it is safe to rely on a name defined only in an `except` block because the `else` block returned.
    
    Closes \#6790

  - Fixed the use of abbreviations for some special options on the command line.
    
    Closes \#6810

  - Fix a crash in the optional `pylint.extensions.private_import` extension.
    
    Closes \#6624

  - `bad-option-value` (E0012) is now a warning `unknown-option-value` (W0012). Deleted messages that do not exist anymore in pylint now raise `useless-option-value` (R0022) instead of `bad-option-value`. This allows to distinguish between genuine typos and configuration that could be cleaned up. Existing message disables for `bad-option-value` will still work on both new messages.
    
    Refs \#6794

## What's New in Pylint 2.14.0?

Release date: 2022-06-01

  - The refactoring checker now also raises 'consider-using-generator' messages for `max()`, `min()` and `sum()`.
    
    Refs \#6595

  - We have improved our recognition of inline disable and enable comments. It is now possible to disable `bad-option-value` inline (as long as you disable it before the bad option value is raised, i.e. `disable=bad-option-value,bad-message` not `disable=bad-message,bad-option-value` ) as well as certain other previously unsupported messages.
    
    Closes \#3312

  - Fixed a crash in the `unused-private-member` checker involving chained private attributes.
    
    Closes \#6709

  - Added new checker `comparison-of-constants`.
    
    Closes \#6076

  - `pylint.pyreverse.ASTWalker` has been removed, as it was only used internally by a single child class.
    
    Refs \#6712

  - `pyreverse`: Resolving and displaying implemented interfaces that are defined by the `__implements__` attribute has been deprecated and will be removed in 3.0.
    
    Refs \#6713

  - Fix syntax for return type annotations in MermaidJS diagrams produced with `pyreverse`.

# What's New in Pylint 2.14

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.14

  - Date  
    2022-06-01

# Summary -- Release highlights

With 2.14 `pylint` only supports Python version 3.7.2 and above.

We introduced several new checks among which `duplicate-value` for sets, `comparison-of-constants`, and checks related to lambdas. We removed `no-init` and made `no-self-use` optional as they were too opinionated. We also added an option to generate a toml configuration: `--generate-toml-config`.

We migrated to `argparse` from `optparse` and refactored the configuration handling thanks to Daniël van Noord. On the user side it should change the output of the `--help` command, and some inconsistencies and bugs should disappear. The behavior between options set in a config file versus on the command line will be more consistent. For us, it will permit to maintain this part of the code easily in the future.

As a result of the refactor there are a lot of internal deprecations. If you're a library maintainer that depends on pylint, please verify that you're ready for pylint 3.0 by activating deprecation warnings.

We continued the integration of `pylint-error` and are now at 33%\!. We still welcome any community effort to help review, integrate, and add good/bad examples \<<https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953>\><span class="title-ref">\_. This should be doable without any </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">astroid</span><span class="title-ref"> knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span>\` or open source without any experience with our code\!

# Removed checkers

  - The `no-init` (W0232) warning has been removed. It's ok to not have an `__init__` in a class.
    
    Closes \#2409

  - Removed the `assign-to-new-keyword` message as there are no new keywords in the supported Python versions any longer.

# Other Changes

  - Started ignoring underscore as a local variable for `too-many-locals`.
    
    Closes \#6488

  - Pylint can now be installed with an extra-require called `spelling` (`pip install pylint[spelling]`). This will add `pyenchant` to pylint's dependencies. You will still need to install the requirements for `pyenchant` (the `enchant` library and any dictionaries) yourself. You will also need to set the `spelling-dict` option.

  - Improved wording of the message of `deprecated-module`
    
    Closes \#6169

  - `Pylint` now requires Python 3.7.2 or newer to run.
    
    Closes \#4301

  - We made a greater effort to reraise failures stemming from the `astroid` library as `AstroidError`, with the effect that pylint emits `astroid-error` rather than merely `fatal`. Regardless, please report any such issues you encounter\!

  - We have improved our recognition of inline disable and enable comments. It is now possible to disable `bad-option-value` inline (as long as you disable it before the bad option value is raised, i.e. `disable=bad-option-value,bad-message` not `disable=bad-message,bad-option-value` ) as well as certain other previously unsupported messages.
    
    Closes \#3312

    Closes \#5467

  - Update `invalid-slots-object` message to show bad object rather than its inferred value.
    
    Closes \#6101

    Closes \#6441

  - Fix a failure to respect inline disables for `fixme` occurring on the last line of a module when pylint is launched with `--enable=fixme`.

  - Removed the broken `generate-man` option.
    
    Closes \#5283 Closes \#1887

  - Fixed failure to enable `deprecated-module` after a `disable=all` by making `ImportsChecker` solely responsible for emitting `deprecated-module` instead of sharing responsibility with `StdlibChecker`. (This could have led to double messages.)

  - Added the `generate-toml-config` option.
    
    Refs \#5462

  - `bad-option-value` will be emitted whenever a configuration value or command line invocation includes an unknown message.

    Closes \#5138

  - Fix false negative for `no-member` when attempting to assign an instance attribute to itself without any prior assignment.
    
    Closes \#1555

  - Changed message type from `redefined-outer-name` to `redefined-loop-name` (optional extension) for redefinitions of outer loop variables by inner loops.
    
    Closes \#5608

  - By default the similarity checker will now ignore imports and ignore function signatures when computing duplication. If you want to keep the previous behaviour set `ignore-imports` and `ignore-signatures` to `False`.

  - Pylint now expands the user path (i.e. `~` to `home/yusef/`) and expands environment variables (i.e. `home/$USER/$project` to `home/yusef/pylint` for `USER=yusef` and `project=pylint`) for pyreverse's `output-directory`, `import-graph`, `ext-import-graph`, `int-import-graph` options, and the spell checker's `spelling-private-dict-file` option.

    Refs \#6595

  - Update ranges for `using-constant-test` and `missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test` error messages.

  - Fix `unexpected-special-method-signature` false positive for `__init_subclass__` methods with one or more arguments.
    
    Closes \#6644

# Deprecations

# What's New in Pylint 2.15

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

</div>

  - Release  
    2.15

  - Date  
    2022-08-26

## Summary -- Release highlights

In pylint 2.15.0, we added a new check `missing-timeout` to warn of default timeout values that could cause a program to be hanging indefinitely.

We improved `pylint`'s handling of namespace packages. More packages should be linted without resorting to using the `--recursive=y` option.

We still welcome any community effort to help review, integrate, and add good/bad examples to the doc for \<<https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953>\><span class="title-ref">\_. This should be doable without any </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">astroid</span><span class="title-ref"> knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span>\` or open source without any experience with our code\!

Internally, we changed the way we generate the release notes, thanks to DudeNr33. There will be no more conflict resolution to do in the changelog, and every contributor rejoice.

# What's New in Pylint 2.16

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

</div>

  - Release  
    2.16

  - Date  
    2023-02-01

## Summary -- Release highlights

In 2.16.0 we added aggregation and composition understanding in `pyreverse`, and a way to clear the cache in between run in server mode (originally for the VS Code integration). Apart from the bug fixes there's also a lot of new checks, and new extensions that have been asked for for a long time that were implemented.

If you want to benefit from all the new checks load the following plugins:

    pylint.extensions.dict_init_mutate,
    pylint.extensions.dunder,
    pylint.extensions.typing,
    pylint.extensions.magic_value,

We still welcome any community effort to help review, integrate, and add good/bad examples to the doc for \<<https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5953>\><span class="title-ref">\_. This should be doable without any </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">astroid</span><span class="title-ref"> knowledge, so this is the perfect entrypoint if you want to contribute to </span><span class="title-ref">pylint</span>\` or open source without any experience with our code\!

Last but not least @clavedeluna and @nickdrozd became triagers, welcome to the team \!

### What's new in Pylint 2.16.0?

Release date: 2023-02-01

### Changes requiring user actions

  - The `accept-no-raise-doc` option related to `missing-raises-doc` will now be correctly taken into account all the time.
    
    Pylint will no longer raise missing-raises-doc (W9006) when no exceptions are documented and accept-no-raise-doc is true (issue \#7208). If you were expecting missing-raises-doc errors to be raised in that case, you will now have to add `accept-no-raise-doc=no` in your configuration to keep the same behavior.
    
    Closes \#7208 ([\#7208](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7208))

    Closes \#6006 ([\#6006](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6006))

  - Update `pyreverse` to differentiate between aggregations and compositions. `pyreverse` checks if it's an Instance or a Call of an object via method parameters (via type hints) to decide if it's a composition or an aggregation.
    
    Refs \#6543 ([\#6543](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6543))

  - Release  
    2.17

  - Date  
    2023-03-08

## Summary -- Release highlights

2.17 is a small release that is the first to support python 3.11 officially with the addition of TryStar nodes.

There's still two new default checks: `bad-chained-comparison` and `implicit-flag-alias`, one of them already fixed a previously undetected bug in sentry.

Thanks to the community effort our documentation is almost complete, and every messages should have a proper documentation now. A big thank you to everyone who participated \!

The next release is going to be `3.0.0`, bring breaking changes and enact long announced deprecations. There's going to be frequent beta releases, before the official releases, everyone is welcome to try the betas so we find problems before the actual release.

## What's New in Pylint 2.2.2?

Release date: 2018-11-28

  - Change the `logging-format-style` to use name identifier instead of their corresponding Python identifiers
    
    This is to prevent users having to think about escaping the default value for `logging-format-style` in the generated config file. Also our config parsing utilities don't quite support escaped values when it comes to `choices` detection, so this would have needed various hacks around that.
    
    Closes \#2614

## What's New in Pylint 2.2.1?

Release date: 2018-11-27

  - Fix a crash caused by `implicit-str-concat-in-sequence` and multi-bytes characters.
    
    Closes \#2610

## What's New in Pylint 2.2?

Release date: 2018-11-25

  - Consider `range()` objects for `undefined-loop-variable` leaking from iteration.
    
    Closes \#2533

  - `deprecated-method` can use the attribute name for identifying a deprecated method

> Previously we were using the fully qualified name, which we still do, but the fully qualified name for some `unittest` deprecated aliases leads to a generic deprecation function. Instead on relying on that, we now also rely on the attribute name, which should solve some false positives.
> 
> > Closes \#1653 Closes \#1946

  - Fix compatibility with changes to stdlib tokenizer.

  - `pylint` is less eager to consume the whole line for pragmas
    
    Closes \#2485

  - Obtain the correct number of CPUs for virtualized or containerized environments.
    
    Closes \#2519

  - Change `unbalanced-tuple-unpacking` back to a warning.

> It used to be a warning until a couple of years ago, after it was promoted to an error. But the check might be suggesting the wrong thing in some cases, for instance when checking against `sys.argv` which cannot be known at static analysis time. Given it might rely on potential unknown data, it's best to have it as a warning.
> 
> > Closes \#2522

  - Remove `enumerate` usage suggestion when defining `__iter__` (C0200)
    
    Closes \#2477

  - Emit `too-many-starred-assignment` only when the number of Starred nodes is per assignment elements
    
    Closes \#2513

  - `try-except-raise` checker now handles multilevel inheritance hirerachy for exceptions correctly.
    
    Closes \#2484

  - Add a new check, `simplifiable-if-expression` for expressions like `True if cond else False`.
    
    Closes \#2487

  - `too-few-public-methods` is not reported for `typing.NamedTuple`
    
    Closes \#2459

  - `` `too-few-public-methods `` is not reported for dataclasses created with options.
    
    Closes \#2488

  - Remove wrong modules from 'bad-python3-import'.
    
    Closes \#2453

  - The `json` reporter prints an empty list when no messages are emitted
    
    Closes \#2446

  - Add a new check, `duplicate-string-formatting-argument`

> This new check is emitted whenever a duplicate string formatting argument is found.
> 
> > Closes \#497

  - `assignment-from-no-return` is not emitted for coroutines.
    
    Closes \#1715

  - Report format string type mismatches.

  - `consider-using-ternary` and `simplified-boolean-expression` no longer emit for sequence based checks
    
    Closes \#2473

  - Handle `AstroidSyntaxError` when trying to import a module.
    
    Closes \#2313

  - Allow `__module__` to be redefined at a class level.
    
    Closes \#2451

  - `pylint` used to emit an `unused-variable` error if unused import was found in the function. Now instead of `unused-variable`, `unused-import` is emitted.
    
    Closes \#2421

  - Handle asyncio.coroutine when looking for `not-an-iterable` check.
    
    Closes \#996

  - The `locally-enabled` check is gone.
    
    Closes \#2442

  - Infer decorated methods when looking for method-hidden
    
    Closes \#2369

  - Pick the latest value from the inferred values when looking for `raising-non-exception`
    
    Closes \#2431

  - Extend the TYPE\_CHECKING guard to TYPE\_CHECKING name as well, not just the attribute
    
    Closes \#2411

  - Ignore import x.y.z as z cases for checker `useless-import-alias`.
    
    Closes \#2309

  - Fix false positive `undefined-variable` and `used-before-assignment` with nonlocal keyword usage.
    
    Closes \#2049

  - Stop `protected-access` exception for missing class attributes

  - Don't emit `assignment-from-no-return` for decorated function nodes
    
    Closes \#2385

  - `unnecessary-pass` is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement.
    
    In Python, stubbed functions often have a body that contains just a single `pass` statement, indicating that the function doesn't do anything. However, a stubbed function can also have just a docstring, and function with a docstring and no body also does nothing.
    
    Closes \#2208

  - `duplicate-argument-name` is emitted for more than one duplicate argument per function
    
    Closes \#1712

  - Allow double indentation levels for more distinguishable indentations
    
    Closes \#741

  - Fix --ignore-imports to understand multi-line imports
    
    Closes \#1422 Closes \#2019

  - Add a new check 'implicit-str-concat-in-sequence' to spot string concatenation inside lists, sets & tuples.

  - `literal-comparison` is now emitted for 0 and 1 literals.

# What's New In Pylint 2.2

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.2

  - Date  
    2018-11-25

# Summary -- Release highlights

# New checkers

  - String checker now reports format string type mismatches.

  - `duplicate-string-formatting-argument` was added for detecting duplicate string formatting arguments that should be passed instead as named arguments.

  - `logging-format-style` is a new option for the logging checker for usage of str.format() style format strings in calls to loggers.
    
    It accepts two options: `--logging-format-style=old` for using <span class="title-ref">%</span> style formatting, which is the assumed default, and `--logging-format-style=new` for using <span class="title-ref">{}</span> style formatting.

  - `implicit-str-concat-in-sequence` detects string concatenation inside lists, sets & tuples.
    
    Example of code that would generate such warning:
    
      - \`\`\`python  
        woops = ('a', 'b' 'c')

Other Changes `` ` =============  * ``try-except-raise`checker now handles multilevel inheritance hirerachy for exceptions correctly.    Closes #2484  * Ignore import x.y.z as z cases for checker`useless-import-alias`.  *`unnecessary-pass`is now also emitted when a function or class contains only docstring and pass statement,   in which case, docstring is enough for empty definition.  * Fix false positive`undefined-variable`and`used-before-assignment`with nonlocal keyword usage.  * Fix exceptions being raised when one of the params is not a ClassDef for`checkers.utils.is\_subclass\_of`.  *`pylint`now picks the latest value from the inferred values of the exception that gets   raised, when looking for`raising-non-exception`. This helps when reusing a variable name   for multiple types, since`pylint`was picking just the first inferred value, leading   to spurious false positives.    Closes #2431  *`pylint`used to emit a`not-an-iterable`error when looking at coroutines built   with`asyncio.coroutine`. This is no longer the case as we handle coroutines explicitly.    Closes #996  *`pylint`used to emit an`unused-variable`error if unused import was found in the function. Now instead of`unused-variable`,`unused-import\`\` is emitted.

## What's New in Pylint 2.3.0?

Release date: 2019-02-27

  - Protect against `NonDeducibleTypeHierarchy` when calling semi-private `is_subtype`
    
    `astroid.helpers.is_subtype` raises `NonDeducibleTypeHierarchy` when it cannot infer the base classes of the given types, but that makes sense in its context given that the method is mostly used to inform the inference process about the hierarchy of classes. Doesn't make that much sense for `pylint` itself, which is why we're handling the exception here, rather than in `astroid`
    
    Closes pylint-dev/astroid\#644

  - Added a new command line option `list-groups` for listing all the check groups `pylint` knows about.

  - Allow `BaseException` for emitting `broad-except`, just like `Exception`.
    
    Closes \#2741

  - Fixed a crash that occurred for `bad-str-strip-call` when `strip()` received `None`
    
    Closes \#2743

  - Don't emit `*-not-iterating` checks for builtins consumed by `itertools`
    
    Closes \#2731

  - Fix a crash caused by iterating over `Uninferable` in a string formatting check.
    
    Closes \#2727

  - Fixed false positives for `no-self-argument` and `unsubscriptable-object` when using `__class_getitem__` (new in Python 3.7)
    
    Closes \#2416

  - Support `Ellipsis` as a synonym for `pass` statements.
    
    Closes \#2718

  - `fixme` gets triggered only on comments.
    
    Closes \#2321

  - Fixed a false positive for `unused-variable` and `nonlocal` assignments
    
    Closes \#2671

  - Added `load_configuration()` hook for plugins
    
    New optional hook for plugins is added: `load_configuration()`. This hook is executed after configuration is loaded to prevent overwriting plugin specific configuration via user-based configuration.
    
    Closes \#2635

  - Fix missing-raises-doc false positive (W9006)
    
    Closes \#1502

  - Exempt starred unpacking from `*-not-iterating` Python 3 checks
    
    Closes \#2651

  - Make `compare-to-zero` less zealous by checking against equality and identity
    
    Closes \#2645

  - Add `no-else-raise` warning (R1720)
    
    Closes \#2558

  - Exempt `yield from` from `*-not-iterating` Python 3 checks.
    
    Closes \#2643

  - Fix incorrect generation of `no-else-return` warnings (R1705)
    
    Fixed issue where `if` statements with nested `if` statements were incorrectly being flagged as `no-else-return` in some cases and not being flagged as `no-else-return` in other cases. Added tests for verification and updated pylint source files to eliminate newly exposed warnings.

  - Fix false positive with `not-async-context-manager` caused by not understanding `contextlib.asynccontextmanager`
    
    Closes \#2440

  - Refactor `bad-reversed-sequence` to account for more objects that can define `__reversed__`
    
    One such object would be an enum class, for which `__reversed__` yields each individual enum. As such, the check for `bad-reversed-sequence` needs to not differentiate between classes and instances when it comes for checking of `__reversed__` presence.
    
    Closes \#2598

  - Added `wrong-exception-operation`
    
    Used when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary operations between exceptions in except handlers.
    
    Closes \#2494

  - `no-member` is emitted for enums when they lack a member
    
    Previously we weren't doing this because we detected a `__getattr__` implementation on the `Enum` class (and this check is skipped for classes with `__getattr__`), but that is fine for Enums, given that they are inferred in a customised way in astroid.
    
    Closes \#2565

  - Generalize `chained-comparison`
    
    Previous version incorrectly detects <span class="title-ref">a \< b \< c and b \< d</span> and fails to detect <span class="title-ref">a \< b \< c and c \< d</span>.

  - Avoid popping \_\_main\_\_ when using multiple jobs
    
    Closes \#2689

  - Add a new option 'check-str-concat-over-line-jumps' to check 'implicit-str-concat-in-sequence'

  - Fixes for the new style logging format linter.
    
    The number of arguments was not handled properly, leading to an always successful check.

  - Fix false positive `not-callable` for uninferable properties.

  - Fix false positive `useless-else-on-loop` if the break is deep in the else of an inner loop.

  - Minor improvements to the help text for a few options.

# Summary -- Release highlights

  - This release improves the performance of the 2.X series after it was affected by a performance regression a couple of releases ago.

# New checkers

  - We added a new check message `wrong-exception-operation`. This is emitted when an operation is done against an exception, but the operation is not valid for the exception in question. Usually emitted when having binary operations between exceptions in except handlers.

# Full changelog

## What's New in Pylint 2.4.4?

Release date: 2019-11-13

  - Exempt all the names found in type annotations from `unused-import`
    
    The previous code was assuming that only `typing` names need to be exempted, but we need to do that for the rest of the type comment names as well.
    
    Closes \#3112

  - Relax type import detection for names that do not come from the `typing` module
    
    Closes \#3191

## What's New in Pylint 2.4.3?

Release date: 2019-10-18

  - Fix an issue with `unnecessary-comprehension` in comprehensions with additional repacking of elements.
    
    Closes \#3148

  - `import-outside-toplevel` is emitted for `ImportFrom` nodes as well.
    
    Closes \#3175

  - Do not emit `no-method-argument` for functions using positional only args.
    
    Closes \#3161

  - `consider-using-sys-exit` is no longer emitted when `exit` is imported in the local scope.
    
    Closes \#3147

  - `invalid-overridden-method` takes `abc.abstractproperty` in account
    
    Closes \#3150

  - Fixed `missing-yield-type-doc` getting incorrectly raised when a generator does not document a yield type but has a type annotation.
    
    Closes \#3185

  - `typing.overload` functions are exempted from `too-many-function-args`
    
    Closes \#3170

## What's New in Pylint 2.4.2?

Release date: 2019-09-30

  - `ignored-modules` can skip submodules.
    
    Closes \#3135

  - `self-assigning-variable` skips class level assignments.
    
    Closes \#2930

  - `consider-using-sys-exit` is exempted when `exit()` is imported from `sys`
    
    Closes \#3145

  - Exempt annotated assignments without variable from `class-variable-slots-conflict`
    
    Closes \#3141

  - Fix `utils.is_error` to account for functions returning early.
    
    This fixes a false negative with `unused-variable` which was no longer triggered when a function raised an exception as the last instruction, but the body of the function still had unused variables.
    
    Closes \#3028

## What's New in Pylint 2.4.1?

Release date: 2019-09-25

  - Exempt type checking definitions defined in both clauses of a type checking guard
    
    Closes \#3127

  - Exempt type checking definitions inside the type check guard
    
    In a7f236528bb3758886b97285a56f3f9ce5b13a99 we added basic support for emitting `used-before-assignment` if a variable was only defined inside a type checking guard (using `TYPE_CHECKING` variable from <span class="title-ref">typing</span>) Unfortunately that missed the case of using those type checking imports inside the guard itself, which triggered spurious used-before-assignment errors.
    
    Closes \#3119

  - Require astroid \>= 2.3 to avoid any compatibility issues.

## What's New in Pylint 2.4.0?

Release date: 2019-09-24

  - New check: `import-outside-toplevel`
    
    This check warns when modules are imported from places other than a module toplevel, e.g. inside a function or a class.

  - Handle inference ambiguity for `invalid-format-index`
    
    Closes \#2752

  - Removed Python 2 specific checks such as `relative-import`, `invalid-encoded-data`, `missing-super-argument`.

  - Support forward references for `function-redefined` check.
    
    Closes \#2540

  - Handle redefinitions in case of type checking imports.
    
    Closes \#2834

  - Added a new check, `consider-using-sys-exit`
    
    This check is emitted when we detect that a quit() or exit() is invoked instead of sys.exit(), which is the preferred way of exiting in program.
    
    Closes \#2925

  - `useless-suppression` check now ignores `cyclic-import` suppressions, which could lead to false positives due to incomplete context at the time of the check.
    
    Closes \#3064

  - Added new checks, `no-else-break` and `no-else-continue`
    
    These checks highlight unnecessary `else` and `elif` blocks after `break` and `continue` statements.
    
    Closes \#2327

  - Don't emit `protected-access` when a single underscore prefixed attribute is used inside a special method
    
    Closes \#1802

  - Fix the "statement" values in the PyLinter's stats reports by module.

  - Added a new check, `invalid-overridden-method`
    
    This check is emitted when we detect that a method is overridden as a property or a property is overridden as a method. This can indicate a bug in the application code that will trigger a runtime error.
    
    Closes \#2670

  - Added a new check, `arguments-out-of-order`
    
    This check warns if you have arguments with names that match those in a function's signature but you are passing them in to the function in a different order.
    
    Closes \#2975

  - Added a new check, `redeclared-assigned-name`
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` detects that a name was assigned one or multiple times in the same assignment, which indicate a potential bug.
    
    Closes \#2898

  - Ignore lambda calls with variadic arguments without a context.
    
    Inferring variadic positional arguments and keyword arguments will result into empty Tuples and Dicts, which can lead in some cases to false positives with regard to no-value-for-parameter. In order to avoid this, until we'll have support for call context propagation, we're ignoring such cases if detected. We already did that for function calls, but the previous fix was not taking in consideration `lambdas`
    
    Closes \#2918

  - Added a new check, `self-assigning-variable`. This check is emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned to itself, which might indicate a potential bug in the code application.
    
    Closes \#2930

  - Added a new check, `property-with-parameters`.
    
    This check is emitted when we detect that a defined property also has parameters, which are useless.
    
    Closes \#3006

  - Excluded protocol classes from a couple of checks.
    
    Closes \#3002.

  - Add a check `unnecessary-comprehension` that detects unnecessary comprehensions.
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds list-, set- or dict-comprehensions, that are unnecessary and can be rewritten with the list-, set- or dict-constructors.
    
    Closes \#2905

  - Excluded PEP 526 instance and class variables from `no-member`.
    
    Closes \#2945

  - Excluded `attrs` from `too-few-public-methods` check.
    
    Closes \#2988.

  - `unused-import` emitted for the right import names in function scopes.
    
    Closes \#2928

  - Dropped support for Python 3.4.

  - `assignment-from-no-return` not triggered for async methods.
    
    Closes \#2902

  - Don't emit `attribute-defined-outside-init` for variables defined in setters.
    
    Closes \#409

  - Syntax errors report the column number.
    
    Closes \#2914

  - Support fully qualified typing imports for type annotations.
    
    Closes \#2915

  - Exclude `__dict__` from `attribute-defined-outside-init`

  - Fix pointer on spelling check when the error are more than one time in the same line.
    
    Closes \#2895

  - Fix crash happening when parent of called object cannot be determined

  - Allow of in `GoogleDocstring.re_multiple_type`

  - Added `subprocess-run-check` to handle subrocess.run without explicitly set `check` keyword.
    
    Closes \#2848

  - When we can't infer bare except handlers, skip `try-except-raise`
    
    Closes \#2853

  - Handle more `unnecessary-lambda` cases when dealing with additional kwargs in wrapped calls
    
    Closes \#2845

  - Better postponed evaluation of annotations handling
    
    Closes \#2847

  - Support postponed evaluation of annotations for variable annotations.
    
    Closes \#2838

  - `epylint.py_run` defaults to `python` in case the current executable is not a Python one.
    
    Closes \#2837

  - Ignore raw docstrings when running Similarities checker with `ignore-docstrings=yes` option

  - Fix crash when calling `inherit_from_std_ex` on a class which is its own ancestor
    
    Closes \#2680

  - Added a new check that warns the user if a function call is used inside a test but parentheses are missing.
    
    Closes \#2658

  - `len-as-condition` now only fires when a `len(x)` call is made without an explicit comparison
    
    The message and description accompanying this checker has been changed reflect this new behavior, by explicitly asking to either rely on the fact that empty sequence are false or to compare the length with a scalar.
    
    Closes \#2684

  - Add `preferred-module` checker that notify if an import has a replacement module that should be used.
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds an imported module that has a preferred replacement listed in `preferred-modules`.

  - `assigning-non-slot` not emitted for classes with unknown base classes.
    
    Closes \#2807

  - `old-division` is not emitted for non-Const nodes.
    
    Closes \#2808

    IDEs may benefit from the support for linting from an in-memory file.
    
    Closes \#1187

  - Added a new check `class-variable-slots-conflict`
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds a class variable that conflicts with a slot name, which would raise a `ValueError` at runtime.

  - Added new check: dict-iter-missing-items (E1141)
    
    Closes \#2761

  - Fix issue with pylint name in output of python -m pylint --version
    
    Closes \#2764

    Closes \#2806

  - Added new extension to detect too much code in a try clause
    
    Closes \#2877

  - `signature-mutators` option was added. With this option, users can choose to ignore `too-many-function-args`, `unexpected-keyword-arg`, and `no-value-for-parameter` for functions decorated with decorators that change the signature of a decorated function.
    
    Closes \#259

  - Fixed a pragma comment on its own physical line being ignored when part of a logical line with the previous physical line.
    
    Closes \#199

    Closes \#2963

  - Added `__post_init__` to `defining-attr-methods` in order to avoid `attribute-defined-outside-init` in dataclasses.
    
    Closes \#2581

  - Changed description of W0199 to use the term 2-item-tuple instead of 2-uple.

  - Allow a `.` as a prefix for Sphinx name resolution.

  - Checkers must now keep a 1 to 1 relationship between "msgid" (ie: C1234) and "symbol" (i.e. : human-readable-symbol)

  - In checkers, an old\_names can now be used for multiple new messages and pylint is now a little faster
    
    It means if you do a partial old\_names for a message definition an exception will tell you that you must rename the associated identification.

  - Allow the choice of f-strings as a valid way of formatting logging strings.
    
    Closes \#2395

  - Added `--list-msgs-enabled` command to list all enabled and disabled messages given the current RC file and command line arguments.

# What's New In Pylint 2.4

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.4

  - Date  
    2019-09-24

# Summary -- Release highlights

# New checkers

  - `import-outside-toplevel`
    
    This check warns when modules are imported from places other than a module toplevel, e.g. inside a function or a class.

  - Added a new check, `consider-using-sys-exit`
    
    This check is emitted when we detect that a quit() or exit() is invoked instead of sys.exit(), which is the preferred way of exiting in program.
    
    Closes \#2925

  - Added a new check, `arguments-out-of-order`
    
    This check warns if you have arguments with names that match those in a function's signature but you are passing them in to the function in a different order.
    
    Closes \#2975

  - Added new checks, `no-else-break` and `no-else-continue`
    
    These checks highlight unnecessary `else` and `elif` blocks after `break` and `continue` statements.
    
    Closes \#2327

  - Added `unnecessary-comprehension` that detects unnecessary comprehensions.
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds list-, set- or dict-comprehensions, that are unnecessary and can be rewritten with the list-, set- or dict-constructors.
    
    Closes \#2905

  - Added a new check, `invalid-overridden-method`
    
    This check is emitted when we detect that a method is overridden as a property or a property is overridden as a method. This can indicate a bug in the application code that will trigger a runtime error.
    
    Closes \#2670

  - Added a new check, `redeclared-assigned-name`
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` detects that a name was assigned one or multiple times in the same assignment, which indicate a potential bug.
    
    Closes \#2898

\* Added a new check, `self-assigning-variable`

> This check is emitted when we detect that a variable is assigned to itself, which might indicate a potential bug in the code application.
> 
> For example, the following would raise th\> **Warning**

  - \>
    
      - def new\_a(attr, attr2):  
        a\_inst = Aclass() a\_inst.attr2 = attr2 \# should be: a\_inst.attr = attr, but have a typo attr = attr return a\_inst
    
    Closes \#2930

  - \* Added a new check `property-with-parameters` which detects when a property  
    has more than a single argument.
    
    Closes \#3006

<!-- end list -->

  - Added `subprocess-run-check` to handle subprocess.run without explicitly set `check` keyword.
    
    Closes \#2848

  - We added a new check message `dict-iter-missing-items`. This is emitted when trying to iterate through a dict in a for loop without calling its .items() method.
    
    Closes \#2761

  - We added a new check message `missing-parentheses-for-call-in-test`. This is emitted in case a call to a function is made inside a test but it misses parentheses.

  - A new check `class-variable-slots-conflict` was added.
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds a class variable that conflicts with a slot name, which would raise a `ValueError` at runtime.
    
    For example, the following would raise an error:
    
        class A:
            __slots__ = ('first', 'second')
            first = 1

  - A new check `preferred-module` was added.
    
    This check is emitted when `pylint` finds an imported module that has a preferred replacement listed in `preferred-modules`.
    
    For example, you can set the preferred modules as `xml:defusedxml,json:ujson` to make `pylint` suggest using `defusedxml` instead of `xml` and `ujson` rather than `json`.

  - A new extension `broad_try_clause` was added.
    
    This extension enforces a configurable maximum number of statements inside of a try clause. This facilitates enforcing PEP 8's guidelines about try / except statements and the amount of code in the try clause.
    
    You can enable this extension using `--load-plugins=pylint.extensions.broad_try_clause` and you can configure the amount of statements in a try statement using `--max-try-statements`.

# Other Changes

  - Don't emit `protected-access` when a single underscore prefixed attribute is used inside a special method
    
    Closes \#1802

  - `len-as-condition` now only fires when a `len(x)` call is made without an explicit comparison.
    
    The message and description accompanying this checker has been changed reflect this new behavior, by explicitly asking to either rely on the fact that empty sequence are false or to compare the length with a scalar.
    
    OK:
    
        if len(x) == 0:
          pass
        
        while not len(x) == 0:
          pass
        
        assert len(x) > 5, message
    
    KO:
    
        if not len(x):
          pass
        
        while len(x) and other_cond:
          pass
        
        assert len(x), message

  - A file is now read from stdin if the `--from-stdin` flag is used on the command line. In addition to the `--from-stdin` flag a (single) file name needs to be specified on the command line, which is needed for the report.

  - The checker for ungrouped imports is now more permissive.

The import can now be sorted alphabetically by import style. This makes pylint compatible with isort.

The following imports do not trigger an `ungrouped-imports` anymore :

    import unittest
    import zipfile
    from unittest import TestCase
    from unittest.mock import MagicMock

  - The checker for missing return documentation is now more flexible.

The following does not trigger a `missing-return-doc` anymore :

    def my_func(self):
        """This is a docstring.
    
        Returns
        -------
        :obj:`list` of :obj:`str`
            List of strings
        """
        return ["hi", "bye"] #@

  - `signature-mutators` CLI and config option was added.

With this option, users can choose to ignore `too-many-function-args`, `unexpected-keyword-arg`, and `no-value-for-parameter` for functions decorated with decorators that change the signature of a decorated function.

For example a test may want to make use of hypothesis. Adding `hypothesis.extra.numpy.arrays` to `signature_mutators` would mean that `no-value-for-parameter` would not be raised for:

    @given(img=arrays(dtype=np.float32, shape=(3, 3, 3, 3)))
    def test_image(img):
        ...

  - Allow the option of f-strings as a valid logging string formatting method.

`logging-fstring--interpolation` has been merged into `logging-format-interpolation` to allow the `logging-format-style` option to control which logging string format style is valid. To allow this, a new `fstr` value is valid for the `logging-format-style` option.

  - `--list-msgs-enabled` command was added.

When enabling/disabling several messages and groups in a config file, it can be unclear which messages are actually enabled and which are disabled. This new command produces the final resolved lists of enabled/disabled messages, sorted by symbol but with the ID provided for use with `--help-msg`.

  - Fix a false positive of `self-assigning-variable` on tuple unpacking.
    
    Closes \#3433

  - `no-self-use` is no longer emitted for typing stubs.
    
    Closes \#3439

  - Fix a false positive for `undefined-variable` when `__class__` is used
    
    Closes \#3090

  - Emit `invalid-name` for variables defined in loops at module level.
    
    Closes \#2695

    Closes \#2410

  - `typing.overload` functions are exempted from docstring checks
    
    Closes \#3350

  - Emit `invalid-overridden-method` for improper async def overrides.
    
    Closes \#3355

  - Do not allow `python -m pylint ...` to import user code
    
    `python -m pylint ...` adds the current working directory as the first element of `sys.path`. This opens up a potential security hole where `pylint` will import user level code as long as that code resides in modules having the same name as stdlib or pylint's own modules.
    
    Closes \#3386

  - Add `dummy-variables-rgx` option for `_redeclared-assigned-name` check.
    
    Closes \#3341

  - A new check `inconsistent-quotes` was added.

  - Add a check for non string assignment to \_\_name\_\_ attribute.
    
    Closes \#583

  - `__pow__`, `__imatmul__`, `__trunc__`, `__floor__`, and `__ceil__` are recognized as special method names.
    
    Closes \#3281

  - Added errors for protocol functions when invalid return types are detected. E0304 (invalid-bool-returned): \_\_bool\_\_ did not return a bool E0305 (invalid-index-returned): \_\_index\_\_ did not return an integer E0306 (invalid-repr-returned): \_\_repr\_\_ did not return a string E0307 (invalid-str-returned): \_\_str\_\_ did not return a string E0308 (invalid-bytes-returned): \_\_bytes\_\_ did not return a string E0309 (invalid-hash-returned): \_\_hash\_\_ did not return an integer E0310 (invalid-length-hint-returned): \_\_length\_hint\_\_ did not return a non-negative integer E0311 (invalid-format-returned): \_\_format\_\_ did not return a string E0312 (invalid-getnewargs-returned): \_\_getnewargs\_\_ did not return a tuple E0313 (invalid-getnewargs-ex-returned): \_\_getnewargs\_ex\_\_ did not return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)
    
    Closes \#560

  - `missing-*-docstring` can look for `__doc__` assignments.
    
    Closes \#3301

  - `undefined-variable` can now find undefined loop iterables
    
    Closes \#498

  - `safe_infer` can infer a value as long as all the paths share the same type.
    
    Closes \#2503

  - Add a --fail-under \<score\> flag, also configurable in a .pylintrc file. If the final score is more than the specified score, it's considered a success and pylint exits with exitcode 0. Otherwise, it's considered a failure and pylint exits with its current exitcode based on the messages issued.
    
    Closes \#2242

  - Don't emit `line-too-long` for multilines when `disable=line-too-long` comment stands at their end
    
    Closes \#2957

  - Fixed an `AttributeError` caused by improper handling of `dataclasses` inference in `pyreverse`
    
    Closes \#3256

  - Do not exempt bare except from `undefined-variable` and similar checks
    
    If a node was wrapped in a `TryExcept`, `pylint` was taking a hint from the except handler when deciding to emit or not a message. We were treating bare except as a fully fledged ignore but only the corresponding exceptions should be handled that way (e.g. `NameError` or `ImportError`)
    
    Closes \#3235

  - No longer emit `assignment-from-no-return` when a function only raises an exception
    
    Closes \#3218

  - Allow import aliases to exempt `import-error` when used in type annotations.
    
    Closes \#3178

  - ``Ellipsis` is exempted from``multiple-statements\`\` for function overloads.
    
    Closes \#3224

  - No longer emit `invalid-name` for non-constants found at module level.
    
    Pylint was taking the following statement from PEP-8 too far, considering all module level variables as constants, which is not what the statement is saying:
    
    <span class="title-ref">Constants are usually defined on a module level and written in all capital letters with underscores separating words.</span>
    
    Closes \#3111 Closes \#3132

  - Allow `implicit-str-concat-in-sequence` to be emitted for string juxtaposition
    
    Closes \#3030

  - `implicit-str-concat-in-sequence` was renamed `implicit-str-concat`

  - The `json` reporter no longer bypasses `redirect_stdout`.
    
    Closes \#3227

  - Move `NoFileError`, `OutputLine`, `FunctionalTestReporter`, `FunctionalTestFile`, `LintModuleTest` and related methods from `test_functional.py` to `pylint.testutils` to help testing for 3rd party pylint plugins.

  - Can read config from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file.
    
    Closes \#617

  - Fix exception-escape false positive with generators
    
    Closes \#3128

  - `inspect.getargvalues` is no longer marked as deprecated.

  - A new check `f-string-without-interpolation` was added
    
    Closes \#3190

  - Flag mutable `collections.*` utilities as dangerous defaults
    
    Closes \#3183

  - `docparams` extension supports multiple types in raises sections.
    
    Multiple types can also be separated by commas in all valid sections.
    
    Closes \#2729

  - Allow parallel linting when run under Prospector

  - Fixed false positives of `method-hidden` when a subclass defines the method that is being hidden.
    
    Closes \#414

  - Python 3 porting mode is 30-50% faster on most codebases

  - Python 3 porting mode no longer swallows syntax errors
    
    Closes \#2956

  - Pass the actual PyLinter object to sub processes to allow using custom PyLinter classes.
    
    PyLinter object (and all its members except reporter) needs to support pickling so the PyLinter object can be passed to worker processes.

  - Clean up setup.py
    
    Make pytest-runner a requirement only if running tests, similar to McCabe.
    
    Clean up the setup.py file, resolving a number of warnings around it.

  - Handle SyntaxError in files passed via `--from-stdin` option
    
    Pylint no longer outputs a traceback, if a file, read from stdin, contains a syntaxerror.

  - Fix uppercase style to disallow 3+ uppercase followed by lowercase.

  - Fixed `undefined-variable` and `unused-import` false positives when using a metaclass via an attribute.
    
    Closes \#1603

  - Emit `unused-argument` for functions that partially uses their argument list before raising an exception.
    
    Closes \#3246

  - Fixed `broad_try_clause` extension to check try/finally statements and to check for nested statements (e.g., inside of an `if` statement).

  - Recognize classes explicitly inheriting from `abc.ABC` or having an `abc.ABCMeta` metaclass as abstract. This makes them not trigger W0223.
    
    Closes \#3098

  - Fix overzealous `arguments-differ` when overridden function uses variadics
    
    No message is emitted if the overriding function provides positional or keyword variadics in its signature that can feasibly accept and pass on all parameters given by the overridden function.
    
    Closes \#1482 Closes \#1553

  - Multiple types of string formatting are allowed in logging functions.
    
    The `logging-fstring-interpolation` message has been brought back to allow multiple types of string formatting to be used.
    
    Closes \#3361

- Release  
    2.5

  - Date  
    2020-04-27

# Summary -- Release highlights

# New checkers

  - A new check `isinstance-second-argument-not-valid-type` was added.
    
    > This check is emitted whenever **pylint** finds a call to the `isinstance` function with a second argument that is not a type. Such code is likely unintended as it will cause a TypeError to be thrown at runtime error.

  - A new check `assert-on-string-literal` was added.
    
    > This check is emitted whenever **pylint** finds an assert statement with a string literal as its first argument. Such assert statements are probably unintended as they will always pass.

  - A new check `f-string-without-interpolation` was added.
    
    > This check is emitted whenever **pylint** detects the use of an f-string without having any interpolated values in it, which means that the f-string can be a normal string.

  - Multiple checks for invalid return types of protocol functions were added:
    
    >   - `invalid-bool-returned`: `__bool__` did not return a bool
    >   - `invalid-index-returned`: `__index__` did not return an integer
    >   - `invalid-repr-returned)`: `__repr__` did not return a string
    >   - `invalid-str-returned)`: `__str__` did not return a string
    >   - `invalid-bytes-returned)`: `__bytes__` did not return a string
    >   - `invalid-hash-returned)`: `__hash__` did not return an integer
    >   - `invalid-length-hint-returned)`: `__length_hint__` did not return a non-negative integer
    >   - `invalid-format-returned)`: `__format__` did not return a string
    >   - `invalid-getnewargs-returned)`: `__getnewargs__` did not return a tuple
    >   - `invalid-getnewargs-ex-returned)`: `__getnewargs_ex__` did not return a tuple of the form (tuple, dict)

  - A new check `inconsistent-quotes` was added.
    
    > This check is emitted when quotes delimiters (`"` and `'`) are not used consistently throughout a module. It allows avoiding unnecessary escaping, allowing, for example, `"Don't error"` in a module in which single-quotes otherwise delimit strings so that the single quote in `Don't` doesn't need to be escaped.

  - A new check `non-str-assignment-to-dunder-name` was added to ensure that only strings are assigned to `__name__` attributes.

# Other Changes

  - Configuration can be read from a setup.cfg or pyproject.toml file in the current directory. A setup.cfg must prepend pylintrc section names with `pylint.`, for example `[pylint.MESSAGES CONTROL]`. A pyproject.toml file must prepend section names with `tool.pylint.`, for example `[tool.pylint.'MESSAGES CONTROL']`. These files can also be passed in on the command line.

  - Add new `good-names-rgx` and `bad-names-rgx` to enable permitting or disallowing of names via regular expressions
    
    To enable better handling of permitted/disallowed names, we added two new config options: good-names-rgxs: a comma-separated list of regexes, that if a name matches will be exempt of naming-checking. bad-names-rgxs: a comma-separated list of regexes, that if a name matches will be always marked as a disallowed name.

  - Mutable `collections.*` are now flagged as dangerous defaults.

  - Add new `--fail-under` flag for setting the threshold for the score to fail overall tests. If the score is over the fail-under threshold, pylint will complete SystemExit with value 0 to indicate no errors.

  - Added a new option `notes-rgx` to make fixme warnings more flexible. Now either `notes` or `notes-rgx` option can be used to detect fixme warnings.

  - Non-ASCII characters are now allowed by `invalid-name`.

  - `pylint` no longer emits `invalid-name` for non-constants found at module level.
    
    Pylint was considering all module level variables as constants, which is not what PEP 8 is actually mandating.

  - A new check `non-ascii-name` was added to detect identifiers with non-ASCII characters.

  - Overloaded typing functions no longer trigger `no-self-use`, `unused-argument`, `missing-docstring` and similar checks that assumed that overloaded functions are normal functions.

  - `python -m pylint` can no longer be made to import files from the local directory.

  - A new command `--list-extensions` was added.
    
    This command lists all extensions present in `pylint.extensions`.

  - Various false positives have been fixed which you can read more about in the Changelog files.

  - Multiple types of string formatting are allowed in logging functions.

The `logging-fstring-interpolation` message has been brought back to allow multiple types of string formatting to be used. The type of formatting to use is chosen through enabling and disabling messages rather than through the logging-format-style option. The fstr value of the logging-format-style option is not valid.

## What's New in Pylint 2.6.1?

Release date: 2021-02-16

  - Astroid version has been set as \< 2.5
    
    Closes \#4093

## What's New in Pylint 2.6.0?

Release date: 2020-08-20

  - Fix various scope-related bugs in `undefined-variable` checker
    
    Closes \#1082, \#3434, \#3461

  - bad-continuation and bad-whitespace have been removed, black or another formatter can help you with this better than Pylint
    
    Closes \#246, \#289, \#638, \#747, \#1148, \#1179, \#1943, \#2041, \#2301, \#2304, \#2944, \#3565

  - The no-space-check option has been removed. It's no longer possible to consider empty line like a `trailing-whitespace` by using clever options
    
    Closes \#1368

  - `missing-kwoa` is no longer emitted when dealing with overload functions
    
    Closes \#3655

  - mixed-indentation has been removed, it is no longer useful since TabError is included directly in python3
    
    Closes \#2984 \#3573

  - Add `super-with-arguments` check for flagging instances of Python 2 style super calls.

  - Add an faq detailing which messages to disable to avoid duplicates w/ other popular linters

  - Fix superfluous-parens false-positive for the walrus operator
    
    Closes \#3383

  - Fix `fail-under` not accepting floats

  - Fix a bug with `ignore-docstrings` ignoring all lines in a module

  - Fix `pre-commit` config that could lead to undetected duplicate lines of code

  - Fix a crash in parallel mode when the module's filepath is not set
    
    Closes \#3564

  - Add `raise-missing-from` check for exceptions that should have a cause.

  - Support both isort 4 and isort 5. If you have pinned isort 4 in your project requirements, nothing changes. If you use isort 5, though, note that the `known-standard-library` option is not interpreted the same in isort 4 and isort 5 (see the migration guide in isort documentation for further details). For compatibility's sake for most pylint users, the `known-standard-library` option in pylint now maps to `extra-standard-library` in isort 5. If you really want what `known-standard-library` now means in isort 5, you must disable the `wrong-import-order` check in pylint and run isort manually with a proper isort configuration file.
    
    Closes \#3722

  - Fix a crash caused by not guarding against `InferenceError` when calling `infer_call_result`
    
    Closes \#3690

  - Fix a crash in parallel mode when the module's filepath is not set
    
    Closes \#3564

  - Add support to `ignored-argument-names` in DocstringParameterChecker and adds `useless-param-doc` and `useless-type-doc` messages.
  - Add `empty-comment` check for empty comments.
  - Add `simplifiable-condition` check for extraneous constants in conditionals using and/or.
  - Add `condition-evals-to-constant` check for conditionals using and/or that evaluate to a constant.
  - Add `consider-using-generator` check for the use of list comprehension inside `any` or `all` function.

# Other Changes

  - Fix false positive for `builtin-not-iterating` when `zip` or `map` receives iterable
  - Fix linter multiprocessing pool shutdown which triggered warnings when ran in parallels with other pytest plugins.

  - Fix false positive message `useless-super-delegation` when default keyword argument is a dictionary.
  - Fix vulnerable regular expressions in `pyreverse`. The ambiguities of vulnerable regular expressions are removed, making the repaired regular expressions safer and faster matching.
  - `len-as-conditions` is now triggered only for classes that are inheriting directly from list, dict, or set and not implementing the `__bool__` function, or from generators like range or list/dict/set comprehension. This should reduce the false positive for other classes, like pandas's DataFrame or numpy's Array.
  - Fixes duplicate code detection for --jobs=2+
  - New option `allowed-redefined-builtins` defines variable names allowed to shadow builtins.
  - Improved protected access checks to allow access inside class methods

## What's New in Pylint 2.8.3?

Release date: 2021-05-31

  - Astroid has been pinned to 2.5.6 for the 2.8 branch.
    
    Refs \#4527

## What's New in Pylint 2.8.2?

Release date: 2021-04-26

  - Keep `__pkginfo__.numversion` a tuple to avoid breaking pylint-django.
    
    Closes \#4405

  - scm\_setuptools has been added to the packaging.

  - Pylint's tags are now the standard form `vX.Y.Z` and not `pylint-X.Y.Z` anymore.

  - New warning message `deprecated-class`. This message is emitted if import or call deprecated class of the standard library (like `collections.Iterable` that will be removed in Python 3.10).
    
    Closes \#4388

## What's New in Pylint 2.8.1?

Release date: 2021-04-25

  - Add numversion back (temporarily) in `__pkginfo__` because it broke Pylama and revert the unnecessary `pylint.version` breaking change.
    
    Closes \#4399

## What's New in Pylint 2.8.0?

Release date: 2021-04-24

  - New refactoring message `consider-using-with`. This message is emitted if resource-allocating functions or methods of the standard library (like `open()` or `threading.Lock.acquire()`) that can be used as a context manager are called without a `with` block.
    
    Closes \#3413

  - Resolve false positives on unused variables in decorator functions
    
    Closes \#4252

  - Add new extension `ConfusingConsecutiveElifChecker`. This optional checker emits a refactoring message (R5601 `confusing-consecutive-elif`) if if/elif statements with different indentation levels follow directly one after the other.

  - New option `--output=<file>` to output result to a file rather than printing to stdout.
    
    Closes \#1070

  - Use a prescriptive message for `unidiomatic-typecheck`
    
    Closes \#3891

  - Apply `const-naming-style` to module constants annotated with `typing.Final`

  - The packaging is now done via setuptools exclusively. `doc`, `tests`, `man`, `elisp` and `Changelog` are not packaged anymore - reducing the size of the package by 75%.

  - Debian packaging is now (officially) done in <https://salsa.debian.org/python-team/packages/pylint>.

  - The 'doc' extra-require has been removed.

  - `__pkginfo__` now only contain `__version__` (also accessible with `pylint.__version__`), other meta-information are still accessible with `from importlib import metadata;metadata.metadata('pylint')`.

  - COPYING has been renamed to LICENSE for standardization.

  - Fix false-positive `used-before-assignment` in function returns.
    
    Closes \#4301

  - Updated `astroid` to 2.5.3
    
    Closes \#2822, \#4206, \#4284

  - Add `consider-using-min-max-builtin` check for if statement which could be replaced by Python builtin min or max
    
    Closes \#3406

  - Don't auto-enable postponed evaluation of type annotations with Python 3.10

  - Update `astroid` to 2.5.4

  - Add new extension `TypingChecker`. This optional checker can detect the use of deprecated typing aliases and can suggest the use of the alternative union syntax where possible. (For example, 'typing.Dict' can be replaced by 'dict', and 'typing.Unions' by '|', etc.) Make sure to check the config options if you plan on using it\!

  - Reactivates old counts in report mode.
    
    Closes \#3819

  - During detection of `inconsistent-return-statements` consider that `assert False` is a return node.
    
    Closes \#4019

  - Run will not fail if score exactly equals `config.fail_under`.

  - Functions that never returns may declare `NoReturn` as type hints, so that `inconsistent-return-statements` is not emitted.
    
    Closes \#4122, \#4188

  - Improved protected access checks to allow access inside class methods
    
    Closes \#1159

  - Fix issue with PEP 585 syntax and the use of `collections.abc.Set`

  - Fix issue that caused class variables annotated with `typing.ClassVar` to be identified as class constants. Now, class variables annotated with `typing.Final` are identified as such.
    
    Closes \#4277

  - Continuous integration with read the doc has been added.
    
    Closes \#3850

  - Don't show `DuplicateBasesError` for attribute access

  - Fix crash when checking `setup.cfg` for pylint config when there are non-ascii characters in there
    
    Closes \#4328

  - Allow code flanked in backticks to be skipped by spellchecker
    
    Closes \#4319

  - Allow Python tool directives (for black, flake8, zimports, isort, mypy, bandit, pycharm) at beginning of comments to be skipped by spellchecker
    
    Closes \#4320

  - Fix issue that caused Emacs pylint to fail when used with tramp

  - Improve check for invalid PEP 585 syntax inside functions if postponed evaluation of type annotations is enabled

  - Improve check for invalid PEP 585 syntax as default function arguments

# What's New In Pylint 2.9

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

From pylint 1.6.0 to 2.14.0, on top of the full changelog there was also a summary of (mostly user facing) changes.

- Release  
    2.9

  - Date  
    2021-06-29

# Summary -- Release highlights

Pylint is now compatible with python 3.10.

A lot of new checks have been added, some non-opinionated performance warnings like `use-maxsplit-arg`, some consensual style warnings like `unnecessary-dict-index-lookup` or new deprecation checks.

We're aiming to reduce pylint noise for first time users and making some new checks optional is a step in that direction. In order to do that we created an optional code style checker that can be loaded using `pylint.extensions.code_style` with the `load-plugins` options. More than ever, if as a veteran you want the most checks you can possibly get, [you should check the list of pylint extensions.](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/checkers/extensions.html#optional-checkers).

# New checkers

  - `deprecated-decorator`: Emitted when deprecated decorator is used.
  - `consider-using-dict-items`: Emitted when iterating over dictionary keys and then indexing the same dictionary with the key within loop body.
  - `use-maxsplit-arg`: Emitted either when accessing only the first or last element of `str.split()`.
  - An `ignore_signatures` option has been added to the similarity checker. It will permits to reduce false positives when multiple functions have the same parameters.
  - `unnecessary-dict-index-lookup`: Emitted when iterating over dictionary items (key-value pairs) and accessing the value by index lookup.
  - `consider-using-from-import`: Emitted when a submodule/member of a package is imported and aliased with the same name.
  - New checker `unused-private-member`: Emitted when a private member (i.e., starts with `__`) of a class is defined but not used.
  - New checker `invalid-class-object`: Emitted when a non-class is assigned to a `__class__` attribute.
  - `invalid-all-format`: Emitted when `__all__` has an invalid format, i.e. isn't a `tuple` or `list`.
  - New checker `await-outside-async`: Emitted when await is used outside an async function.
  - Add new extension `CodeStyleChecker`. It includes checkers that can improve code consistency. As such they don't necessarily provide a performance benefit and are often times opinionated.
      - `consider-using-tuple`: Emitted when an in-place defined list or set can be replaced by a tuple.
      - `consider-using-namedtuple-or-dataclass`: Emitted when dictionary values can be replaced by namedtuples or dataclass instances.

# Other Changes

  - Fix false-positive `consider-using-with` (R1732) if a ternary conditional is used together with `with`
  - Fix false-positive `consider-using-with` (R1732) if `contextlib.ExitStack` takes care of calling the `__exit__` method
  - Add type annotations to pyreverse dot files
  - Pylint's tags are now the standard form `vX.Y.Z` and not `pylint-X.Y.Z` anymore.
  - Fix false-positive `too-many-ancestors` when inheriting from builtin classes, especially from the `collections.abc` module
  - The output messages for `arguments-differ` error message have been customized based on the different error cases.
  - New option `--fail-on=<msg ids>` to return non-zero exit codes regardless of `fail-under` value.
  - A new error called `arguments-renamed` has been created, which identifies any changes at the parameter names of overridden functions. It aims to separate the functionality of `arguments-differ`.
  - Fix incompatibility with Python 3.6.0 caused by `typing.Counter` and `typing.NoReturn` usage
  - Allow comma-separated list in `output-format` and separate output files for each specified format. Each output file can be defined after a semicolon for example : `--output-format=json:myfile.json,colorized`
  - The `using-constant-test` checker now detects constant tests consisting of list literals like `[]` and `[1, 2, 3]`.
  - `ignore-paths` configuration directive has been added. Defined regex patterns are matched against file path.
  - Added handling of floating point values when parsing configuration from pyproject.toml

# What's New in Pylint 3.0

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

</div>

  - Release  
    3.0.0

  - Date  
    2023-10-02

## Summary -- Release highlights

Pylint now support python 3.12 officially.

This long anticipated major version also provides some important usability and performance improvements, along with enacting necessary breaking changes and long-announced deprecations. The documentation of each message with an example is very close too.

The required `astroid` version is now 3.0.0. See the [astroid changelog](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/projects/astroid/en/latest/changelog.html#what-s-new-in-astroid-3-0-0) for additional fixes, features, and performance improvements applicable to pylint.

Our code is now fully typed. The `invalid-name` message no longer checks for a minimum length of 3 characters by default. Dependencies like wrapt or setuptools were removed.

A new `json2` reporter has been added. It features an enriched output that is easier to parse and provides more info, here's a sample output.

`` `json     {         "messages": [             {                 "type": "convention",                 "symbol": "line-too-long",                 "message": "Line too long (1/2)",                 "messageId": "C0301",                 "confidence": "HIGH",                 "module": "0123",                 "obj": "",                 "line": 1,                 "column": 0,                 "endLine": 1,                 "endColumn": 4,                 "path": "0123",                 "absolutePath": "0123"             }         ],         "statistics": {             "messageTypeCount": {                 "fatal": 0,                 "error": 0,                 "warning": 0,                 "refactor": 0,                 "convention": 1,                 "info": 0             },             "modulesLinted": 1,             "score": 5.0         }     }  .. towncrier release notes start  What's new in Pylint 3.0.4? ``\` ---------------------------Release date: 2024-02-23

### False Positives Fixed

  - `used-before-assignment` is no longer emitted when using a name in a loop and depending on an earlier name assignment in an `except` block paired with `else: continue`.
    
    Closes \#6804 ([\#6804](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6804))

  - Avoid false positives for `no-member` involving function attributes supplied by decorators.
    
    Closes \#9246 ([\#9246](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9246))

  - Fixed false positive nested-min-max for nested lists.
    
    Closes \#9307 ([\#9307](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9307))

  - Fix false positive for `used-before-assignment` in a `finally` block when assignments took place in both the `try` block and each exception handler.
    
    Closes \#9451 ([\#9451](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9451))

### Other Bug Fixes

  - Catch incorrect ValueError `"generator already executing"` for Python 3.12.0 - 3.12.2. This is fixed upstream in Python 3.12.3.
    
    Closes \#9138 ([\#9138](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9138))

### What's new in Pylint 3.0.3?

Release date: 2023-12-11

### False Positives Fixed

  - Fixed false positive for `unnecessary-lambda` when the call has keyword arguments but not the lambda.
    
    Closes \#9148 ([\#9148](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9148))

  - Fixed incorrect suggestion for shallow copy in unnecessary-comprehension
    
    Example of the suggestion: \#pylint: disable=missing-module-docstring a = \[1, 2, 3\] b = \[x for x in a\] b\[0\] = 0 print(a) \# \[1, 2, 3\]
    
    After changing b = \[x for x in a\] to b = a based on the suggestion, the script now prints \[0, 2, 3\]. The correct suggestion should be use list(a) to preserve the original behavior.
    
    Closes \#9172 ([\#9172](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9172))

  - Fix false positives for `undefined-variable` and `unused-argument` for classes and functions using Python 3.12 generic type syntax.

  - Fix false positive for `invalid-exception-operation` when concatenating tuples of exception types.
    
    Closes \#9288 ([\#9288](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9288))

    Closes \#9100 ([\#9100](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9100))

### What's new in Pylint 3.0.0?

Release date: 2023-10-02

### Breaking Changes

  - Enabling or disabling individual messages will now take effect even if an `--enable=all` or `disable=all` follows in the same configuration file (or on the command line).
    
    This means for the following example, `fixme` messages will now be emitted:
    
        pylint my_module --enable=fixme --disable=all
    
    To regain the prior behavior, remove the superfluous earlier option.
    
    Closes \#3696 ([\#3696](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3696))

  - Remove support for launching pylint with Python 3.7. Code that supports Python 3.7 can still be linted with the `--py-version=3.7` setting.
    
    Refs \#6306 ([\#6306](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6306))

  - Disables placed in a `try` block now apply to the `except` block. Previously, they only happened to do so in the presence of an `else` clause.
    
    Refs \#7767 ([\#7767](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7767))

  - <span class="title-ref">pyreverse</span> now uses a new default color palette that is more colorblind friendly. The color scheme is taken from [Paul Tol's Notes](https://personal.sron.nl/~pault/). If you prefer other colors, you can use the <span class="title-ref">--color-palette</span> option to specify custom colors.
    
    Closes \#8251 ([\#8251](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8251))

  - Everything related to the `__implements__` construct was removed. It was based on PEP245 that was proposed in 2001 and rejected in 2006.
    
    The capability from pyreverse to take `__implements__` into account when generating diagrams was also removed.
    
    Refs \#8404 ([\#8404](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8404))

  - `pyreverse`: Support for the `.vcg` output format (Visualization of Compiler Graphs) has been dropped.
    
    Closes \#8416 ([\#8416](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8416))

  - The warning when the now useless old pylint cache directory (pylint.d) was found was removed. The cache dir is documented in [the FAQ](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/faq.html#where-is-the-persistent-data-stored-to-compare-between-successive-runs).
    
    Refs \#8462 ([\#8462](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8462))

  - Following a deprecation period, `pylint.config.PYLINTRC` was removed. Use the `pylint.config.find_default_config_files` generator instead.
    
    Closes \#8862 ([\#8862](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8862))

### Changes requiring user actions

  - The `invalid-name` message no longer checks for a minimum length of 3 characters by default. (This was an unadvertised commingling of concerns between casing and name length, and users regularly reported this to be surprising.)
    
    If checking for a minimum length is still desired, it can be regained in two ways:
    
      - If you are content with a `disallowed-name` message (instead of `invalid-name`), then simply add the option `bad-names-rgxs="^..?$"`, which will fail 1-2 character-long names. (Ensure you enable `disallowed-name`.)
      - If you would prefer an `invalid-name` message to be emitted, or would prefer finer-grained control over the circumstances in which messages are emitted (classes vs. methods, etc.), then avail yourself of the regex options described [here](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user_guide/configuration/all-options.html#main-checker). (In particular, take note of the commented out options in the "example configuration" given at the bottom of the section.) The prior regexes can be found in the [pull request](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/pull/8813) that removed the length requirements.
    
    Closes \#2018 ([\#2018](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2018))

  - The compare to empty string checker (`pylint.extensions.emptystring`) and the compare to zero checker (`pylint.extensions.compare-to-zero`) have been removed and their checks are now part of the implicit booleaness checker:
    
      - `compare-to-zero` was renamed `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-zero` and `compare-to-empty-string` was renamed `use-implicit-booleaness-not-comparison-to-string` and they now need to be enabled explicitly.
      - The `pylint.extensions.emptystring` and `pylint.extensions.compare-to-zero` extensions no longer exist and need to be removed from the `load-plugins` option.
      - Messages related to implicit booleaness were made more explicit and actionable. This permits to make their likeness explicit and will provide better performance as they share most of their conditions to be raised.
    
    Closes \#6871 ([\#6871](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/6871))

  - epylint was removed. It now lives at: <https://github.com/emacsorphanage/pylint>.
    
    Refs \#7737 ([\#7737](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7737))

  - The `overgeneral-exceptions` option now only takes fully qualified names into account (`builtins.Exception` not `Exception`). If you overrode this option, you need to use the fully qualified name now.
    
    There's still a warning, but it will be removed in 3.1.0.
    
    Refs \#8411 ([\#8411](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8411))

  - Following a deprecation period, it's no longer possible to use `MASTER` or `master` as configuration section in `setup.cfg` or `tox.ini`. It's bad practice to not start a section title with the tool name. Please use `pylint.main` instead.
    
    Refs \#8465 ([\#8465](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8465))

  - Package stats are now printed when running Pyreverse and a `--verbose` flag was added to get the original output with parsed modules. You might need to activate the verbose option if you want to keep the old output.
    
    Closes \#8973 ([\#8973](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8973))

### New Features

  - A new `json2` reporter has been added. It features a more enriched output that is easier to parse and provides more info.
    
    Compared to `json` the only changes are that messages are now under the `"messages"` key and that `"message-id"` now follows the camelCase convention and is renamed to `"messageId"`. The new reporter also reports the "score" of the modules you linted as defined by the `evaluation` option and provides statistics about the modules you linted.
    
    We encourage users to use the new reporter as the `json` reporter will no longer be maintained.
    
    Closes \#4741 ([\#4741](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4741))

  - In Pyreverse package dependency diagrams, show when a module imports another only for type-checking.
    
    Closes \#8112 ([\#8112](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8112))

  - Add new option (`--show-stdlib`, `-L`) to `pyreverse`. This is similar to the behavior of `--show-builtin` in that standard library modules are now not included by default, and this option will include them.
    
    Closes \#8181 ([\#8181](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8181))

  - Add Pyreverse option to exclude standalone nodes from diagrams with <span class="title-ref">--no-standalone</span>.
    
    Closes \#8476 ([\#8476](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8476))

### New Checks

  - Added `DataclassChecker` module and `invalid-field-call` checker to check for invalid dataclasses.field() usage.
    
    Refs \#5159 ([\#5159](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/5159))

  - Add `return-in-finally` to emit a message if a return statement was found in a finally clause.
    
    Closes \#8260 ([\#8260](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8260))

  - Add a new message `kwarg-superseded-by-positional-arg` to warn when a function is called with a keyword argument which shares a name with a positional-only parameter and the function contains a keyword variadic parameter dictionary. It may be surprising behaviour when the keyword argument is added to the keyword variadic parameter dictionary.
    
    Closes \#8558 ([\#8558](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8558))

### Extensions

  - Add new `prefer-typing-namedtuple` message to the `CodeStyleChecker` to suggest rewriting calls to `collections.namedtuple` as classes inheriting from `typing.NamedTuple` on Python 3.6+.
    
    Requires `load-plugins=pylint.extensions.code_style` and `enable=prefer-typing-namedtuple` to be raised.
    
    Closes \#8660 ([\#8660](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8660))

### False Positives Fixed

  - Extend concept of "function ambiguity" in `safe_infer()` from differing number of function arguments to differing set of argument names.
    
    Solves false positives in `tensorflow`.
    
    Closes \#3613 ([\#3613](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3613))

  - Fix <span class="title-ref">unused-argument</span> false positive when <span class="title-ref">\_\_new\_\_</span> does not use all the arguments of <span class="title-ref">\_\_init\_\_</span>.

    Refs \#7767 ([\#7767](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7767))

  - When checking for unbalanced dict unpacking in for-loops, Pylint will now test whether the length of each value to be unpacked matches the number of unpacking targets. Previously, Pylint would test the number of values for the loop iteration, which would produce a false unbalanced-dict-unpacking warning.
    
    Closes \#8156 ([\#8156](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8156))

  - Fix false positive for `used-before-assignment` when usage and assignment are guarded by the same test in different statements.
    
    Closes \#8167 ([\#8167](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8167))

  - Adds `asyncSetUp` to the default `defining-attr-methods` list to silence `attribute-defined-outside-init` warning when using `unittest.IsolatedAsyncioTestCase`.
    
    Refs \#8403 ([\#8403](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8403))

  - <span class="title-ref">logging-not-lazy</span> is not longer emitted for explicitly concatenated string arguments.

    Closes \#8424 ([\#8424](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8424))

  - `invalid-name` now allows for integers in `typealias` names:
    
      - now valid: `Good2Name`, `GoodName2`.
      - still invalid: `_1BadName`.
    
    Closes \#8485 ([\#8485](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8485))

  - No longer consider `Union` as type annotation as type alias for naming checks.
    
    Closes \#8487 ([\#8487](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8487))

  - `unnecessary-lambda` no longer warns on lambdas which use its parameters in their body (other than the final arguments), e.g. `lambda foo: (bar if foo else baz)(foo)`.
    
    Closes \#8496 ([\#8496](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8496))

  - Fixed <span class="title-ref">unused-import</span> so that it observes the <span class="title-ref">dummy-variables-rgx</span> option.
    
    Closes \#8500 ([\#8500](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8500))

  - <span class="title-ref">Union</span> typed variables without assignment are no longer treated as <span class="title-ref">TypeAlias</span>.
    
    Closes \#8540 ([\#8540](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8540))

  - Allow parenthesized implicitly concatenated strings when <span class="title-ref">check-str-concat-over-line-jumps</span> is enabled.
    
    Closes \#8552. ([\#8552](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8552))

  - Fix false positive for `positional-only-arguments-expected` when a function contains both a positional-only parameter that has a default value, and `**kwargs`.
    
    Closes \#8555 ([\#8555](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8555))

  - Fix false positive for `keyword-arg-before-vararg` when a positional-only parameter with a default value precedes `*args`.
    
    Closes \#8570 ([\#8570](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8570))

    Closes \#8919 ([\#8919](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8919))

  - Fix a false positive for `no-value-for-parameter` when a staticmethod is called in a class body.
    
    Closes \#9036 ([\#9036](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9036))

### False Negatives Fixed

  - Emit `used-before-assignment` when calling module-level functions before definition.
    
    Closes \#1144 ([\#1144](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1144))

  - Apply `infer_kwarg_from_call()` to more checks
    
    These mostly solve false negatives for various checks, save for one false positive for `use-maxsplit-arg`.
    
    Closes \#7761 ([\#7761](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7761))

  - <span class="title-ref">TypeAlias</span> variables defined in functions are now checked for <span class="title-ref">invalid-name</span> errors.
    
    Closes \#8536 ([\#8536](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8536))

  - Fix false negative for `no-value-for-parameter` when a function, whose signature contains both a positional-only parameter `name` and also `*kwargs`, is called with a keyword-argument for `name`.

  - Fix a false negative for `too-many-arguments` by considering positional-only and keyword-only parameters.
    
    Closes \#8667 ([\#8667](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8667))

  - Emit `assignment-from-no-return` for calls to builtin methods like `dict.update()`. Calls to `list.sort()` now raise `assignment-from-no-return` rather than `assignment-from-none` for consistency.
    
    Closes \#8714 Closes \#8810 ([\#8714](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8714))

  - `consider-using-augmented-assign` is now applied to dicts and lists as well.
    
    Closes \#8959. ([\#8959](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8959))

    Closes \#8789 ([\#8789](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8789))

### Internal Changes

  - `get_message_definition` was removed from the base checker API. You can access message definitions through the `MessageStore`.
    
    Refs \#8401 ([\#8401](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8401))

  - Everything related to the `__implements__` construct was removed. It was based on PEP245 that was proposed in 2001 and rejected in 2006.
    
    All the classes inheriting `Interface` in `pylint.interfaces` were removed. `Checker` should only inherit `BaseChecker` or any of the other checker types from `pylint.checkers`. `Reporter` should only inherit `BaseReporter`.
    
    Refs \#8404 ([\#8404](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8404))

  - `modname` and `msg_store` are now required to be given in `FileState`. `collect_block_lines` has also been removed. `Pylinter.current_name` cannot be null anymore.
    
    Refs \#8407 ([\#8407](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8407))

  - `Reporter.set_output` was removed in favor of `reporter.out = stream`.
    
    Refs \#8408 ([\#8408](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8408))

  - A number of old utility functions and classes have been removed:
    
    `MapReduceMixin`: To make a checker reduce map data simply implement `get_map_data` and `reduce_map_data`.
    
    `is_inside_lambda`: Use `utils.get_node_first_ancestor_of_type(x, nodes.Lambda)`
    
    `check_messages`: Use `utils.only_required_for_messages`
    
    `is_class_subscriptable_pep585_with_postponed_evaluation_enabled`: Use `is_postponed_evaluation_enabled(node)` and `is_node_in_type_annotation_context(node)`
    
    `get_python_path`: assumption that there's always an \_\_init\_\_.py is not true since python 3.3 and is causing problems, particularly with PEP 420. Use `discover_package_path` and pass source root(s).
    
    `fix_import_path`: Use `augmented_sys_path` and pass additional `sys.path` entries as an argument obtained from `discover_package_path`.
    
    `get_global_option`: Use `checker.linter.config` to get all global options.
    
    Related private objects have been removed as well.
    
    Refs \#8409 ([\#8409](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8409))

    Refs \#8463 ([\#8463](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8463))

  - Following a deprecation period, `ColorizedTextReporter` only accepts `ColorMappingDict`.
    
    Refs \#8464 ([\#8464](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8464))

  - Following a deprecation period, `MessageTest`'s `end_line` and `end_col_offset` must be accurate in functional tests (for python 3.8 or above on cpython, and for python 3.9 or superior on pypy).
    
    Refs \#8466 ([\#8466](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8466))

  - Following a deprecation period, the `do_exit` argument of the `Run` class (and of the `_Run` class in testutils) were removed.
    
    Refs \#8472 ([\#8472](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8472))

  - Following a deprecation period, the `py_version` argument of the `MessageDefinition.may_be_emitted` function is now required. The most likely solution is to use 'linter.config.py\_version' if you need to keep using this function, or to use 'MessageDefinition.is\_message\_enabled' instead.
    
    Refs \#8473 ([\#8473](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8473))

  - Following a deprecation period, the `OutputLine` class now requires the right number of argument all the time. The functional output can be regenerated automatically to achieve that easily.
    
    Refs \#8474 ([\#8474](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8474))

  - Following a deprecation period, `is_typing_guard`, `is_node_in_typing_guarded_import_block` and `is_node_in_guarded_import_block` from `pylint.utils` were removed: use a combination of `is_sys_guard` and `in_type_checking_block` instead.
    
    Refs \#8475 ([\#8475](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8475))

  - Following a deprecation period, the `location` argument of the `Message` class must now be a `MessageLocationTuple`.
    
    Refs \#8477 ([\#8477](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8477))

  - Following a deprecation period, the `check_single_file` function of the `Pylinter` is replaced by `Pylinter.check_single_file_item`.
    
    Refs \#8478 ([\#8478](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8478))

### Performance Improvements

  - `pylint` runs (at least) \~5% faster after improvements to `astroid` that make better use of the inference cache.
    
    Refs pylint-dev/astroid\#529 ([\#529](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/529))

  -   - Optimize `is_trailing_comma()`.
      - Cache `class_is_abstract()`.
    
    Refs \#1954 ([\#1954](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1954))

  - Exit immediately if all messages are disabled.
    
    Closes \#8715 ([\#8715](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8715))

# What's New in Pylint 3.1

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

</div>

  - Release  
    3.1

  - Date  
    2024-02-25

## Summary -- Release highlights

Two new checks -- `use-yield-from`, `deprecated-attribute` --and a smattering of bug fixes.

### What's new in Pylint 3.1.1?

Release date: 2024-05-13

### False Positives Fixed

  - Treat <span class="title-ref">attrs.define</span> and <span class="title-ref">attrs.frozen</span> as dataclass decorators in <span class="title-ref">too-few-public-methods</span> check.
    
    Closes \#9345 ([\#9345](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9345))

  - Fix a false positive with `singledispatchmethod-function` when a method is decorated with both `functools.singledispatchmethod` and `staticmethod`.
    
    Closes \#9531 ([\#9531](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9531))

  - Fix a false positive for `consider-using-dict-items` when iterating using `keys()` and then deleting an item using the key as a lookup.
    
    Closes \#9554 ([\#9554](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9554))

### What's new in Pylint 3.1.0?

Release date: 2024-02-25

### New Features

  - Skip `consider-using-join` check for non-empty separators if an `suggest-join-with-non-empty-separator` option is set to `no`.
    
    Closes \#8701 ([\#8701](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8701))

  - Discover `.pyi` files when linting.
    
    These can be ignored with the `ignore-patterns` setting.
    
    Closes \#9097 ([\#9097](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9097))

  - Check `TypeAlias` and `TypeVar` (PEP 695) nodes for `invalid-name`.
    
    Refs \#9196 ([\#9196](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9196))

  - Support for resolving external toml files named pylintrc.toml and .pylintrc.toml.
    
    Closes \#9228 ([\#9228](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9228))

  - Check for <span class="title-ref">.clear</span>, <span class="title-ref">.discard</span>, <span class="title-ref">.pop</span> and <span class="title-ref">remove</span> methods being called on a set while it is being iterated over.
    
    Closes \#9334 ([\#9334](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9334))

### New Checks

  - New message <span class="title-ref">use-yield-from</span> added to the refactoring checker. This message is emitted when yielding from a loop can be replaced by <span class="title-ref">yield from</span>.
    
    Closes \#9229. ([\#9229](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9229))

  - Added a `deprecated-attribute` message to check deprecated attributes in the stdlib.
    
    Closes \#8855 ([\#8855](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8855))

### False Positives Fixed

  - Fixed false positive for `inherit-non-class` for generic Protocols.
    
    Closes \#9106 ([\#9106](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9106))

  - Exempt `TypedDict` from `typing_extensions` from `too-many-ancestor` checks.
    
    Refs \#9167 ([\#9167](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9167))

    Closes \#8827 ([\#8827](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8827))

  - Fix a false-negative for unnecessary if blocks using a different than expected ordering of arguments.
    
    Closes \#8947. ([\#8947](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8947))

### Other Bug Fixes

  - Improve the message provided for wrong-import-order check. Instead of the import statement ("import x"), the message now specifies the import that is out of order and which imports should come after it. As reported in the issue, this is particularly helpful if there are multiple imports on a single line that do not follow the PEP8 convention.
    
    The message will report imports as follows: For "import X", it will report "(standard/third party/first party/local) import X" For "import X.Y" and "from X import Y", it will report "(standard/third party/first party/local) import X.Y" The import category is specified to provide explanation as to why pylint has issued the message and guidance to the developer on how to fix the problem.
    
    Closes \#8808 ([\#8808](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8808))

### Other Changes

  - Print how many files were checked in verbose mode.
    
    Closes \#8935 ([\#8935](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8935))

  - Fix a crash when an enum class which is also decorated with a `dataclasses.dataclass` decorator is defined.
    
    Closes \#9100 ([\#9100](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9100))

### Internal Changes

  - Update astroid version to 3.1.0.
    
    Refs \#9457 ([\#9457](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9457))

    Closes \#8866 ([\#8866](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/8866))

  - Fixed a crash when the `start` value in an `enumerate` was non-constant and impossible to infer (like in`enumerate(apples, start=int(random_apple_index)`) for `unnecessary-list-index-lookup`.
    
    Closes \#9078 ([\#9078](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9078))

  - Fixed a crash in `symilar` when the `-d` or `-i` short option were not properly recognized. It's still impossible to do `-d=1` (you must do `-d 1`).

  - Fix a false positive for `redefined-outer-name` when there is a name defined in an exception-handling block which shares the same name as a local variable that has been defined in a function body.
    
    Closes \#9671 ([\#9671](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9671))

  - Fix a false positive for `use-yield-from` when using the return value from the `yield` atom.
    
    Closes \#9696 ([\#9696](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9696))

### What's new in Pylint 3.2.2?

Release date: 2024-05-20

### What's new in Pylint 3.2.1?

Release date: 2024-05-18

    Closes \#9643 ([\#9643](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9643))

### Other Bug Fixes

  - Fix a false negative for `--ignore-patterns` when the directory to be linted is specified using a dot(`.`) and all files are ignored instead of only the files whose name begin with a dot.
    
    Closes \#9273 ([\#9273](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9273))

  - Restore "errors / warnings by module" section to report output (with <span class="title-ref">-ry</span>).
    
    Closes \#9145 ([\#9145](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9145))

  - `trailing-comma-tuple` should now be correctly emitted when it was disabled globally but enabled via local message control, after removal of an over-optimisation.
    
    Refs \#9608. ([\#9608](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9608))

  - Add <span class="title-ref">--prefer-stubs=yes</span> option to opt-in to the astroid 3.2 feature that prefers <span class="title-ref">.pyi</span> stubs over same-named <span class="title-ref">.py</span> files. This has the potential to reduce <span class="title-ref">no-member</span> errors but at the cost of more errors such as <span class="title-ref">not-an-iterable</span> from function bodies appearing as <span class="title-ref">...</span>.
    
    Defaults to <span class="title-ref">no</span>.
    
    Closes \#9626 Closes \#9623 ([\#9626](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9626))

### Internal Changes

  - Update astroid version to 3.2.1. This solves some reports of `RecursionError` and also makes the *prefer .pyi stubs* feature in astroid 3.2.0 *opt-in* with the aforementioned `--prefer-stubs=y` option.
    
    Refs \#9139 ([\#9139](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9139))

### What's new in Pylint 3.2.0?

Release date: 2024-05-14

### New Features

  - Understand <span class="title-ref">six.PY2</span> and <span class="title-ref">six.PY3</span> for conditional imports.
    
    Closes \#3501 ([\#3501](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/3501))

  - A new <span class="title-ref">github</span> reporter has been added. This reporter returns the output of <span class="title-ref">pylint</span> in a format that Github can use to automatically annotate code. Use it with <span class="title-ref">pylint --output-format=github</span> on your Github Workflows.
    
    Closes \#9443. ([\#9443](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9443))

### New Checks

  - Add check `possibly-used-before-assignment` when relying on names after an `if/else` switch when one branch failed to define the name, raise, or return.
    
    Closes \#1727 ([\#1727](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/1727))

  - Checks for generators that use contextmanagers that don't handle cleanup properly. Is meant to raise visibility on the case that a generator is not fully exhausted and the contextmanager is not cleaned up properly. A contextmanager must yield a non-constant value and not handle cleanup for GeneratorExit. The using generator must attempt to use the yielded context value <span class="title-ref">with x() as y</span> and not just <span class="title-ref">with x()</span>.
    
    Closes \#2832 ([\#2832](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/2832))

### False Negatives Fixed

  - If and Try nodes are now checked for useless return statements as well.
    
    Closes \#9449. ([\#9449](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9449))

  - Fix false negative for `property-with-parameters` in the case of parameters which are `positional-only`, `keyword-only`, `variadic positional` or `variadic keyword`.
    
    Closes \#9584 ([\#9584](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9584))

### False Positives Fixed

pylint now understands the `@overload` decorator return values better.

Closes \#4696 ([\#4696](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/4696)) Refs \#9606 ([\#9606](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9606))

### Performance Improvements

  - Ignored modules are now not checked at all, instead of being checked and then ignored. This should speed up the analysis of large codebases which have ignored modules.
    
    Closes \#9442 ([\#9442](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9442)) ([\#9442](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9442))

  - ImportChecker's logic has been modified to avoid context files when possible. This makes it possible to cache module searches on astroid and reduce execution times.
    
    Refs \#9310. ([\#9310](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9310))

  - An internal check for `trailing-comma-tuple` being enabled for a file or not is now done once per file instead of once for each token.
    
    Refs \#9608. ([\#9608](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9608))

# What's New in Pylint 3.3

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

</div>

:Release:3.3 :Date: 2024-09-20

## Summary -- Release highlights

### What's new in Pylint 3.3.1?

Release date: 2024-09-24

### False Positives Fixed

  - Fix regression causing some f-strings to not be inferred as strings.
    
    Closes \#9947 ([\#9947](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9947))

### What's new in Pylint 3.3.0?

Release date: 2024-09-20

### Changes requiring user actions

  - We migrated `symilar` to argparse, from getopt, so the error and help output changed (for the better). We exit with 2 instead of sometime 1, sometime 2. The error output is not captured by the runner anymore. It's not possible to use a value for the boolean options anymore (`--ignore-comments 1` should become `--ignore-comments`).
    
    Refs \#9731 ([\#9731](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9731))

### New Features

  - Add new <span class="title-ref">declare-non-slot</span> error which reports when a class has a <span class="title-ref">\_\_slots\_\_</span> member and a type hint on the class is not present in <span class="title-ref">\_\_slots\_\_</span>.
    
    Refs \#9499 ([\#9499](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9499))

### New Checks

  - Added <span class="title-ref">too-many-positional-arguments</span> to allow distinguishing the configuration for too many total arguments (with keyword-only params specified after <span class="title-ref">\*</span>) from the configuration for too many positional-or-keyword or positional-only arguments.
    
    As part of evaluating whether this check makes sense for your project, ensure you adjust the value of <span class="title-ref">--max-positional-arguments</span>.
    
    Closes \#9099 ([\#9099](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9099))

  - Add <span class="title-ref">using-exception-groups-in-unsupported-version</span> and <span class="title-ref">using-generic-type-syntax-in-unsupported-version</span> for uses of Python 3.11+ or 3.12+ features on lower supported versions provided with <span class="title-ref">--py-version</span>.
    
    Closes \#9791 ([\#9791](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9791))

  - Add <span class="title-ref">using-assignment-expression-in-unsupported-version</span> for uses of <span class="title-ref">:=</span> (walrus operator) on Python versions below 3.8 provided with <span class="title-ref">--py-version</span>.
    
    Closes \#9820 ([\#9820](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9820))

  - Add <span class="title-ref">using-positional-only-args-in-unsupported-version</span> for uses of positional-only args on Python versions below 3.8 provided with <span class="title-ref">--py-version</span>.
    
    Closes \#9823 ([\#9823](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9823))

  - Add `unnecessary-default-type-args` to the `typing` extension to detect the use of unnecessary default type args for `typing.Generator` and `typing.AsyncGenerator`.
    
    Refs \#9938 ([\#9938](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9938))

### False Negatives Fixed

  - Fix computation of never-returning function: <span class="title-ref">Never</span> is handled in addition to <span class="title-ref">NoReturn</span>, and priority is given to the explicit <span class="title-ref">--never-returning-functions</span> option.
    
    Closes \#7565. ([\#7565](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/7565))

  - Fix a false negative for <span class="title-ref">await-outside-async</span> when await is inside Lambda.
    
    Refs \#9653 ([\#9653](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9653))

  - Fix a false negative for `duplicate-argument-name` by including `positional-only`, `*args` and `**kwargs` arguments in the check.
    
    Closes \#9669 ([\#9669](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9669))

  - Fix false negative for <span class="title-ref">multiple-statements</span> when multiple statements are present on <span class="title-ref">else</span> and <span class="title-ref">finally</span> lines of <span class="title-ref">try</span>.
    
    Refs \#9759 ([\#9759](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9759))

  - Fix false negatives when <span class="title-ref">isinstance</span> does not have exactly two arguments. pylint now emits a <span class="title-ref">too-many-function-args</span> or <span class="title-ref">no-value-for-parameter</span> appropriately for <span class="title-ref">isinstance</span> calls.
    
    Closes \#9847 ([\#9847](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9847))

### Other Bug Fixes

  - <span class="title-ref">--enable</span> with <span class="title-ref">--disable=all</span> now produces an error, when an unknown msg code is used. Internal <span class="title-ref">pylint</span> messages are no longer affected by <span class="title-ref">--disable=all</span>.
    
    Closes \#9403 ([\#9403](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9403))

  - Impossible to compile regexes for paths in the configuration or argument given to pylint won't crash anymore but raise an argparse error and display the error message from `re.compile` instead.
    
    Closes \#9680 ([\#9680](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9680))

  - Fix a bug where a `tox.ini` file with pylint configuration was ignored and it exists in the current directory.
    
    `.cfg` and `.ini` files containing a `Pylint` configuration may now use a section named `[pylint]`. This enhancement impacts the scenario where these file types are used as defaults when they are present and have not been explicitly referred to, using the `--rcfile` option.
    
    Closes \#9727 ([\#9727](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9727))

  - Improve file discovery for directories that are not python packages.
    
    Closes \#9764 ([\#9764](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/issues/9764))

### Other Changes

  - Remove support for launching pylint with Python 3.8. Code that supports Python 3.8 can still be linted with the `--py-version=3.8` setting.

full_changelog_explanation.md

From pylint's beginning to pylint 2.14.0 included, we had a changelog that contained *all* nontrivial changes to Pylint, including changes that were not user facing, i.e. change that might interest you only if you're a developer working on pylint or pylint plugins or an open-source historian.

# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a
harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or
invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance,
race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse,
inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community
include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and
  learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any
  kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without
  their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional
  setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to
any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments,
commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this
Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an
individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of
representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an
official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or
offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to
the community leaders responsible for enforcement at pierre.sassoulas at gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter
of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the
consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity
around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was
inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with
the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of
Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in
community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms
may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained
inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication
with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with
the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of
Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent
ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards,
including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression
toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
community.

What is Pylint?
---------------

Pylint is a [static code analyser](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_code_analysis) for Python 2 or 3. The latest version supports Python 3.9.0 and above.

Pylint analyses your code without actually running it. It checks for errors, enforces a coding standard, looks for [code smells](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html), and can make suggestions about how the code could be refactored.

Install
-------

For command line use, pylint is installed with:

    pip install pylint

Or if you want to also check spelling with `enchant` (you might need to [install the enchant C library](https://pyenchant.github.io/pyenchant/install.html#installing-the-enchant-c-library)):

``` {.sh}
pip install pylint[spelling]
```

It can also be integrated in most editors or IDEs. More information can be found [in the documentation](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user_guide/installation/index.html).

What differentiates Pylint?
---------------------------

Pylint is not trusting your typing and is inferring the actual values of nodes (for a start because there was no typing when pylint started off) using its internal code representation (astroid). If your code is `import logging as argparse`, Pylint can check and know that `argparse.error(...)` is in fact a logging call and not an argparse call. This makes pylint slower, but it also lets pylint find more issues if your code is not fully typed.

> \[inference\] is the killer feature that keeps us using \[pylint\] in our project despite how painfully slow it is. - [Realist pylint user](https://github.com/charliermarsh/ruff/issues/970#issuecomment-1381067064), 2022

pylint, not afraid of being a little slower than it already is, is also a lot more thorough than other linters. There are more checks, including some opinionated ones that are deactivated by default but can be enabled using configuration.

How to use pylint
-----------------

Pylint isn\'t smarter than you: it may warn you about things that you have conscientiously done or check for some things that you don\'t care about. During adoption, especially in a legacy project where pylint was never enforced, it\'s best to start with the `--errors-only` flag, then disable convention and refactor messages with `--disable=C,R` and progressively re-evaluate and re-enable messages as your priorities evolve.

Pylint is highly configurable and permits to write plugins in order to add your own checks (for example, for internal libraries or an internal rule). Pylint also has an ecosystem of existing plugins for popular frameworks and third-party libraries.

::: {.note}
::: {.title}
Note
:::

Pylint supports the Python standard library out of the box. Third-party libraries are not always supported, so a plugin might be needed. A good place to start is `PyPI` which often returns a plugin by searching for `pylint <library>`. [pylint-pydantic](https://pypi.org/project/pylint-pydantic), [pylint-django](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint-django) and [pylint-sonarjson](https://github.com/cnescatlab/pylint-sonarjson-catlab) are examples of such plugins. More information about plugins and how to load them can be found at [plugins](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/how_tos/plugins.html#plugins).
:::

Advised linters alongside pylint
--------------------------------

Projects that you might want to use alongside pylint include [ruff](https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff) (**really** fast, with builtin auto-fix and a large number of checks taken from popular linters, but implemented in `rust`) or [flake8](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8) (a framework to implement your own checks in python using `ast` directly), [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy), [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright) / pylance or [pyre](https://github.com/facebook/pyre-check) (typing checks), [bandit](https://github.com/PyCQA/bandit) (security oriented checks), [black](https://github.com/psf/black) and [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) (auto-formatting), [autoflake](https://github.com/myint/autoflake) (automated removal of unused imports or variables), [pyupgrade](https://github.com/asottile/pyupgrade) (automated upgrade to newer python syntax) and [pydocstringformatter](https://github.com/DanielNoord/pydocstringformatter) (automated pep257).

Additional tools included in pylint
-----------------------------------

Pylint ships with two additional tools:

-   [pyreverse](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/pyreverse/index.html) (standalone tool that generates package and class diagrams.)
-   [symilar](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/additional_tools/symilar/index.html) (duplicate code finder that is also integrated in pylint)

Contributing
------------

We welcome all forms of contributions such as updates for documentation, new code, checking issues for duplicates or telling us that we can close them, confirming that issues still exist, [creating issues because you found a bug or want a feature](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/contact.html#bug-reports-feedback), etc. Everything is much appreciated!

Please follow the [code of conduct](https://github.com/pylint-dev/pylint/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and check [the Contributor Guides](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/latest/development_guide/contribute.html) if you want to make a code contribution.
