README.md

The documentation in this tree is in plain text files and can be viewed using any text file viewer.

It uses [ReST](https://docutils.sourceforge.io/rst.html) (reStructuredText), and the [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) documentation system. This allows it to be built into other forms for easier viewing and browsing.

To create an HTML version of the docs:

  - Install Sphinx (using `python -m pip install Sphinx` or some other method).
  - In this docs/ directory, type `make html` (or `make.bat html` on Windows) at a shell prompt.

The documentation in `_build/html/index.html` can then be viewed in a web browser.

Contributing to Django
======================

As an open source project, Django welcomes contributions of many forms.

Examples of contributions include:

-   Code patches
-   Documentation improvements
-   Bug reports and patch reviews

Extensive contribution guidelines are available in the repository at `docs/internals/contributing/`, or online at:

<https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/>

**Warning: non-trivial pull requests (anything more than fixing a typo) without Trac tickets will be closed!** [Please file a ticket](https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket) to suggest changes.

Django uses Trac to keep track of bugs, feature requests, and associated patches because GitHub doesn\'t provide adequate tooling for its community. Patches can be submitted as pull requests, but if you don\'t file a ticket, it\'s unlikely that we\'ll notice your contribution.

Code of Conduct
---------------

As a contributor, you can help us keep the Django community open and inclusive. Please read and follow our [Code of Conduct](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/).

Django
======

Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Thanks for checking it out.

All documentation is in the \"`docs`\" directory and online at <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/stable/>. If you\'re just getting started, here\'s how we recommend you read the docs:

-   First, read `docs/intro/install.txt` for instructions on installing Django.
-   Next, work through the tutorials in order (`docs/intro/tutorial01.txt`, `docs/intro/tutorial02.txt`, etc.).
-   If you want to set up an actual deployment server, read `docs/howto/deployment/index.txt` for instructions.
-   You\'ll probably want to read through the topical guides (in `docs/topics`) next; from there you can jump to the HOWTOs (in `docs/howto`) for specific problems, and check out the reference (`docs/ref`) for gory details.
-   See `docs/README` for instructions on building an HTML version of the docs.

Docs are updated rigorously. If you find any problems in the docs, or think they should be clarified in any way, please take 30 seconds to fill out a ticket here: <https://code.djangoproject.com/newticket>

To get more help:

-   Join the `#django` channel on `irc.libera.chat`. Lots of helpful people hang out there. [Webchat is available](https://web.libera.chat/#django).
-   Join the django-users mailing list, or read the archives, at <https://groups.google.com/group/django-users>.
-   Join the [Django Discord community](https://discord.gg/xcRH6mN4fa).
-   Join the community on the [Django Forum](https://forum.djangoproject.com/).

To run Django\'s test suite:

-   Follow the instructions in the \"Unit tests\" section of `docs/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests.txt`, published online at <https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/internals/contributing/writing-code/unit-tests/#running-the-unit-tests>
