# Developer Interface

<div class="module">

requests

</div>

This part of the documentation covers all the interfaces of Requests. For parts where Requests depends on external libraries, we document the most important right here and provide links to the canonical documentation.

## Main Interface

All of Requests' functionality can be accessed by these 7 methods. They all return an instance of the <span class="title-ref">Response \<Response\></span> object.

## Migrating to 1.x

This section details the main differences between 0.x and 1.x and is meant to ease the pain of upgrading.

### API Changes

  - `Response.json` is now a callable and not a property of a response.
    
        import requests
        r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
        r.json()   # This *call* raises an exception if JSON decoding fails

  - The `Session` API has changed. Sessions objects no longer take parameters. `Session` is also now capitalized, but it can still be instantiated with a lowercase `session` for backwards compatibility.
    
        s = requests.Session()    # formerly, session took parameters
        s.auth = auth
        s.headers.update(headers)
        r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/headers')

  - All request hooks have been removed except 'response'.

  - Authentication helpers have been broken out into separate modules. See [requests-oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib) and [requests-kerberos](https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos).

  - The parameter for streaming requests was changed from `prefetch` to `stream` and the logic was inverted. In addition, `stream` is now required for raw response reading.
    
        # in 0.x, passing prefetch=False would accomplish the same thing
        r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream=True)
        for chunk in r.iter_content(8192):
            ...

  - The `config` parameter to the requests method has been removed. Some of these options are now configured on a `Session` such as keep-alive and maximum number of redirects. The verbosity option should be handled by configuring logging.
    
        import requests
        import logging
        
        # Enabling debugging at http.client level (requests->urllib3->http.client)
        # you will see the REQUEST, including HEADERS and DATA, and RESPONSE with HEADERS but without DATA.
        # the only thing missing will be the response.body which is not logged.
        try: # for Python 3
            from http.client import HTTPConnection
        except ImportError:
            from httplib import HTTPConnection
        HTTPConnection.debuglevel = 1
        
        logging.basicConfig() # you need to initialize logging, otherwise you will not see anything from requests
        logging.getLogger().setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        requests_log = logging.getLogger("urllib3")
        requests_log.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
        requests_log.propagate = True
        
        requests.get('https://httpbin.org/headers')

### Licensing

One key difference that has nothing to do with the API is a change in the license from the [ISC](https://opensource.org/licenses/ISC) license to the [Apache 2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) license. The Apache 2.0 license ensures that contributions to Requests are also covered by the Apache 2.0 license.

## Migrating to 2.x

Compared with the 1.0 release, there were relatively few backwards incompatible changes, but there are still a few issues to be aware of with this major release.

For more details on the changes in this release including new APIs, links to the relevant GitHub issues and some of the bug fixes, read Cory's [blog](https://lukasa.co.uk/2013/09/Requests_20/) on the subject.

### API Changes

  - There were a couple changes to how Requests handles exceptions. `RequestException` is now a subclass of `IOError` rather than `RuntimeError` as that more accurately categorizes the type of error. In addition, an invalid URL escape sequence now raises a subclass of `RequestException` rather than a `ValueError`.
    
        requests.get('http://%zz/')   # raises requests.exceptions.InvalidURL
    
    Lastly, `httplib.IncompleteRead` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked encoding will now raise a Requests `ChunkedEncodingError` instead.

  - The proxy API has changed slightly. The scheme for a proxy URL is now required.
    
        proxies = {
          "http": "10.10.1.10:3128",    # use http://10.10.1.10:3128 instead
        }
        
        # In requests 1.x, this was legal, in requests 2.x,
        #  this raises requests.exceptions.MissingSchema
        requests.get("http://example.org", proxies=proxies)

### Behavioural Changes

  - Keys in the `headers` dictionary are now native strings on all Python versions, i.e. bytestrings on Python 2 and unicode on Python 3. If the keys are not native strings (unicode on Python 2 or bytestrings on Python 3) they will be converted to the native string type assuming UTF-8 encoding.
  - Values in the `headers` dictionary should always be strings. This has been the project's position since before 1.0 but a recent change (since version 2.11.0) enforces this more strictly. It's advised to avoid passing header values as unicode when possible.

# Frequently Asked Questions

This part of the documentation answers common questions about Requests.

## Encoded Data?

Requests automatically decompresses gzip-encoded responses, and does its best to decode response content to unicode when possible.

When either the [brotli](https://pypi.org/project/Brotli/) or [brotlicffi](https://pypi.org/project/brotlicffi/) package is installed, requests also decodes Brotli-encoded responses.

You can get direct access to the raw response (and even the socket), if needed as well.

## Custom User-Agents?

Requests allows you to easily override User-Agent strings, along with any other HTTP Header. See \[documentation about headers \<custom-headers\>\](\#documentation-about-headers-\<custom-headers\>).

## Why not Httplib2?

Chris Adams gave an excellent summary on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=2884406):

> httplib2 is part of why you should use requests: it's far more respectable as a client but not as well documented and it still takes way too much code for basic operations. I appreciate what httplib2 is trying to do, that there's a ton of hard low-level annoyances in building a modern HTTP client, but really, just use requests instead. Kenneth Reitz is very motivated and he gets the degree to which simple things should be simple whereas httplib2 feels more like an academic exercise than something people should use to build production systems\[1\].
> 
> Disclosure: I'm listed in the requests AUTHORS file but can claim credit for, oh, about 0.0001% of the awesomeness.
> 
> 1\. <http://code.google.com/p/httplib2/issues/detail?id=96> is a good example: an annoying bug which affect many people, there was a fix available for months, which worked great when I applied it in a fork and pounded a couple TB of data through it, but it took over a year to make it into trunk and even longer to make it onto PyPI where any other project which required " httplib2" would get the working version.

## Python 3 Support?

Yes\! Requests officially supports Python 3.8+ and PyPy.

## Python 2 Support?

No\! As of Requests 2.28.0, Requests no longer supports Python 2.7. Users who have been unable to migrate should pin to <span class="title-ref">requests\<2.28</span>. Full information can be found in [psf/requests\#6023](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/6023).

It is *highly* recommended users migrate to Python 3.8+ now since Python 2.7 is no longer receiving bug fixes or security updates as of January 1, 2020.

## What are "hostname doesn't match" errors?

These errors occur when \[SSL certificate verification \<verification\>\](\#ssl-certificate-verification-\<verification\>) fails to match the certificate the server responds with to the hostname Requests thinks it's contacting. If you're certain the server's SSL setup is correct (for example, because you can visit the site with your browser) and you're using Python 2.7, a possible explanation is that you need Server-Name-Indication.

[Server-Name-Indication](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication), or SNI, is an official extension to SSL where the client tells the server what hostname it is contacting. This is important when servers are using [Virtual Hosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_hosting). When such servers are hosting more than one SSL site they need to be able to return the appropriate certificate based on the hostname the client is connecting to.

Python 3 already includes native support for SNI in their SSL modules.

# Recommended Packages and Extensions

Requests has a great variety of powerful and useful third-party extensions. This page provides an overview of some of the best of them.

## Certifi CA Bundle

[Certifi](https://github.com/certifi/python-certifi) is a carefully curated collection of Root Certificates for validating the trustworthiness of SSL certificates while verifying the identity of TLS hosts. It has been extracted from the Requests project.

## CacheControl

[CacheControl](https://cachecontrol.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) is an extension that adds a full HTTP cache to Requests. This makes your web requests substantially more efficient, and should be used whenever you're making a lot of web requests.

## Requests-Toolbelt

[Requests-Toolbelt](https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) is a collection of utilities that some users of Requests may desire, but do not belong in Requests proper. This library is actively maintained by members of the Requests core team, and reflects the functionality most requested by users within the community.

## Requests-Threads

[Requests-Threads](https://github.com/requests/requests-threads) is a Requests session that returns the amazing Twisted's awaitable Deferreds instead of Response objects. This allows the use of `async`/`await` keyword usage on Python 3, or Twisted's style of programming, if desired.

## Requests-OAuthlib

[requests-oauthlib](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) makes it possible to do the OAuth dance from Requests automatically. This is useful for the large number of websites that use OAuth to provide authentication. It also provides a lot of tweaks that handle ways that specific OAuth providers differ from the standard specifications.

## Betamax

[Betamax](https://github.com/betamaxpy/betamax) records your HTTP interactions so the NSA does not have to. A VCR imitation designed only for Python-Requests.

# Release Process and Rules

<div class="versionadded">

v2.6.2

</div>

Starting with the version to be released after `v2.6.2`, the following rules will govern and describe how the Requests core team produces a new release.

## Major Releases

A major release will include breaking changes. When it is versioned, it will be versioned as `vX.0.0`. For example, if the previous release was `v10.2.7` the next version will be `v11.0.0`.

Breaking changes are changes that break backwards compatibility with prior versions. If the project were to change the `text` attribute on a `Response` object to a method, that would only happen in a Major release.

Major releases may also include miscellaneous bug fixes. The core developers of Requests are committed to providing a good user experience. This means we're also committed to preserving backwards compatibility as much as possible. Major releases will be infrequent and will need strong justifications before they are considered.

## Minor Releases

A minor release will not include breaking changes but may include miscellaneous bug fixes. If the previous version of Requests released was `v10.2.7` a minor release would be versioned as `v10.3.0`.

Minor releases will be backwards compatible with releases that have the same major version number. In other words, all versions that would start with `v10.` should be compatible with each other.

## Hotfix Releases

A hotfix release will only include bug fixes that were missed when the project released the previous version. If the previous version of Requests released `v10.2.7` the hotfix release would be versioned as `v10.2.8`.

Hotfixes will **not** include upgrades to vendored dependencies after `v2.6.2`

## Reasoning

In the 2.5 and 2.6 release series, the Requests core team upgraded vendored dependencies and caused a great deal of headaches for both users and the core team. To reduce this pain, we're forming a concrete set of procedures so expectations will be properly set.

# Release History

## dev

  - \[Short description of non-trivial change.\]

## 2.32.3 (2024-05-29)

**Bugfixes** - Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts in sub-classes of HTTPAdapter. (\#6716) - Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python versions compiled without the <span class="title-ref">ssl</span> module. (\#6724)

## 2.32.2 (2024-05-21)

**Deprecations** - To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we've renamed <span class="title-ref">\_get\_connection</span> to a new public API, <span class="title-ref">get\_connection\_with\_tls\_context</span>. Existing custom HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API. <span class="title-ref">get\_connection</span> is considered deprecated in all versions of Requests\>=2.32.0.

> A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to ease migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their custom adapter is subject to the same issue described in CVE-2024-35195. (\#6710)

## 2.32.1 (2024-05-20)

**Bugfixes** - Add missing test certs to the sdist distributed on PyPI.

## 2.32.0 (2024-05-20)

**Security** - Fixed an issue where setting <span class="title-ref">verify=False</span> on the first request from a Session will cause subsequent requests to the \_same [origin]() to also ignore cert verification, regardless of the value of <span class="title-ref">verify</span>. (<https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56>)

**Improvements** - <span class="title-ref">verify=True</span> now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (\#6667) - Requests now supports optional use of character detection (<span class="title-ref">chardet</span> or <span class="title-ref">charset\_normalizer</span>) when repackaged or vendored. This enables <span class="title-ref">pip</span> and other projects to minimize their vendoring surface area. The <span class="title-ref">Response.text()</span> and <span class="title-ref">apparent\_encoding</span> APIs will default to <span class="title-ref">utf-8</span> if neither library is present. (\#6702)

**Bugfixes** - Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly calculated in the request content-length. (\#6589) - Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (\#6629) - Fixed bug where an extra leading <span class="title-ref">/</span> (path separator) could lead urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (\#6644)

**Deprecations**

  - Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (\#6503)
  - Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (\#6641)
  - Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (\#6642)
  - Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (\#6641)

**Documentation** - Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

**Packaging** - Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices. The source files for the projects (formerly <span class="title-ref">requests</span>) is now located in <span class="title-ref">src/requests</span> in the Requests sdist. (\#6506) - Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system using <span class="title-ref">hatchling</span>. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.

## 2.31.0 (2023-05-22)

**Security** - Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential forwarding of <span class="title-ref">Proxy-Authorization</span> headers to destination servers when following HTTPS redirects.

> When proxies are defined with user info (<span class="title-ref">https://user:pass@proxy:8080</span>), Requests will construct a <span class="title-ref">Proxy-Authorization</span> header that is attached to the request to authenticate with the proxy.
> 
> In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached the <span class="title-ref">Proxy-Authorization</span> header incorrectly, resulting in the value being sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy credentials once the change has been fully deployed.
> 
> Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this vulnerability.
> 
> Full details can be read in our \[Github Security Advisory\](<https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q>) and \[CVE-2023-32681\](<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681>).

## 2.30.0 (2023-05-03)

**Dependencies** - ⚠️ Added support for urllib3 2.0. ⚠️

> This may contain minor breaking changes so we advise careful testing and reviewing <https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html> prior to upgrading.
> 
> Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to <span class="title-ref">urllib3\<2</span>.

## 2.29.0 (2023-04-26)

**Improvements**

  - Requests now defers chunked requests to the urllib3 implementation to improve standardization. (\#6226)
  - Requests relaxes header component requirements to support bytes/str subclasses. (\#6356)

## 2.28.2 (2023-01-12)

**Dependencies**

  - Requests now supports charset\_normalizer 3.x. (\#6261)

**Bugfixes**

  - Updated MissingSchema exception to suggest https scheme rather than http. (\#6188)

## 2.28.1 (2022-06-29)

**Improvements**

  - Speed optimization in <span class="title-ref">iter\_content</span> with transition to <span class="title-ref">yield from</span>. (\#6170)

**Dependencies**

  - Added support for chardet 5.0.0 (\#6179)
  - Added support for charset-normalizer 2.1.0 (\#6169)

## 2.28.0 (2022-06-09)

**Deprecations**

  - ⚠️ Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. ⚠️ (\#6091)
  - Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3.6). (\#6091)

**Improvements**

  - Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request's JSONDecodeError for payloads without an encoding to make <span class="title-ref">json()</span> API consistent. (\#6097)
  - Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in all invalid cases. (\#6154)
  - Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (\#6155)
  - Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (\#6095)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed bug where setting <span class="title-ref">CURL\_CA\_BUNDLE</span> to an empty string would disable cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (\#6074)
  - Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping <span class="title-ref">urllib3.exceptions.SSLError</span> with <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.SSLError</span> for <span class="title-ref">content</span> and <span class="title-ref">iter\_content</span>. (\#6057)
  - Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entries caused proxy resolution to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (\#6149)
  - Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for JSONDecodeError. (\#6036)

## 2.27.1 (2022-01-05)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed parsing issue that resulted in the <span class="title-ref">auth</span> component being dropped from proxy URLs. (\#6028)

## 2.27.0 (2022-01-03)

**Improvements**

  - Officially added support for Python 3.10. (\#5928)
  - Added a <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError</span> to unify JSON exceptions between Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the <span class="title-ref">response.json()</span> method, and is backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions. Can be caught from <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.RequestException</span> as well. (\#5856)
  - Improved error text for misnamed <span class="title-ref">InvalidSchema</span> and <span class="title-ref">MissingSchema</span> exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed (Schema-\>Scheme). (\#6017)
  - Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address recent changes to <span class="title-ref">urlparse</span> in Python 3.9+. (\#5917)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed defect in <span class="title-ref">extract\_zipped\_paths</span> which could result in an infinite loop for some paths. (\#5851)
  - Fixed handling for <span class="title-ref">AttributeError</span> when calculating length of files obtained by <span class="title-ref">Tarfile.extractfile()</span>. (\#5239)
  - Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping <span class="title-ref">urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader</span> with <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader</span>. (\#5914)
  - Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (\#5391)
  - Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where <span class="title-ref">Proxy-Authorization</span> was incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with <span class="title-ref">Session.send</span>. (\#5924)
  - Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of proxies available in the environment. (\#5924)
  - Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping <span class="title-ref">UnicodeError</span> with <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.InvalidURL</span> for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the domain. (\#5414)

**Deprecations**

  - Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release series providing support.

## 2.26.0 (2021-07-13)

**Improvements**

  - Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the <span class="title-ref">brotli</span> or <span class="title-ref">brotlicffi</span> package is installed. (\#5783)
  - <span class="title-ref">Session.send</span> now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both the Session and Request. Behavior now matches <span class="title-ref">Session.request</span>. (\#5681)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel from zip archive. (\#5707)

**Dependencies**

  - Instead of <span class="title-ref">chardet</span>, use the MIT-licensed <span class="title-ref">charset\_normalizer</span> for Python3 to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If <span class="title-ref">chardet</span> is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of <span class="title-ref">charset\_normalizer</span> to keep backwards compatibility. (\#5797)
    
    You can also install <span class="title-ref">chardet</span> while installing requests by specifying <span class="title-ref">\[use\_chardet\_on\_py3\]</span> extra as follows:
    
    > `` `shell pip install "requests[use_chardet_on_py3]" ``\`
    
    Python2 still depends upon the <span class="title-ref">chardet</span> module.

  - Requests now supports <span class="title-ref">idna</span> 3.x on Python 3. <span class="title-ref">idna</span> 2.x will continue to be used on Python 2 installations. (\#5711)

**Deprecations**

  - The <span class="title-ref">requests\[security\]</span> extra has been converted to a no-op install. PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (\#5867)
  - Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (\#5867)

## 2.25.1 (2020-12-16)

**Bugfixes**

  - Requests now treats <span class="title-ref">application/json</span> as <span class="title-ref">utf8</span> by default. Resolving inconsistencies between <span class="title-ref">r.text</span> and <span class="title-ref">r.json</span> output. (\#5673)

**Dependencies**

  - Requests now supports chardet v4.x.

## 2.25.0 (2020-11-11)

**Improvements**

  - Added support for NETRC environment variable. (\#5643)

  - The <span class="title-ref">requests\[security\]</span> extra is officially deprecated and will be removed in Requests v2.26.0.

## 2.24.0 (2020-06-17)

**Improvements**

  - pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python either doesn't have an <span class="title-ref">ssl</span> module or doesn't support SNI. Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available. This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the <span class="title-ref">requests\[security\]</span> extra (\#5443)
  - Redirect resolution should now only occur when <span class="title-ref">allow\_redirects</span> is True. (\#5492)
  - No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for requests that won't use it. (\#5496)

## 2.23.0 (2020-02-19)

**Improvements**

  - Remove defunct reference to <span class="title-ref">prefetch</span> in Session <span class="title-ref">\_\_attrs\_\_</span> (\#5110)

**Bugfixes**

  - Requests no longer outputs password in basic auth usage warning. (\#5099)

**Dependencies**

  - Pinning for <span class="title-ref">chardet</span> and <span class="title-ref">idna</span> now uses major version instead of minor. This hopefully reduces the need for releases every time a dependency is updated.

## 2.22.0 (2019-05-15)

**Dependencies**

  - Requests now supports urllib3 v1.25.2. (note: 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 are incompatible)

**Bugfixes**

  - Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g. charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).
  - Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise uncaught urllib3 exceptions.
  - Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)
  - <span class="title-ref">should\_bypass\_proxies</span> now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g. files).

**Dependencies**

  - Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.

**Deprecations**

  - Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.

## 2.19.1 (2018-06-14)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed issue where status\_codes.py's <span class="title-ref">init</span> function failed trying to append to a <span class="title-ref">\_\_doc\_\_</span> value of <span class="title-ref">None</span>.

## 2.19.0 (2018-06-12)

**Improvements**

  - Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version \&lt; 1.3.4
  - Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to adapter.

  - Added support for SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest auth algorithms.
  - Minor performance improvement to <span class="title-ref">Request.content</span>.
  - Migrate to using collections.abc for 3.7 compatibility.

**Bugfixes**

  - Parsing empty <span class="title-ref">Link</span> headers with <span class="title-ref">parse\_header\_links()</span> no longer return one bogus entry.
  - Fixed issue where loading the default certificate bundle from a zip archive would raise an <span class="title-ref">IOError</span>.
  - Fixed issue with unexpected <span class="title-ref">ImportError</span> on windows system which do not support <span class="title-ref">winreg</span> module.
  - DNS resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and password in the request. This also fixes the issue of DNS queries failing on macOS.

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed issue where Requests would raise <span class="title-ref">ConnectionError</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">SSLError</span> when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.

## 2.18.2 (2017-07-25)

**Bugfixes**

  - <span class="title-ref">requests.help</span> no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of <span class="title-ref">ssl.OPENSSL\_VERSION\_NUMBER</span>.

**Dependencies**

  - We now support urllib3 v1.22.

## 2.18.1 (2017-06-14)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fix an error in the packaging whereby the <span class="title-ref">\*.whl</span> contained incorrect data that regressed the fix in v2.17.3.

## 2.18.0 (2017-06-14)

**Improvements**

  - <span class="title-ref">Response</span> is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a <span class="title-ref">with</span> statement without first having to be wrapped by <span class="title-ref">contextlib.closing()</span>.

**Bugfixes**

  - Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
  - Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the number of CPU cores
  - Resolve error swallowing in utils set\_environ generator

## 2.17.3 (2017-05-29)

**Improvements**

  - Improved <span class="title-ref">packages</span> namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.

## 2.17.2 (2017-05-29)

**Improvements**

  - Improved <span class="title-ref">packages</span> namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.

## 2.17.1 (2017-05-29)

**Improvements**

  - Improved <span class="title-ref">packages</span> namespace identity support, for monkeypatching libraries.

## 2.17.0 (2017-05-29)

**Improvements**

  - Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.

## 2.16.5 (2017-05-28)

  - Improvements to <span class="title-ref">$ python -m requests.help</span>.

## 2.16.4 (2017-05-27)

  - Introduction of the <span class="title-ref">$ python -m requests.help</span> command, for debugging with maintainers\!

## 2.16.3 (2017-05-27)

  - Further restored the <span class="title-ref">requests.packages</span> namespace for compatibility reasons.

## 2.16.2 (2017-05-27)

  - Further restored the <span class="title-ref">requests.packages</span> namespace for compatibility reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be necessary any longer.

## 2.16.1 (2017-05-27)

  - Restored the <span class="title-ref">requests.packages</span> namespace for compatibility reasons.
  - Bugfix for <span class="title-ref">urllib3</span> version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the <span class="title-ref">requests.packages</span> namespace previously will have to import code that rests at this module-level now.

For example:

> from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be:

> from requests.packages import urllib3 urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better:

> from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

## 2.16.0 (2017-05-26)

  - Unvendor ALL the things\!

## 2.15.1 (2017-05-26)

  - Everyone makes mistakes.

## 2.15.0 (2017-05-26)

**Improvements**

  - Introduction of the <span class="title-ref">Response.next</span> property, for getting the next <span class="title-ref">PreparedResponse</span> from a redirect chain (when <span class="title-ref">allow\_redirects=False</span>).
  - Internal refactoring of <span class="title-ref">\_\_version\_\_</span> module.

**Bugfixes**

  - Restored once-optional parameter for <span class="title-ref">requests.utils.get\_environ\_proxies()</span>.

## 2.14.2 (2017-05-10)

**Bugfixes**

  - Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.

## 2.14.1 (2017-05-09)

**Bugfixes**

  - Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip releases.

## 2.14.0 (2017-05-09)

**Improvements**

  - It is now possible to pass <span class="title-ref">no\_proxy</span> as a key to the <span class="title-ref">proxies</span> dictionary to provide handling similar to the <span class="title-ref">NO\_PROXY</span> environment variable.
  - When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or directories Requests now raises <span class="title-ref">IOError</span>, rather than failing at the time of the HTTPS request with a fairly inscrutable certificate validation error.
  - The behavior of <span class="title-ref">SessionRedirectMixin</span> was slightly altered. <span class="title-ref">resolve\_redirects</span> will now detect a redirect by calling <span class="title-ref">get\_redirect\_target(response)</span> instead of directly querying <span class="title-ref">Response.is\_redirect</span> and <span class="title-ref">Response.headers\['location'\]</span>. Advanced users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
  - Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have higher resolution on Windows.
  - Added <span class="title-ref">win\_inet\_pton</span> as conditional dependency for the <span class="title-ref">\[socks\]</span> extra on Windows with Python 2.7.
  - Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
  - URLs with schemes that begin with <span class="title-ref">http</span> but are not <span class="title-ref">http</span> or <span class="title-ref">https</span> no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

  - Much improved handling of non-ASCII <span class="title-ref">Location</span> header values in redirects. Fewer <span class="title-ref">UnicodeDecodeErrors</span> are encountered on Python 2, and Python 3 now correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to be the correct encoding.
  - If an attempt to <span class="title-ref">seek</span> file to find out its length fails, we now appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length calculations.
  - Restricted <span class="title-ref">HTTPDigestAuth</span> to only respond to auth challenges made on 4XX responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
  - Fixed some code that was firing <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span> on Python 3.6.
  - The dismayed person emoticon (<span class="title-ref">/o</span>) no longer has a big head. I'm sure this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
  - Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
  - Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
  - Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

## 2.13.0 (2017-01-24)

**Features**

  - Only load the <span class="title-ref">idna</span> library when we've determined we need it. This will save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
  - Updated bundled idna to 2.2.

## 2.12.5 (2017-01-18)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.

## 2.12.4 (2016-12-14)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in the basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been re-added, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the future.

## 2.12.3 (2016-12-01)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with "http". These URLs have historically been processed as though they were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This change was reverted: the other fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.

## 2.12.2 (2016-11-30)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically invalid but which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to IDNA-encode a URL if it can but, if it fails, and the host contains only ASCII characters, it will be passed through optimistically. This will allow users to opt-in to using IDNA2003 themselves if they want to, and will also allow technically invalid but still common hostnames.
  - Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise <span class="title-ref">InvalidSchema</span> errors.
  - Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes would still have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
  - Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic auth.
  - Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where constructing a Response object would cause <span class="title-ref">Response.content</span> to raise an <span class="title-ref">AttributeError</span>.

## 2.12.1 (2016-11-16)

**Bugfixes**

  - Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.

## 2.12.0 (2016-11-15)

**Improvements**

  - Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to IDNA2008. This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs and is mandatory for .de domains.
  - Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will no longer read an entire <span class="title-ref">StringIO</span> into memory.
  - Much improved logic for recalculating <span class="title-ref">Content-Length</span> headers for <span class="title-ref">PreparedRequest</span> objects.
  - Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no <span class="title-ref">tell</span> method but do have a <span class="title-ref">seek</span> method.
  - Anything that is a subclass of <span class="title-ref">Mapping</span> is now treated like a dictionary by the <span class="title-ref">data=</span> keyword argument.
  - Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather than stripping the credentials.
  - If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

  - When calling <span class="title-ref">response.close</span>, the call to <span class="title-ref">close</span> will be propagated through to non-urllib3 backends.
  - Fixed issue where the <span class="title-ref">ALL\_PROXY</span> environment variable would be preferred over scheme-specific variables like <span class="title-ref">HTTP\_PROXY</span>.
  - Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by falling back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
  - Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set when using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the native string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
  - Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.

## 2.11.1 (2016-08-17)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed a bug when using <span class="title-ref">iter\_content</span> with <span class="title-ref">decode\_unicode=True</span> for streamed bodies would raise <span class="title-ref">AttributeError</span>. This bug was introduced in 2.11.
  - Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header block when following a redirect that transforms the verb from POST/PUT to GET.

## 2.11.0 (2016-08-08)

**Improvements**

  - Added support for the <span class="title-ref">ALL\_PROXY</span> environment variable.
  - Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

  - Fixed occasional <span class="title-ref">TypeError</span> when attempting to decode a JSON response that occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a <span class="title-ref">ValueError</span>.
  - Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the <span class="title-ref">NO\_PROXY</span> environment variables: Requests now treats it as a specific IP.
  - Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter obscure OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
  - Added type checks to ensure that <span class="title-ref">iter\_content</span> only accepts integers and <span class="title-ref">None</span> for chunk sizes.
  - Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the connection pool, which could cause Requests to hang in situations where the <span class="title-ref">HTTPAdapter</span> had been configured to use a blocking connection pool.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.
  - Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as acceptable header values. This release does not.

## 2.10.0 (2016-04-29)

**New Features**

  - SOCKS Proxy Support\! (requires PySocks; <span class="title-ref">$ pip install requests\[socks\]</span>)

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.

## 2.9.2 (2016-04-29)

**Improvements**

  - Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use OrderedDict as its underlying datastore.

**Bugfixes**

  - Don't use redirect\_cache if allow\_redirects=False
  - When passed objects that throw exceptions from <span class="title-ref">tell()</span>, send them via chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.
  - Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

## 2.9.1 (2015-12-21)

**Bugfixes**

  - Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to send binary strings as bodies in Python 3.
  - Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain locales.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

## 2.9.0 (2015-12-15)

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)

  - The <span class="title-ref">verify</span> keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
  - Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
  - Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the status code registry.

**Bugfixes**

  - For file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we now send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing partial file uploads.
  - When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no obvious content length we set <span class="title-ref">Transfer-Encoding: chunked</span> rather than <span class="title-ref">Content-Length: 0</span>.
  - We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading chunked bodies.
  - We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python 3, by decoding it as UTF-8.
  - Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the garbage collector to clean them up.
  - Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed <span class="title-ref">qop</span> directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no <span class="title-ref">qop</span> directive was provided at all.
  - Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by name.

**Miscellaneous**

  - Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

## 2.8.1 (2015-10-13)

**Bugfixes**

  - Update certificate bundle to match <span class="title-ref">certifi</span> 2015.9.6.2's weak certificate bundle.
  - Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise <span class="title-ref">ConnectTimeout</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">ConnectionError</span>
  - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly respect the <span class="title-ref">json</span> parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
  - When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly handle a Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

## 2.8.0 (2015-10-05)

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)

  - Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the <span class="title-ref">proxies</span> dictionary to have entries of the form <span class="title-ref">{'\<scheme\>://\<hostname\>': '\<proxy\>'}</span>. Host-specific proxies will be used in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific ones, but the previous syntax will continue to work.
  - <span class="title-ref">Response.raise\_for\_status</span> now prints the URL that failed as part of the exception message.
  - <span class="title-ref">requests.utils.get\_netrc\_auth</span> now takes an <span class="title-ref">raise\_errors</span> kwarg, defaulting to <span class="title-ref">False</span>. When <span class="title-ref">True</span>, errors parsing <span class="title-ref">.netrc</span> files cause exceptions to be thrown.
  - Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to unbundle requests downstream.
  - Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on Linux: now contains only the requests version.

**Bugfixes**

  - The <span class="title-ref">json</span> parameter to <span class="title-ref">post()</span> and friends will now only be used if neither <span class="title-ref">data</span> nor <span class="title-ref">files</span> are present, consistent with the documentation.
  - We now ignore empty fields in the <span class="title-ref">NO\_PROXY</span> environment variable.
  - Fixed problem where <span class="title-ref">httplib.BadStatusLine</span> would get raised if combining <span class="title-ref">stream=True</span> with <span class="title-ref">contextlib.closing</span>.
  - Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
  - Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
  - Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

**Updates**

  - Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

## 2.7.0 (2015-05-03)

This is the first release that follows our new release process. For more, see \[our documentation\](<https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/release-process/>).

**Bugfixes**

  - Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked transfer encoding and response framing.

## 2.6.2 (2015-04-23)

**Bugfixes**

  - Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data was not properly decompressed. (\#2561)

## 2.6.1 (2015-04-22)

**Bugfixes**

  - Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.
  - Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the user to pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f. \#2552)
  - Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original arguments to the adapter. (\#2503)
  - Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL that cannot be encoded in ASCII. (\#2540)
  - Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest Authentication. (\#2426)
  - Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an instance of RequestsCookieJar. (\#2527)

## 2.6.0 (2015-03-14)

**Bugfixes**

  - CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the redirected URL exposing requests users to session fixation attacks and potentially cookie stealing. This was disclosed privately by Matthew Daley of \[BugFuzz\](<https://bugfuzz.com>). This affects all versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).
  - Fix error when requests is an <span class="title-ref">install\_requires</span> dependency and <span class="title-ref">python setup.py test</span> is run. (\#2462)
  - Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use the vendored import location.
  - Include fixes to <span class="title-ref">urllib3</span>'s header handling.
  - Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more restrictive.

**Features and Improvements**

  - Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the <span class="title-ref">files</span> argument. (\#2468)
  - Avoid data duplication when creating a request with <span class="title-ref">str</span>, <span class="title-ref">bytes</span>, or <span class="title-ref">bytearray</span> input to the <span class="title-ref">files</span> argument.

## 2.5.3 (2015-02-24)

**Bugfixes**

  - Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context see (\#2455, \#2456, and \<<https://bugs.python.org/issue23476>\>)

## 2.5.2 (2015-02-23)

**Features and Improvements**

  - Add sha256 fingerprint support. (\[shazow/urllib3\#540\](<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/540>))
  - Improve the performance of headers. (\[shazow/urllib3\#544\](<https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544>))

**Bugfixes**

  - Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let those same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3 will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.
  - Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then quoting fails. (\#2356)
  - Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (\#2411)
  - Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest authentication challenges provides both auth and auth-int qop-values. (\#2408)

# Contributor's Guide

If you're reading this, you're probably interested in contributing to Requests. Thank you very much\! Open source projects live-and-die based on the support they receive from others, and the fact that you're even considering contributing to the Requests project is *very* generous of you.

This document lays out guidelines and advice for contributing to this project. If you're thinking of contributing, please start by reading this document and getting a feel for how contributing to this project works. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to either [Nate Prewitt](https://www.nateprewitt.com/), [Ian Cordasco](http://www.coglib.com/~icordasc/), or [Seth Michael Larson](https://sethmlarson.dev/), the primary maintainers.

The guide is split into sections based on the type of contribution you're thinking of making, with a section that covers general guidelines for all contributors.

## Be Cordial

> **Be cordial or be on your way**. *—Kenneth Reitz*

Requests has one very important rule governing all forms of contribution, including reporting bugs or requesting features. This golden rule is "[be cordial or be on your way](https://kenreitz.org/essays/2013/01/27/be-cordial-or-be-on-your-way)".

**All contributions are welcome**, as long as everyone involved is treated with respect.

## Get Early Feedback

If you are contributing, do not feel the need to sit on your contribution until it is perfectly polished and complete. It helps everyone involved for you to seek feedback as early as you possibly can. Submitting an early, unfinished version of your contribution for feedback in no way prejudices your chances of getting that contribution accepted, and can save you from putting a lot of work into a contribution that is not suitable for the project.

## Contribution Suitability

Our project maintainers have the last word on whether or not a contribution is suitable for Requests. All contributions will be considered carefully, but from time to time, contributions will be rejected because they do not suit the current goals or needs of the project.

If your contribution is rejected, don't despair\! As long as you followed these guidelines, you will have a much better chance of getting your next contribution accepted.

## Code Contributions

### Steps for Submitting Code

When contributing code, you'll want to follow this checklist:

1.  Fork the repository on GitHub.
2.  Run the tests to confirm they all pass on your system. If they don't, you'll need to investigate why they fail. If you're unable to diagnose this yourself, raise it as a bug report by following the guidelines in this document: \[bug-reports\](\#bug-reports).
3.  Write tests that demonstrate your bug or feature. Ensure that they fail.
4.  Make your change.
5.  Run the entire test suite again, confirming that all tests pass *including the ones you just added*.
6.  Send a GitHub Pull Request to the main repository's `main` branch. GitHub Pull Requests are the expected method of code collaboration on this project.

The following sub-sections go into more detail on some of the points above.

### Code Review

Contributions will not be merged until they've been code reviewed. You should implement any code review feedback unless you strongly object to it. In the event that you object to the code review feedback, you should make your case clearly and calmly. If, after doing so, the feedback is judged to still apply, you must either apply the feedback or withdraw your contribution.

### Code Style

Requests uses a collection of tools to ensure the code base has a consistent style as it grows. We have these orchestrated using a tool called [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/). This can be installed locally and run over your changes prior to opening a PR, and will also be run as part of the CI approval process before a change is merged.

You can find the full list of formatting requirements specified in the [.pre-commit-config.yaml](https://github.com/psf/requests/blob/main/.pre-commit-config.yaml) at the top level directory of Requests.

### New Contributors

If you are new or relatively new to Open Source, welcome\! Requests aims to be a gentle introduction to the world of Open Source. If you're concerned about how best to contribute, please consider mailing a maintainer (listed above) and asking for help.

Please also check the \[early-feedback\](\#early-feedback) section.

## Documentation Contributions

Documentation improvements are always welcome\! The documentation files live in the `docs/` directory of the codebase. They're written in [reStructuredText](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html), and use [Sphinx](http://sphinx-doc.org/index.html) to generate the full suite of documentation.

When contributing documentation, please do your best to follow the style of the documentation files. This means a soft-limit of 79 characters wide in your text files and a semi-formal, yet friendly and approachable, prose style.

When presenting Python code, use single-quoted strings (`'hello'` instead of `"hello"`).

## Bug Reports

Bug reports are hugely important\! Before you raise one, though, please check through the [GitHub issues](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues), **both open and closed**, to confirm that the bug hasn't been reported before. Duplicate bug reports are a huge drain on the time of other contributors, and should be avoided as much as possible.

## Feature Requests

Requests is in a perpetual feature freeze, only the BDFL can add or approve of new features. The maintainers believe that Requests is a feature-complete piece of software at this time.

One of the most important skills to have while maintaining a largely-used open source project is learning the ability to say "no" to suggested changes, while keeping an open ear and mind.

If you believe there is a feature missing, feel free to raise a feature request, but please do be aware that the overwhelming likelihood is that your feature request will not be accepted.

# Requests: HTTP for Humans™

Release v. (\[Installation \<install\>\](\#installation-\<install\>))

[![Requests Downloads Per Month Badge](https://static.pepy.tech/badge/requests/month)](https://pepy.tech/project/requests)

[![License Badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/l/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

[![Wheel Support Badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/wheel/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

[![Python Version Support Badge](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/requests.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/requests/)

**Requests** is an elegant and simple HTTP library for Python, built for human beings.

-----

**Behold, the power of Requests**:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/user', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    >>> r.headers['content-type']
    'application/json; charset=utf8'
    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.text
    '{"type":"User"...'
    >>> r.json()
    {'private_gists': 419, 'total_private_repos': 77, ...}

See [similar code, sans Requests](https://gist.github.com/973705).

**Requests** allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There's no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your POST data. Keep-alive and HTTP connection pooling are 100% automatic, thanks to [urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3).

## Beloved Features

Requests is ready for today's web.

  - Keep-Alive & Connection Pooling
  - International Domains and URLs
  - Sessions with Cookie Persistence
  - Browser-style SSL Verification
  - Automatic Content Decoding
  - Basic/Digest Authentication
  - Elegant Key/Value Cookies
  - Automatic Decompression
  - Unicode Response Bodies
  - HTTP(S) Proxy Support
  - Multipart File Uploads
  - Streaming Downloads
  - Connection Timeouts
  - Chunked Requests
  - `.netrc` Support

Requests officially supports Python 3.8+, and runs great on PyPy.

## The User Guide

This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, begins with some background information about Requests, then focuses on step-by-step instructions for getting the most out of Requests.

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

user/install user/quickstart user/advanced user/authentication

</div>

## The Community Guide

This part of the documentation, which is mostly prose, details the Requests ecosystem and community.

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="2">

community/recommended community/faq community/out-there community/support community/vulnerabilities community/release-process

</div>

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="1">

# Advanced Usage

This document covers some of Requests more advanced features.

## Session Objects

The Session object allows you to persist certain parameters across requests. It also persists cookies across all requests made from the Session instance, and will use `urllib3`'s [connection pooling](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/urllib3.connectionpool.html). So if you're making several requests to the same host, the underlying TCP connection will be reused, which can result in a significant performance increase (see [HTTP persistent connection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_persistent_connection)).

A Session object has all the methods of the main Requests API.

Let's persist some cookies across requests:

    s = requests.Session()
    
    s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')
    r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies')
    
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {"sessioncookie": "123456789"}}'

Sessions can also be used to provide default data to the request methods. This is done by providing data to the properties on a Session object:

    s = requests.Session()
    s.auth = ('user', 'pass')
    s.headers.update({'x-test': 'true'})
    
    # both 'x-test' and 'x-test2' are sent
    s.get('https://httpbin.org/headers', headers={'x-test2': 'true'})

Any dictionaries that you pass to a request method will be merged with the session-level values that are set. The method-level parameters override session parameters.

Note, however, that method-level parameters will *not* be persisted across requests, even if using a session. This example will only send the cookies with the first request, but not the second:

    s = requests.Session()
    
    r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies', cookies={'from-my': 'browser'})
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {"from-my": "browser"}}'
    
    r = s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies')
    print(r.text)
    # '{"cookies": {}}'

If you want to manually add cookies to your session, use the \[Cookie utility functions \<api-cookies\>\](\#cookie-utility-functions-\<api-cookies\>) to manipulate <span class="title-ref">Session.cookies \<requests.Session.cookies\></span>.

Sessions can also be used as context managers:

    with requests.Session() as s:
        s.get('https://httpbin.org/cookies/set/sessioncookie/123456789')

This will make sure the session is closed as soon as the `with` block is exited, even if unhandled exceptions occurred.

<div class="admonition">

Remove a Value From a Dict Parameter

Sometimes you'll want to omit session-level keys from a dict parameter. To do this, you simply set that key's value to `None` in the method-level parameter. It will automatically be omitted.

</div>

All values that are contained within a session are directly available to you. See the \[Session API Docs \<sessionapi\>\](\#session-api-docs-\<sessionapi\>) to learn more.

## Request and Response Objects

Whenever a call is made to `requests.get()` and friends, you are doing two major things. First, you are constructing a `Request` object which will be sent off to a server to request or query some resource. Second, a `Response` object is generated once Requests gets a response back from the server. The `Response` object contains all of the information returned by the server and also contains the `Request` object you created originally. Here is a simple request to get some very important information from Wikipedia's servers:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monty_Python')

If we want to access the headers the server sent back to us, we do this:

    >>> r.headers
    {'content-length': '56170', 'x-content-type-options': 'nosniff', 'x-cache':
    'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet, MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet', 'content-encoding':
    'gzip', 'age': '3080', 'content-language': 'en', 'vary': 'Accept-Encoding,Cookie',
    'server': 'Apache', 'last-modified': 'Wed, 13 Jun 2012 01:33:50 GMT',
    'connection': 'close', 'cache-control': 'private, s-maxage=0, max-age=0,
    must-revalidate', 'date': 'Thu, 14 Jun 2012 12:59:39 GMT', 'content-type':
    'text/html; charset=UTF-8', 'x-cache-lookup': 'HIT from cp1006.eqiad.wmnet:3128,
    MISS from cp1010.eqiad.wmnet:80'}

However, if we want to get the headers we sent the server, we simply access the request, and then the request's headers:

    >>> r.request.headers
    {'Accept-Encoding': 'identity, deflate, compress, gzip',
    'Accept': '*/*', 'User-Agent': 'python-requests/1.2.0'}

## Prepared Requests

Whenever you receive a <span class="title-ref">Response \<requests.Response\></span> object from an API call or a Session call, the `request` attribute is actually the `PreparedRequest` that was used. In some cases you may wish to do some extra work to the body or headers (or anything else really) before sending a request. The simple recipe for this is the following:

    from requests import Request, Session
    
    s = Session()
    
    req = Request('POST', url, data=data, headers=headers)
    prepped = req.prepare()
    
    # do something with prepped.body
    prepped.body = 'No, I want exactly this as the body.'
    
    # do something with prepped.headers
    del prepped.headers['Content-Type']
    
    resp = s.send(prepped,
        stream=stream,
        verify=verify,
        proxies=proxies,
        cert=cert,
        timeout=timeout
    )
    
    print(resp.status_code)

Since you are not doing anything special with the `Request` object, you prepare it immediately and modify the `PreparedRequest` object. You then send that with the other parameters you would have sent to `requests.*` or `Session.*`.

However, the above code will lose some of the advantages of having a Requests <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span> object. In particular, <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span>-level state such as cookies will not get applied to your request. To get a <span class="title-ref">PreparedRequest \<requests.PreparedRequest\></span> with that state applied, replace the call to <span class="title-ref">Request.prepare() \<requests.Request.prepare\></span> with a call to <span class="title-ref">Session.prepare\_request() \<requests.Session.prepare\_request\></span>, like this:

    from requests import Request, Session
    
    s = Session()
    req = Request('GET',  url, data=data, headers=headers)
    
    prepped = s.prepare_request(req)
    
    # do something with prepped.body
    prepped.body = 'Seriously, send exactly these bytes.'
    
    # do something with prepped.headers
    prepped.headers['Keep-Dead'] = 'parrot'
    
    resp = s.send(prepped,
        stream=stream,
        verify=verify,
        proxies=proxies,
        cert=cert,
        timeout=timeout
    )
    
    print(resp.status_code)

When you are using the prepared request flow, keep in mind that it does not take into account the environment. This can cause problems if you are using environment variables to change the behaviour of requests. For example: Self-signed SSL certificates specified in `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` will not be taken into account. As a result an `SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED` is thrown. You can get around this behaviour by explicitly merging the environment settings into your session:

    from requests import Request, Session
    
    s = Session()
    req = Request('GET', url)
    
    prepped = s.prepare_request(req)
    
    # Merge environment settings into session
    settings = s.merge_environment_settings(prepped.url, {}, None, None, None)
    resp = s.send(prepped, **settings)
    
    print(resp.status_code)

## SSL Cert Verification

Requests verifies SSL certificates for HTTPS requests, just like a web browser. By default, SSL verification is enabled, and Requests will throw a SSLError if it's unable to verify the certificate:

    >>> requests.get('https://requestb.in')
    requests.exceptions.SSLError: hostname 'requestb.in' doesn't match either of '*.herokuapp.com', 'herokuapp.com'

I don't have SSL setup on this domain, so it throws an exception. Excellent. GitHub does though:

    >>> requests.get('https://github.com')
    <Response [200]>

You can pass `verify` the path to a CA\_BUNDLE file or directory with certificates of trusted CAs:

    >>> requests.get('https://github.com', verify='/path/to/certfile')

or persistent:

    s = requests.Session()
    s.verify = '/path/to/certfile'

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

If `verify` is set to a path to a directory, the directory must have been processed using the `c_rehash` utility supplied with OpenSSL.

</div>

This list of trusted CAs can also be specified through the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` environment variable. If `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` is not set, `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` will be used as fallback.

Requests can also ignore verifying the SSL certificate if you set `verify` to False:

    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', verify=False)
    <Response [200]>

Note that when `verify` is set to `False`, requests will accept any TLS certificate presented by the server, and will ignore hostname mismatches and/or expired certificates, which will make your application vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. Setting verify to `False` may be useful during local development or testing.

By default, `verify` is set to True. Option `verify` only applies to host certs.

## Client Side Certificates

You can also specify a local cert to use as client side certificate, as a single file (containing the private key and the certificate) or as a tuple of both files' paths:

    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', cert=('/path/client.cert', '/path/client.key'))
    <Response [200]>

or persistent:

    s = requests.Session()
    s.cert = '/path/client.cert'

If you specify a wrong path or an invalid cert, you'll get a SSLError:

    >>> requests.get('https://kennethreitz.org', cert='/wrong_path/client.pem')
    SSLError: [Errno 336265225] _ssl.c:347: error:140B0009:SSL routines:SSL_CTX_use_PrivateKey_file:PEM lib

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

The private key to your local certificate *must* be unencrypted. Currently, Requests does not support using encrypted keys.

</div>

## CA Certificates

Requests uses certificates from the package [certifi](https://certifiio.readthedocs.io/). This allows for users to update their trusted certificates without changing the version of Requests.

Before version 2.16, Requests bundled a set of root CAs that it trusted, sourced from the [Mozilla trust store](https://hg.mozilla.org/mozilla-central/raw-file/tip/security/nss/lib/ckfw/builtins/certdata.txt). The certificates were only updated once for each Requests version. When `certifi` was not installed, this led to extremely out-of-date certificate bundles when using significantly older versions of Requests.

For the sake of security we recommend upgrading certifi frequently\!

## Body Content Workflow

By default, when you make a request, the body of the response is downloaded immediately. You can override this behaviour and defer downloading the response body until you access the <span class="title-ref">Response.content \<requests.Response.content\></span> attribute with the `stream` parameter:

    tarball_url = 'https://github.com/psf/requests/tarball/main'
    r = requests.get(tarball_url, stream=True)

At this point only the response headers have been downloaded and the connection remains open, hence allowing us to make content retrieval conditional:

    if int(r.headers['content-length']) < TOO_LONG:
      content = r.content
      ...

You can further control the workflow by use of the <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_content() \<requests.Response.iter\_content\></span> and <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_lines() \<requests.Response.iter\_lines\></span> methods. Alternatively, you can read the undecoded body from the underlying urllib3 <span class="title-ref">urllib3.HTTPResponse \<urllib3.response.HTTPResponse\></span> at <span class="title-ref">Response.raw \<requests.Response.raw\></span>.

If you set `stream` to `True` when making a request, Requests cannot release the connection back to the pool unless you consume all the data or call <span class="title-ref">Response.close \<requests.Response.close\></span>. This can lead to inefficiency with connections. If you find yourself partially reading request bodies (or not reading them at all) while using `stream=True`, you should make the request within a `with` statement to ensure it's always closed:

    with requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', stream=True) as r:
        # Do things with the response here.

## Keep-Alive

Excellent news — thanks to urllib3, keep-alive is 100% automatic within a session\! Any requests that you make within a session will automatically reuse the appropriate connection\!

Note that connections are only released back to the pool for reuse once all body data has been read; be sure to either set `stream` to `False` or read the `content` property of the `Response` object.

## Streaming Uploads

Requests supports streaming uploads, which allow you to send large streams or files without reading them into memory. To stream and upload, simply provide a file-like object for your body:

    with open('massive-body', 'rb') as f:
        requests.post('http://some.url/streamed', data=f)

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

It is strongly recommended that you open files in \[binary mode \<tut-files\>\](\#binary

</div>

  - \-------------mode-\<tut-files\>). This is because Requests may attempt to provide  
    the `Content-Length` header for you, and if it does this value will be set to the number of *bytes* in the file. Errors may occur if you open the file in *text mode*.

## Chunk-Encoded Requests

Requests also supports Chunked transfer encoding for outgoing and incoming requests. To send a chunk-encoded request, simply provide a generator (or any iterator without a length) for your body:

    def gen():
        yield 'hi'
        yield 'there'
    
    requests.post('http://some.url/chunked', data=gen())

For chunked encoded responses, it's best to iterate over the data using <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_content() \<requests.Response.iter\_content\></span>. In an ideal situation you'll have set `stream=True` on the request, in which case you can iterate chunk-by-chunk by calling `iter_content` with a `chunk_size` parameter of `None`. If you want to set a maximum size of the chunk, you can set a `chunk_size` parameter to any integer.

## POST Multiple Multipart-Encoded Files

You can send multiple files in one request. For example, suppose you want to upload image files to an HTML form with a multiple file field 'images':

    <input type="file" name="images" multiple="true" required="true"/>

To do that, just set files to a list of tuples of `(form_field_name, file_info)`:

    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
    >>> multiple_files = [
    ...     ('images', ('foo.png', open('foo.png', 'rb'), 'image/png')),
    ...     ('images', ('bar.png', open('bar.png', 'rb'), 'image/png'))]
    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=multiple_files)
    >>> r.text
    {
      ...
      'files': {'images': 'data:image/png;base64,iVBORw ....'}
      'Content-Type': 'multipart/form-data; boundary=3131623adb2043caaeb5538cc7aa0b3a',
      ...
    }

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

It is strongly recommended that you open files in \[binary mode \<tut-files\>\](\#binary

</div>

  - \-------------mode-\<tut-files\>). This is because Requests may attempt to provide  
    the `Content-Length` header for you, and if it does this value will be set to the number of *bytes* in the file. Errors may occur if you open the file in *text mode*.

## Event Hooks

Requests has a hook system that you can use to manipulate portions of the request process, or signal event handling.

Available hooks:

  - `response`:  
    The response generated from a Request.

You can assign a hook function on a per-request basis by passing a `{hook_name: callback_function}` dictionary to the `hooks` request parameter:

    hooks={'response': print_url}

That `callback_function` will receive a chunk of data as its first argument.

    def print_url(r, *args, **kwargs):
        print(r.url)

Your callback function must handle its own exceptions. Any unhandled exception won't be passed silently and thus should be handled by the code calling Requests.

If the callback function returns a value, it is assumed that it is to replace the data that was passed in. If the function doesn't return anything, nothing else is affected.

    def record_hook(r, *args, **kwargs):
        r.hook_called = True
        return r

Let's print some request method arguments at runtime:

    >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/', hooks={'response': print_url})
    https://httpbin.org/
    <Response [200]>

You can add multiple hooks to a single request. Let's call two hooks at once:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/', hooks={'response': [print_url, record_hook]})
    >>> r.hook_called
    True

You can also add hooks to a `Session` instance. Any hooks you add will then be called on every request made to the session. For example:

    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> s.hooks['response'].append(print_url)
    >>> s.get('https://httpbin.org/')
     https://httpbin.org/
     <Response [200]>

A `Session` can have multiple hooks, which will be called in the order they are added.

## Custom Authentication

Requests allows you to specify your own authentication mechanism.

Any callable which is passed as the `auth` argument to a request method will have the opportunity to modify the request before it is dispatched.

Authentication implementations are subclasses of <span class="title-ref">AuthBase \<requests.auth.AuthBase\></span>, and are easy to define. Requests provides two common authentication scheme implementations in `requests.auth`: <span class="title-ref">HTTPBasicAuth \<requests.auth.HTTPBasicAuth\></span> and <span class="title-ref">HTTPDigestAuth \<requests.auth.HTTPDigestAuth\></span>.

Let's pretend that we have a web service that will only respond if the `X-Pizza` header is set to a password value. Unlikely, but just go with it.

    from requests.auth import AuthBase
    
    class PizzaAuth(AuthBase):
        """Attaches HTTP Pizza Authentication to the given Request object."""
        def __init__(self, username):
            # setup any auth-related data here
            self.username = username
    
        def __call__(self, r):
            # modify and return the request
            r.headers['X-Pizza'] = self.username
            return r

Then, we can make a request using our Pizza Auth:

    >>> requests.get('http://pizzabin.org/admin', auth=PizzaAuth('kenneth'))
    <Response [200]>

## Streaming Requests

With <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_lines() \<requests.Response.iter\_lines\></span> you can easily iterate over streaming APIs such as the [Twitter Streaming API](https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview). Simply set `stream` to `True` and iterate over the response with \`\~requests.Response.iter\_lines()\`:

    import json
    import requests
    
    r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/stream/20', stream=True)
    
    for line in r.iter_lines():
    
        # filter out keep-alive new lines
        if line:
            decoded_line = line.decode('utf-8')
            print(json.loads(decoded_line))

When using <span class="title-ref">decode\_unicode=True</span> with <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_lines() \<requests.Response.iter\_lines\></span> or <span class="title-ref">Response.iter\_content() \<requests.Response.iter\_content\></span>, you'll want to provide a fallback encoding in the event the server doesn't provide one:

    r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/stream/20', stream=True)
    
    if r.encoding is None:
        r.encoding = 'utf-8'
    
    for line in r.iter_lines(decode_unicode=True):
        if line:
            print(json.loads(line))

\> **Warning** \> <span class="title-ref">\~requests.Response.iter\_lines()</span> is not reentrant safe. Calling this method multiple times causes some of the received data being lost. In case you need to call it from multiple places, use the resulting iterator object instead:

    lines = r.iter_lines()
    # Save the first line for later or just skip it
    
    first_line = next(lines)
    
    for line in lines:
        print(line)

## Proxies

If you need to use a proxy, you can configure individual requests with the `proxies` argument to any request method:

    import requests
    
    proxies = {
      'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
      'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
    }
    
    requests.get('http://example.org', proxies=proxies)

Alternatively you can configure it once for an entire \`Session \<requests.Session\>\`:

    import requests
    
    proxies = {
      'http': 'http://10.10.1.10:3128',
      'https': 'http://10.10.1.10:1080',
    }
    session = requests.Session()
    session.proxies.update(proxies)
    
    session.get('http://example.org')

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

Setting `session.proxies` may behave differently than expected. Values provided will be overwritten by environmental proxies (those returned by [urllib.request.getproxies](https://docs.python.org/3/library/urllib.request.html#urllib.request.getproxies)). To ensure the use of proxies in the presence of environmental proxies, explicitly specify the `proxies` argument on all individual requests as initially explained above.

See [\#2018](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2018) for details.

</div>

When the proxies configuration is not overridden per request as shown above, Requests relies on the proxy configuration defined by standard environment variables `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, `no_proxy`, and `all_proxy`. Uppercase variants of these variables are also supported. You can therefore set them to configure Requests (only set the ones relevant to your needs):

    $ export HTTP_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:3128"
    $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
    $ export ALL_PROXY="socks5://10.10.1.10:3434"
    
    $ python
    >>> import requests
    >>> requests.get('http://example.org')

To use HTTP Basic Auth with your proxy, use the <span class="title-ref">http://user:password@host/</span> syntax in any of the above configuration entries:

    $ export HTTPS_PROXY="http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:1080"
    
    $ python
    >>> proxies = {'http': 'http://user:pass@10.10.1.10:3128/'}

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

Storing sensitive username and password information in an environment variable or a version-controlled file is a security risk and is highly discouraged.

</div>

To give a proxy for a specific scheme and host, use the <span class="title-ref">scheme://hostname</span> form for the key. This will match for any request to the given scheme and exact hostname.

    proxies = {'http://10.20.1.128': 'http://10.10.1.10:5323'}

Note that proxy URLs must include the scheme.

Finally, note that using a proxy for https connections typically requires your local machine to trust the proxy's root certificate. By default the list of certificates trusted by Requests can be found with:

    from requests.utils import DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH
    print(DEFAULT_CA_BUNDLE_PATH)

You override this default certificate bundle by setting the `REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE` (or `CURL_CA_BUNDLE`) environment variable to another file path:

    $ export REQUESTS_CA_BUNDLE="/usr/local/myproxy_info/cacert.pem"
    $ export https_proxy="http://10.10.1.10:1080"
    
    $ python
    >>> import requests
    >>> requests.get('https://example.org')

### SOCKS

<div class="versionadded">

2.10.0

</div>

In addition to basic HTTP proxies, Requests also supports proxies using the SOCKS protocol. This is an optional feature that requires that additional third-party libraries be installed before use.

You can get the dependencies for this feature from `pip`:

`` `bash     $ python -m pip install requests[socks]  Once you've installed those dependencies, using a SOCKS proxy is just as easy ``\` as using a HTTP one:

    proxies = {
        'http': 'socks5://user:pass@host:port',
        'https': 'socks5://user:pass@host:port'
    }

Using the scheme `socks5` causes the DNS resolution to happen on the client, rather than on the proxy server. This is in line with curl, which uses the scheme to decide whether to do the DNS resolution on the client or proxy. If you want to resolve the domains on the proxy server, use `socks5h` as the scheme.

## Compliance

Requests is intended to be compliant with all relevant specifications and RFCs where that compliance will not cause difficulties for users. This attention to the specification can lead to some behaviour that may seem unusual to those not familiar with the relevant specification.

### Encodings

When you receive a response, Requests makes a guess at the encoding to use for decoding the response when you access the <span class="title-ref">Response.text \<requests.Response.text\></span> attribute. Requests will first check for an encoding in the HTTP header, and if none is present, will use [charset\_normalizer](https://pypi.org/project/charset_normalizer/) or [chardet](https://github.com/chardet/chardet) to attempt to guess the encoding.

If `chardet` is installed, `requests` uses it, however for python3 `chardet` is no longer a mandatory dependency. The `chardet` library is an LGPL-licenced dependency and some users of requests cannot depend on mandatory LGPL-licensed dependencies.

When you install `requests` without specifying `[use_chardet_on_py3]` extra, and `chardet` is not already installed, `requests` uses `charset-normalizer` (MIT-licensed) to guess the encoding.

The only time Requests will not guess the encoding is if no explicit charset is present in the HTTP headers **and** the `Content-Type` header contains `text`. In this situation, [RFC 2616](https://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec3.html#sec3.7.1) specifies that the default charset must be `ISO-8859-1`. Requests follows the specification in this case. If you require a different encoding, you can manually set the <span class="title-ref">Response.encoding \<requests.Response.encoding\></span> property, or use the raw <span class="title-ref">Response.content \<requests.Response.content\></span>.

## HTTP Verbs

Requests provides access to almost the full range of HTTP verbs: GET, OPTIONS, HEAD, POST, PUT, PATCH and DELETE. The following provides detailed examples of using these various verbs in Requests, using the GitHub API.

We will begin with the verb most commonly used: GET. HTTP GET is an idempotent method that returns a resource from a given URL. As a result, it is the verb you ought to use when attempting to retrieve data from a web location. An example usage would be attempting to get information about a specific commit from GitHub. Suppose we wanted commit `a050faf` on Requests. We would get it like so:

    >>> import requests
    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/git/commits/a050faf084662f3a352dd1a941f2c7c9f886d4ad')

We should confirm that GitHub responded correctly. If it has, we want to work out what type of content it is. Do this like so:

    >>> if r.status_code == requests.codes.ok:
    ...     print(r.headers['content-type'])
    ...
    application/json; charset=utf-8

So, GitHub returns JSON. That's great, we can use the <span class="title-ref">r.json \<requests.Response.json\></span> method to parse it into Python objects.

    >>> commit_data = r.json()
    
    >>> print(commit_data.keys())
    ['committer', 'author', 'url', 'tree', 'sha', 'parents', 'message']
    
    >>> print(commit_data['committer'])
    {'date': '2012-05-10T11:10:50-07:00', 'email': 'me@kennethreitz.com', 'name': 'Kenneth Reitz'}
    
    >>> print(commit_data['message'])
    makin' history

So far, so simple. Well, let's investigate the GitHub API a little bit. Now, we could look at the documentation, but we might have a little more fun if we use Requests instead. We can take advantage of the Requests OPTIONS verb to see what kinds of HTTP methods are supported on the url we just used.

    >>> verbs = requests.options(r.url)
    >>> verbs.status_code
    500

Uh, what? That's unhelpful\! Turns out GitHub, like many API providers, don't actually implement the OPTIONS method. This is an annoying oversight, but it's OK, we can just use the boring documentation. If GitHub had correctly implemented OPTIONS, however, they should return the allowed methods in the headers, e.g.

    >>> verbs = requests.options('http://a-good-website.com/api/cats')
    >>> print(verbs.headers['allow'])
    GET,HEAD,POST,OPTIONS

Turning to the documentation, we see that the only other method allowed for commits is POST, which creates a new commit. As we're using the Requests repo, we should probably avoid making ham-handed POSTS to it. Instead, let's play with the Issues feature of GitHub.

This documentation was added in response to [Issue \#482](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/482). Given that this issue already exists, we will use it as an example. Let's start by getting it.

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/482')
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    
    >>> issue = json.loads(r.text)
    
    >>> print(issue['title'])
    Feature any http verb in docs
    
    >>> print(issue['comments'])
    3

Cool, we have three comments. Let's take a look at the last of them.

    >>> r = requests.get(r.url + '/comments')
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    
    >>> comments = r.json()
    
    >>> print(comments[0].keys())
    ['body', 'url', 'created_at', 'updated_at', 'user', 'id']
    
    >>> print(comments[2]['body'])
    Probably in the "advanced" section

Well, that seems like a silly place. Let's post a comment telling the poster that he's silly. Who is the poster, anyway?

    >>> print(comments[2]['user']['login'])
    kennethreitz

OK, so let's tell this Kenneth guy that we think this example should go in the quickstart guide instead. According to the GitHub API doc, the way to do this is to POST to the thread. Let's do it.

    >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it!"})
    >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/482/comments"
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body)
    >>> r.status_code
    404

Huh, that's weird. We probably need to authenticate. That'll be a pain, right? Wrong. Requests makes it easy to use many forms of authentication, including the very common Basic Auth.

    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    >>> auth = HTTPBasicAuth('fake@example.com', 'not_a_real_password')
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
    >>> r.status_code
    201
    
    >>> content = r.json()
    >>> print(content['body'])
    Sounds great! I'll get right on it.

Brilliant. Oh, wait, no\! I meant to add that it would take me a while, because I had to go feed my cat. If only I could edit this comment\! Happily, GitHub allows us to use another HTTP verb, PATCH, to edit this comment. Let's do that.

    >>> print(content[u"id"])
    5804413
    
    >>> body = json.dumps({u"body": u"Sounds great! I'll get right on it once I feed my cat."})
    >>> url = u"https://api.github.com/repos/psf/requests/issues/comments/5804413"
    
    >>> r = requests.patch(url=url, data=body, auth=auth)
    >>> r.status_code
    200

Excellent. Now, just to torture this Kenneth guy, I've decided to let him sweat and not tell him that I'm working on this. That means I want to delete this comment. GitHub lets us delete comments using the incredibly aptly named DELETE method. Let's get rid of it.

    >>> r = requests.delete(url=url, auth=auth)
    >>> r.status_code
    204
    >>> r.headers['status']
    '204 No Content'

Excellent. All gone. The last thing I want to know is how much of my ratelimit I've used. Let's find out. GitHub sends that information in the headers, so rather than download the whole page I'll send a HEAD request to get the headers.

    >>> r = requests.head(url=url, auth=auth)
    >>> print(r.headers)
    ...
    'x-ratelimit-remaining': '4995'
    'x-ratelimit-limit': '5000'
    ...

Excellent. Time to write a Python program that abuses the GitHub API in all kinds of exciting ways, 4995 more times.

## Custom Verbs

From time to time you may be working with a server that, for whatever reason, allows use or even requires use of HTTP verbs not covered above. One example of this would be the MKCOL method some WEBDAV servers use. Do not fret, these can still be used with Requests. These make use of the built-in `.request` method. For example:

    >>> r = requests.request('MKCOL', url, data=data)
    >>> r.status_code
    200 # Assuming your call was correct

Utilising this, you can make use of any method verb that your server allows.

## Link Headers

Many HTTP APIs feature Link headers. They make APIs more self describing and discoverable.

GitHub uses these for [pagination](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api) in their API, for example:

    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=1&per_page=10'
    >>> r = requests.head(url=url)
    >>> r.headers['link']
    '<https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10>; rel="next", <https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=6&per_page=10>; rel="last"'

Requests will automatically parse these link headers and make them easily consumable:

    >>> r.links["next"]
    {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=2&per_page=10', 'rel': 'next'}
    
    >>> r.links["last"]
    {'url': 'https://api.github.com/users/kennethreitz/repos?page=7&per_page=10', 'rel': 'last'}

## Transport Adapters

As of v1.0.0, Requests has moved to a modular internal design. Part of the reason this was done was to implement Transport Adapters, originally [described here](https://kenreitz.org/essays/2012/06/14/the-future-of-python-http). Transport Adapters provide a mechanism to define interaction methods for an HTTP service. In particular, they allow you to apply per-service configuration.

Requests ships with a single Transport Adapter, the <span class="title-ref">HTTPAdapter \<requests.adapters.HTTPAdapter\></span>. This adapter provides the default Requests interaction with HTTP and HTTPS using the powerful [urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3) library. Whenever a Requests <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span> is initialized, one of these is attached to the <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span> object for HTTP, and one for HTTPS.

Requests enables users to create and use their own Transport Adapters that provide specific functionality. Once created, a Transport Adapter can be mounted to a Session object, along with an indication of which web services it should apply to.

    >>> s = requests.Session()
    >>> s.mount('https://github.com/', MyAdapter())

The mount call registers a specific instance of a Transport Adapter to a prefix. Once mounted, any HTTP request made using that session whose URL starts with the given prefix will use the given Transport Adapter.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The adapter will be chosen based on a longest prefix match. Be mindful prefixes such as `http://localhost` will also match `http://localhost.other.com` or `http://localhost@other.com`. It's recommended to terminate full hostnames with a `/`.

</div>

Many of the details of implementing a Transport Adapter are beyond the scope of this documentation, but take a look at the next example for a simple SSL use-case. For more than that, you might look at subclassing the <span class="title-ref">BaseAdapter \<requests.adapters.BaseAdapter\></span>.

### Example: Specific SSL Version

The Requests team has made a specific choice to use whatever SSL version is default in the underlying library ([urllib3](https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3)). Normally this is fine, but from time to time, you might find yourself needing to connect to a service-endpoint that uses a version that isn't compatible with the default.

You can use Transport Adapters for this by taking most of the existing implementation of HTTPAdapter, and adding a parameter *ssl\_version* that gets passed-through to <span class="title-ref">urllib3</span>. We'll make a Transport Adapter that instructs the library to use SSLv3:

    import ssl
    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager
    
    from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter

    class Ssl3HttpAdapter(HTTPAdapter):
        """"Transport adapter" that allows us to use SSLv3."""
    
        def init_poolmanager(self, connections, maxsize, block=False):
            self.poolmanager = PoolManager(
                num_pools=connections, maxsize=maxsize,
                block=block, ssl_version=ssl.PROTOCOL_SSLv3)

### Example: Automatic Retries

By default, Requests does not retry failed connections. However, it is possible to implement automatic retries with a powerful array of features, including backoff, within a Requests <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span> using the [urllib3.util.Retry](https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/reference/urllib3.util.html#urllib3.util.Retry) class:

    from urllib3.util import Retry
    from requests import Session
    from requests.adapters import HTTPAdapter
    
    s = Session()
    retries = Retry(
        total=3,
        backoff_factor=0.1,
        status_forcelist=[502, 503, 504],
        allowed_methods={'POST'},
    )
    s.mount('https://', HTTPAdapter(max_retries=retries))

## Blocking Or Non-Blocking?

With the default Transport Adapter in place, Requests does not provide any kind of non-blocking IO. The <span class="title-ref">Response.content \<requests.Response.content\></span> property will block until the entire response has been downloaded. If you require more granularity, the streaming features of the library (see \[streaming-requests\](\#streaming-requests)) allow you to retrieve smaller quantities of the response at a time. However, these calls will still block.

If you are concerned about the use of blocking IO, there are lots of projects out there that combine Requests with one of Python's asynchronicity frameworks. Some excellent examples are [requests-threads](https://github.com/requests/requests-threads), [grequests](https://github.com/spyoungtech/grequests), [requests-futures](https://github.com/ross/requests-futures), and [httpx](https://github.com/encode/httpx).

## Header Ordering

In unusual circumstances you may want to provide headers in an ordered manner. If you pass an `OrderedDict` to the `headers` keyword argument, that will provide the headers with an ordering. *However*, the ordering of the default headers used by Requests will be preferred, which means that if you override default headers in the `headers` keyword argument, they may appear out of order compared to other headers in that keyword argument.

If this is problematic, users should consider setting the default headers on a <span class="title-ref">Session \<requests.Session\></span> object, by setting <span class="title-ref">Session.headers \<requests.Session.headers\></span> to a custom `OrderedDict`. That ordering will always be preferred.

## Timeouts

Most requests to external servers should have a timeout attached, in case the server is not responding in a timely manner. By default, requests do not time out unless a timeout value is set explicitly. Without a timeout, your code may hang for minutes or more.

The **connect** timeout is the number of seconds Requests will wait for your client to establish a connection to a remote machine (corresponding to the [connect()](https://linux.die.net/man/2/connect)) call on the socket. It's a good practice to set connect timeouts to slightly larger than a multiple of 3, which is the default [TCP packet retransmission window](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2988).

Once your client has connected to the server and sent the HTTP request, the **read** timeout is the number of seconds the client will wait for the server to send a response. (Specifically, it's the number of seconds that the client will wait *between* bytes sent from the server. In 99.9% of cases, this is the time before the server sends the first byte).

If you specify a single value for the timeout, like this:

    r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=5)

The timeout value will be applied to both the `connect` and the `read` timeouts. Specify a tuple if you would like to set the values separately:

    r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=(3.05, 27))

If the remote server is very slow, you can tell Requests to wait forever for a response, by passing None as a timeout value and then retrieving a cup of coffee.

    r = requests.get('https://github.com', timeout=None)

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

The connect timeout applies to each connection attempt to an IP address. If multiple addresses exist for a domain name, the underlying `urllib3` will try each address sequentially until one successfully connects. This may lead to an effective total connection timeout *multiple* times longer than the specified time, e.g. an unresponsive server having both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses will have its perceived timeout *doubled*, so take that into account when setting the connection timeout.

</div>

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Neither the connect nor read timeouts are [wall clock](https://wiki.php.net/rfc/max_execution_wall_time). This means that if you start a request, and look at the time, and then look at the time when the request finishes or times out, the real-world time may be greater than what you specified.

# Authentication

This document discusses using various kinds of authentication with Requests.

Many web services require authentication, and there are many different types. Below, we outline various forms of authentication available in Requests, from the simple to the complex.

## Basic Authentication

Many web services that require authentication accept HTTP Basic Auth. This is the simplest kind, and Requests supports it straight out of the box.

Making requests with HTTP Basic Auth is very simple:

    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPBasicAuth
    >>> basic = HTTPBasicAuth('user', 'pass')
    >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=basic)
    <Response [200]>

In fact, HTTP Basic Auth is so common that Requests provides a handy shorthand for using it:

    >>> requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
    <Response [200]>

Providing the credentials in a tuple like this is exactly the same as the `HTTPBasicAuth` example above.

### netrc Authentication

If no authentication method is given with the `auth` argument, Requests will attempt to get the authentication credentials for the URL's hostname from the user's netrc file. The netrc file overrides raw HTTP authentication headers set with <span class="title-ref">headers=</span>.

If credentials for the hostname are found, the request is sent with HTTP Basic Auth.

## Digest Authentication

Another very popular form of HTTP Authentication is Digest Authentication, and Requests supports this out of the box as well:

    >>> from requests.auth import HTTPDigestAuth
    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/digest-auth/auth/user/pass'
    >>> requests.get(url, auth=HTTPDigestAuth('user', 'pass'))
    <Response [200]>

## OAuth 1 Authentication

A common form of authentication for several web APIs is OAuth. The `requests-oauthlib` library allows Requests users to easily make OAuth 1 authenticated requests:

    >>> import requests
    >>> from requests_oauthlib import OAuth1
    
    >>> url = 'https://api.twitter.com/1.1/account/verify_credentials.json'
    >>> auth = OAuth1('YOUR_APP_KEY', 'YOUR_APP_SECRET',
    ...               'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN', 'USER_OAUTH_TOKEN_SECRET')
    
    >>> requests.get(url, auth=auth)
    <Response [200]>

For more information on how to OAuth flow works, please see the official [OAuth](https://oauth.net/) website. For examples and documentation on requests-oauthlib, please see the [requests\_oauthlib](https://github.com/requests/requests-oauthlib) repository on GitHub

## OAuth 2 and OpenID Connect Authentication

The `requests-oauthlib` library also handles OAuth 2, the authentication mechanism underpinning OpenID Connect. See the [requests-oauthlib OAuth2 documentation](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html) for details of the various OAuth 2 credential management flows:

  - [Web Application Flow](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html#web-application-flow)
  - [Mobile Application Flow](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html#mobile-application-flow)
  - [Legacy Application Flow](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html#legacy-application-flow)
  - [Backend Application Flow](https://requests-oauthlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oauth2_workflow.html#backend-application-flow)

## Other Authentication

Requests is designed to allow other forms of authentication to be easily and quickly plugged in. Members of the open-source community frequently write authentication handlers for more complicated or less commonly-used forms of authentication. Some of the best have been brought together under the [Requests organization](https://github.com/requests), including:

  - [Kerberos](https://github.com/requests/requests-kerberos)
  - [NTLM](https://github.com/requests/requests-ntlm)

If you want to use any of these forms of authentication, go straight to their GitHub page and follow the instructions.

## New Forms of Authentication

If you can't find a good implementation of the form of authentication you want, you can implement it yourself. Requests makes it easy to add your own forms of authentication.

To do so, subclass <span class="title-ref">AuthBase \<requests.auth.AuthBase\></span> and implement the `__call__()` method:

    >>> import requests
    >>> class MyAuth(requests.auth.AuthBase):
    ...     def __call__(self, r):
    ...         # Implement my authentication
    ...         return r
    ...
    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/get'
    >>> requests.get(url, auth=MyAuth())
    <Response [200]>

When an authentication handler is attached to a request, it is called during request setup. The `__call__` method must therefore do whatever is required to make the authentication work. Some forms of authentication will additionally add hooks to provide further functionality.

Further examples can be found under the [Requests organization](https://github.com/requests) and in the `auth.py` file.

# Quickstart

<div class="module">

requests.models

</div>

Eager to get started? This page gives a good introduction in how to get started with Requests.

First, make sure that:

  - Requests is \[installed \<install\>\](\#installed-\<install\>)
  - Requests is \[up-to-date \<updates\>\](\#up-to-date-\<updates\>)

Let's get started with some simple examples.

## Make a Request

Making a request with Requests is very simple.

Begin by importing the Requests module:

    >>> import requests

Now, let's try to get a webpage. For this example, let's get GitHub's public timeline:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')

Now, we have a <span class="title-ref">Response \<requests.Response\></span> object called `r`. We can get all the information we need from this object.

Requests' simple API means that all forms of HTTP request are as obvious. For example, this is how you make an HTTP POST request:

    >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data={'key': 'value'})

Nice, right? What about the other HTTP request types: PUT, DELETE, HEAD and OPTIONS? These are all just as simple:

    >>> r = requests.put('https://httpbin.org/put', data={'key': 'value'})
    >>> r = requests.delete('https://httpbin.org/delete')
    >>> r = requests.head('https://httpbin.org/get')
    >>> r = requests.options('https://httpbin.org/get')

That's all well and good, but it's also only the start of what Requests can do.

## Passing Parameters In URLs

You often want to send some sort of data in the URL's query string. If you were constructing the URL by hand, this data would be given as key/value pairs in the URL after a question mark, e.g. `httpbin.org/get?key=val`. Requests allows you to provide these arguments as a dictionary of strings, using the `params` keyword argument. As an example, if you wanted to pass `key1=value1` and `key2=value2` to `httpbin.org/get`, you would use the following code:

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)

You can see that the URL has been correctly encoded by printing the URL:

    >>> print(r.url)
    https://httpbin.org/get?key2=value2&key1=value1

Note that any dictionary key whose value is `None` will not be added to the URL's query string.

You can also pass a list of items as a value:

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': ['value2', 'value3']}
    
    >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get', params=payload)
    >>> print(r.url)
    https://httpbin.org/get?key1=value1&key2=value2&key2=value3

## Response Content

We can read the content of the server's response. Consider the GitHub timeline again:

    >>> import requests
    
    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
    >>> r.text
    '[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...

Requests will automatically decode content from the server. Most unicode charsets are seamlessly decoded.

When you make a request, Requests makes educated guesses about the encoding of the response based on the HTTP headers. The text encoding guessed by Requests is used when you access `r.text`. You can find out what encoding Requests is using, and change it, using the `r.encoding` property:

    >>> r.encoding
    'utf-8'
    >>> r.encoding = 'ISO-8859-1'

If you change the encoding, Requests will use the new value of `r.encoding` whenever you call `r.text`. You might want to do this in any situation where you can apply special logic to work out what the encoding of the content will be. For example, HTML and XML have the ability to specify their encoding in their body. In situations like this, you should use `r.content` to find the encoding, and then set `r.encoding`. This will let you use `r.text` with the correct encoding.

Requests will also use custom encodings in the event that you need them. If you have created your own encoding and registered it with the `codecs` module, you can simply use the codec name as the value of `r.encoding` and Requests will handle the decoding for you.

## Binary Response Content

You can also access the response body as bytes, for non-text requests:

    >>> r.content
    b'[{"repository":{"open_issues":0,"url":"https://github.com/...

The `gzip` and `deflate` transfer-encodings are automatically decoded for you.

The `br` transfer-encoding is automatically decoded for you if a Brotli library like [brotli](https://pypi.org/project/brotli) or [brotlicffi](https://pypi.org/project/brotlicffi) is installed.

For example, to create an image from binary data returned by a request, you can use the following code:

    >>> from PIL import Image
    >>> from io import BytesIO
    
    >>> i = Image.open(BytesIO(r.content))

## JSON Response Content

There's also a builtin JSON decoder, in case you're dealing with JSON data:

    >>> import requests
    
    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events')
    >>> r.json()
    [{'repository': {'open_issues': 0, 'url': 'https://github.com/...

In case the JSON decoding fails, `r.json()` raises an exception. For example, if the response gets a 204 (No Content), or if the response contains invalid JSON, attempting `r.json()` raises `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError`. This wrapper exception provides interoperability for multiple exceptions that may be thrown by different python versions and json serialization libraries.

It should be noted that the success of the call to `r.json()` does **not** indicate the success of the response. Some servers may return a JSON object in a failed response (e.g. error details with HTTP 500). Such JSON will be decoded and returned. To check that a request is successful, use `r.raise_for_status()` or check `r.status_code` is what you expect.

## Raw Response Content

In the rare case that you'd like to get the raw socket response from the server, you can access `r.raw`. If you want to do this, make sure you set `stream=True` in your initial request. Once you do, you can do this:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://api.github.com/events', stream=True)
    
    >>> r.raw
    <urllib3.response.HTTPResponse object at 0x101194810>
    
    >>> r.raw.read(10)
    b'\x1f\x8b\x08\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x03'

In general, however, you should use a pattern like this to save what is being streamed to a file:

    with open(filename, 'wb') as fd:
        for chunk in r.iter_content(chunk_size=128):
            fd.write(chunk)

Using `Response.iter_content` will handle a lot of what you would otherwise have to handle when using `Response.raw` directly. When streaming a download, the above is the preferred and recommended way to retrieve the content. Note that `chunk_size` can be freely adjusted to a number that may better fit your use cases.

\> **Note** \> An important note about using `Response.iter_content` versus `Response.raw`. `Response.iter_content` will automatically decode the `gzip` and `deflate` transfer-encodings. `Response.raw` is a raw stream of bytes -- it does not transform the response content. If you really need access to the bytes as they were returned, use `Response.raw`.

## Custom Headers

If you'd like to add HTTP headers to a request, simply pass in a `dict` to the `headers` parameter.

For example, we didn't specify our user-agent in the previous example:

    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
    >>> headers = {'user-agent': 'my-app/0.0.1'}
    
    >>> r = requests.get(url, headers=headers)

Note: Custom headers are given less precedence than more specific sources of information. For instance:

  - Authorization headers set with <span class="title-ref">headers=</span> will be overridden if credentials are specified in `.netrc`, which in turn will be overridden by the `auth=` parameter. Requests will search for the netrc file at <span class="title-ref">\~/.netrc</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~/\_netrc</span>, or at the path specified by the <span class="title-ref">NETRC</span> environment variable.
  - Authorization headers will be removed if you get redirected off-host.
  - Proxy-Authorization headers will be overridden by proxy credentials provided in the URL.
  - Content-Length headers will be overridden when we can determine the length of the content.

Furthermore, Requests does not change its behavior at all based on which custom headers are specified. The headers are simply passed on into the final request.

Note: All header values must be a `string`, bytestring, or unicode. While permitted, it's advised to avoid passing unicode header values.

## More complicated POST requests

Typically, you want to send some form-encoded data — much like an HTML form. To do this, simply pass a dictionary to the `data` argument. Your dictionary of data will automatically be form-encoded when the request is made:

    >>> payload = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
    
    >>> r = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload)
    >>> print(r.text)
    {
      ...
      "form": {
        "key2": "value2",
        "key1": "value1"
      },
      ...
    }

The `data` argument can also have multiple values for each key. This can be done by making `data` either a list of tuples or a dictionary with lists as values. This is particularly useful when the form has multiple elements that use the same key:

    >>> payload_tuples = [('key1', 'value1'), ('key1', 'value2')]
    >>> r1 = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload_tuples)
    >>> payload_dict = {'key1': ['value1', 'value2']}
    >>> r2 = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data=payload_dict)
    >>> print(r1.text)
    {
      ...
      "form": {
        "key1": [
          "value1",
          "value2"
        ]
      },
      ...
    }
    >>> r1.text == r2.text
    True

There are times that you may want to send data that is not form-encoded. If you pass in a `string` instead of a `dict`, that data will be posted directly.

For example, the GitHub API v3 accepts JSON-Encoded POST/PATCH data:

    >>> import json
    
    >>> url = 'https://api.github.com/some/endpoint'
    >>> payload = {'some': 'data'}
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url, data=json.dumps(payload))

Please note that the above code will NOT add the `Content-Type` header (so in particular it will NOT set it to `application/json`).

If you need that header set and you don't want to encode the `dict` yourself, you can also pass it directly using the `json` parameter (added in version 2.4.2) and it will be encoded automatically:

> \>\>\> url = '<https://api.github.com/some/endpoint>' \>\>\> payload = {'some': 'data'}
> 
> \>\>\> r = requests.post(url, json=payload)

Note, the `json` parameter is ignored if either `data` or `files` is passed.

## POST a Multipart-Encoded File

Requests makes it simple to upload Multipart-encoded files:

    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
    >>> files = {'file': open('report.xls', 'rb')}
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
    >>> r.text
    {
      ...
      "files": {
        "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
      },
      ...
    }

You can set the filename, content\_type and headers explicitly:

    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
    >>> files = {'file': ('report.xls', open('report.xls', 'rb'), 'application/vnd.ms-excel', {'Expires': '0'})}
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
    >>> r.text
    {
      ...
      "files": {
        "file": "<censored...binary...data>"
      },
      ...
    }

If you want, you can send strings to be received as files:

    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/post'
    >>> files = {'file': ('report.csv', 'some,data,to,send\nanother,row,to,send\n')}
    
    >>> r = requests.post(url, files=files)
    >>> r.text
    {
      ...
      "files": {
        "file": "some,data,to,send\\nanother,row,to,send\\n"
      },
      ...
    }

In the event you are posting a very large file as a `multipart/form-data` request, you may want to stream the request. By default, `requests` does not support this, but there is a separate package which does -`requests-toolbelt`. You should read [the toolbelt's documentation](https://toolbelt.readthedocs.io) for more details about how to use it.

For sending multiple files in one request refer to the \[advanced \<advanced\>\](\#advanced-\<advanced\>) section.

<div class="warning">

<div class="title">

Warning

</div>

It is strongly recommended that you open files in \[binary mode \<tut-files\>\](\#binary

</div>

  - \-------------mode-\<tut-files\>). This is because Requests may attempt to provide  
    the `Content-Length` header for you, and if it does this value will be set to the number of *bytes* in the file. Errors may occur if you open the file in *text mode*.

## Response Status Codes

We can check the response status code:

    >>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/get')
    >>> r.status_code
    200

Requests also comes with a built-in status code lookup object for easy reference:

    >>> r.status_code == requests.codes.ok
    True

If we made a bad request (a 4XX client error or 5XX server error response), we can raise it with \`Response.raise\_for\_status() \<requests.Response.raise\_for\_status\>\`:

    >>> bad_r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/status/404')
    >>> bad_r.status_code
    404
    
    >>> bad_r.raise_for_status()
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "requests/models.py", line 832, in raise_for_status
        raise http_error
    requests.exceptions.HTTPError: 404 Client Error

But, since our `status_code` for `r` was `200`, when we call `raise_for_status()` we get:

    >>> r.raise_for_status()
    None

All is well.

## Response Headers

We can view the server's response headers using a Python dictionary:

    >>> r.headers
    {
        'content-encoding': 'gzip',
        'transfer-encoding': 'chunked',
        'connection': 'close',
        'server': 'nginx/1.0.4',
        'x-runtime': '148ms',
        'etag': '"e1ca502697e5c9317743dc078f67693f"',
        'content-type': 'application/json'
    }

The dictionary is special, though: it's made just for HTTP headers. According to [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2), HTTP Header names are case-insensitive.

So, we can access the headers using any capitalization we want:

    >>> r.headers['Content-Type']
    'application/json'
    
    >>> r.headers.get('content-type')
    'application/json'

It is also special in that the server could have sent the same header multiple times with different values, but requests combines them so they can be represented in the dictionary within a single mapping, as per [RFC 7230](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7230#section-3.2):

> A recipient MAY combine multiple header fields with the same field name into one "field-name: field-value" pair, without changing the semantics of the message, by appending each subsequent field value to the combined field value in order, separated by a comma.

## Cookies

If a response contains some Cookies, you can quickly access them:

    >>> url = 'http://example.com/some/cookie/setting/url'
    >>> r = requests.get(url)
    
    >>> r.cookies['example_cookie_name']
    'example_cookie_value'

To send your own cookies to the server, you can use the `cookies` parameter:

    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
    >>> cookies = dict(cookies_are='working')
    
    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=cookies)
    >>> r.text
    '{"cookies": {"cookies_are": "working"}}'

Cookies are returned in a <span class="title-ref">\~requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar</span>, which acts like a `dict` but also offers a more complete interface, suitable for use over multiple domains or paths. Cookie jars can also be passed in to requests:

    >>> jar = requests.cookies.RequestsCookieJar()
    >>> jar.set('tasty_cookie', 'yum', domain='httpbin.org', path='/cookies')
    >>> jar.set('gross_cookie', 'blech', domain='httpbin.org', path='/elsewhere')
    >>> url = 'https://httpbin.org/cookies'
    >>> r = requests.get(url, cookies=jar)
    >>> r.text
    '{"cookies": {"tasty_cookie": "yum"}}'

## Redirection and History

By default Requests will perform location redirection for all verbs except HEAD.

We can use the `history` property of the Response object to track redirection.

The <span class="title-ref">Response.history \<requests.Response.history\></span> list contains the <span class="title-ref">Response \<requests.Response\></span> objects that were created in order to complete the request. The list is sorted from the oldest to the most recent response.

For example, GitHub redirects all HTTP requests to HTTPS:

    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com/')
    
    >>> r.url
    'https://github.com/'
    
    >>> r.status_code
    200
    
    >>> r.history
    [<Response [301]>]

If you're using GET, OPTIONS, POST, PUT, PATCH or DELETE, you can disable redirection handling with the `allow_redirects` parameter:

    >>> r = requests.get('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=False)
    
    >>> r.status_code
    301
    
    >>> r.history
    []

If you're using HEAD, you can enable redirection as well:

    >>> r = requests.head('http://github.com/', allow_redirects=True)
    
    >>> r.url
    'https://github.com/'
    
    >>> r.history
    [<Response [301]>]

## Timeouts

You can tell Requests to stop waiting for a response after a given number of seconds with the `timeout` parameter. Nearly all production code should use this parameter in nearly all requests. Failure to do so can cause your program to hang indefinitely:

    >>> requests.get('https://github.com/', timeout=0.001)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
      File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
    requests.exceptions.Timeout: HTTPConnectionPool(host='github.com', port=80): Request timed out. (timeout=0.001)

<div class="admonition">

Note

`timeout` is not a time limit on the entire response download; rather, an exception is raised if the server has not issued a response for `timeout` seconds (more precisely, if no bytes have been received on the underlying socket for `timeout` seconds). If no timeout is specified explicitly, requests do not time out.

</div>

## Errors and Exceptions

In the event of a network problem (e.g. DNS failure, refused connection, etc), Requests will raise a <span class="title-ref">\~requests.exceptions.ConnectionError</span> exception.

<span class="title-ref">Response.raise\_for\_status() \<requests.Response.raise\_for\_status\></span> will raise an <span class="title-ref">\~requests.exceptions.HTTPError</span> if the HTTP request returned an unsuccessful status code.

If a request times out, a <span class="title-ref">\~requests.exceptions.Timeout</span> exception is raised.

If a request exceeds the configured number of maximum redirections, a <span class="title-ref">\~requests.exceptions.TooManyRedirects</span> exception is raised.

All exceptions that Requests explicitly raises inherit from <span class="title-ref">requests.exceptions.RequestException</span>.

Release History
===============

- \[Short description of non-trivial change.\]

2.32.3 (2024-05-29)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug breaking the ability to specify custom SSLContexts in sub-classes of
  HTTPAdapter. (#6716)
- Fixed issue where Requests started failing to run on Python versions compiled
  without the `ssl` module. (#6724)

2.32.2 (2024-05-21)
-------------------

**Deprecations**
- To provide a more stable migration for custom HTTPAdapters impacted
  by the CVE changes in 2.32.0, we've renamed `_get_connection` to
  a new public API, `get_connection_with_tls_context`. Existing custom
  HTTPAdapters will need to migrate their code to use this new API.
  `get_connection` is considered deprecated in all versions of Requests>=2.32.0.

  A minimal (2-line) example has been provided in the linked PR to ease
  migration, but we strongly urge users to evaluate if their custom adapter
  is subject to the same issue described in CVE-2024-35195. (#6710)

2.32.1 (2024-05-20)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**
- Add missing test certs to the sdist distributed on PyPI.


2.32.0 (2024-05-20)
-------------------

**Security**
- Fixed an issue where setting `verify=False` on the first request from a
  Session will cause subsequent requests to the _same origin_ to also ignore
  cert verification, regardless of the value of `verify`.
  (https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-9wx4-h78v-vm56)

**Improvements**
- `verify=True` now reuses a global SSLContext which should improve
  request time variance between first and subsequent requests. It should
  also minimize certificate load time on Windows systems when using a Python
  version built with OpenSSL 3.x. (#6667)
- Requests now supports optional use of character detection
  (`chardet` or `charset_normalizer`) when repackaged or vendored.
  This enables `pip` and other projects to minimize their vendoring
  surface area. The `Response.text()` and `apparent_encoding` APIs
  will default to `utf-8` if neither library is present. (#6702)

**Bugfixes**
- Fixed bug in length detection where emoji length was incorrectly
  calculated in the request content-length. (#6589)
- Fixed deserialization bug in JSONDecodeError. (#6629)
- Fixed bug where an extra leading `/` (path separator) could lead
  urllib3 to unnecessarily reparse the request URI. (#6644)

**Deprecations**

- Requests has officially added support for CPython 3.12 (#6503)
- Requests has officially added support for PyPy 3.9 and 3.10 (#6641)
- Requests has officially dropped support for CPython 3.7 (#6642)
- Requests has officially dropped support for PyPy 3.7 and 3.8 (#6641)

**Documentation**
- Various typo fixes and doc improvements.

**Packaging**
- Requests has started adopting some modern packaging practices.
  The source files for the projects (formerly `requests`) is now located
  in `src/requests` in the Requests sdist. (#6506)
- Starting in Requests 2.33.0, Requests will migrate to a PEP 517 build system
  using `hatchling`. This should not impact the average user, but extremely old
  versions of packaging utilities may have issues with the new packaging format.


2.31.0 (2023-05-22)
-------------------

**Security**
- Versions of Requests between v2.3.0 and v2.30.0 are vulnerable to potential
  forwarding of `Proxy-Authorization` headers to destination servers when
  following HTTPS redirects.

  When proxies are defined with user info (`https://user:pass@proxy:8080`), Requests
  will construct a `Proxy-Authorization` header that is attached to the request to
  authenticate with the proxy.

  In cases where Requests receives a redirect response, it previously reattached
  the `Proxy-Authorization` header incorrectly, resulting in the value being
  sent through the tunneled connection to the destination server. Users who rely on
  defining their proxy credentials in the URL are *strongly* encouraged to upgrade
  to Requests 2.31.0+ to prevent unintentional leakage and rotate their proxy
  credentials once the change has been fully deployed.

  Users who do not use a proxy or do not supply their proxy credentials through
  the user information portion of their proxy URL are not subject to this
  vulnerability.

  Full details can be read in our [Github Security Advisory](https://github.com/psf/requests/security/advisories/GHSA-j8r2-6x86-q33q)
  and [CVE-2023-32681](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32681).


2.30.0 (2023-05-03)
-------------------

**Dependencies**
- ⚠️ Added support for urllib3 2.0. ⚠️

  This may contain minor breaking changes so we advise careful testing and
  reviewing https://urllib3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/v2-migration-guide.html
  prior to upgrading.

  Users who wish to stay on urllib3 1.x can pin to `urllib3<2`.

2.29.0 (2023-04-26)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Requests now defers chunked requests to the urllib3 implementation to improve
  standardization. (#6226)
- Requests relaxes header component requirements to support bytes/str subclasses. (#6356)

2.28.2 (2023-01-12)
-------------------

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports charset\_normalizer 3.x. (#6261)

**Bugfixes**

- Updated MissingSchema exception to suggest https scheme rather than http. (#6188)

2.28.1 (2022-06-29)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Speed optimization in `iter_content` with transition to `yield from`. (#6170)

**Dependencies**

- Added support for chardet 5.0.0 (#6179)
- Added support for charset-normalizer 2.1.0 (#6169)

2.28.0 (2022-06-09)
-------------------

**Deprecations**

- ⚠️ Requests has officially dropped support for Python 2.7. ⚠️ (#6091)
- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.6 (including pypy3.6). (#6091)

**Improvements**

- Wrap JSON parsing issues in Request's JSONDecodeError for payloads without
  an encoding to make `json()` API consistent. (#6097)
- Parse header components consistently, raising an InvalidHeader error in
  all invalid cases. (#6154)
- Added provisional 3.11 support with current beta build. (#6155)
- Requests got a makeover and we decided to paint it black. (#6095)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug where setting `CURL_CA_BUNDLE` to an empty string would disable
  cert verification. All Requests 2.x versions before 2.28.0 are affected. (#6074)
- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.SSLError` with
  `requests.exceptions.SSLError` for `content` and `iter_content`. (#6057)
- Fixed issue where invalid Windows registry entries caused proxy resolution
  to raise an exception rather than ignoring the entry. (#6149)
- Fixed issue where entire payload could be included in the error message for
  JSONDecodeError. (#6036)

2.27.1 (2022-01-05)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed parsing issue that resulted in the `auth` component being
  dropped from proxy URLs. (#6028)

2.27.0 (2022-01-03)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Officially added support for Python 3.10. (#5928)

- Added a `requests.exceptions.JSONDecodeError` to unify JSON exceptions between
  Python 2 and 3. This gets raised in the `response.json()` method, and is
  backwards compatible as it inherits from previously thrown exceptions.
  Can be caught from `requests.exceptions.RequestException` as well. (#5856)

- Improved error text for misnamed `InvalidSchema` and `MissingSchema`
  exceptions. This is a temporary fix until exceptions can be renamed
  (Schema->Scheme). (#6017)

- Improved proxy parsing for proxy URLs missing a scheme. This will address
  recent changes to `urlparse` in Python 3.9+. (#5917)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed defect in `extract_zipped_paths` which could result in an infinite loop
  for some paths. (#5851)

- Fixed handling for `AttributeError` when calculating length of files obtained
  by `Tarfile.extractfile()`. (#5239)

- Fixed urllib3 exception leak, wrapping `urllib3.exceptions.InvalidHeader` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidHeader`. (#5914)

- Fixed bug where two Host headers were sent for chunked requests. (#5391)

- Fixed regression in Requests 2.26.0 where `Proxy-Authorization` was
  incorrectly stripped from all requests sent with `Session.send`. (#5924)

- Fixed performance regression in 2.26.0 for hosts with a large number of
  proxies available in the environment. (#5924)

- Fixed idna exception leak, wrapping `UnicodeError` with
  `requests.exceptions.InvalidURL` for URLs with a leading dot (.) in the
  domain. (#5414)

**Deprecations**

- Requests support for Python 2.7 and 3.6 will be ending in 2022. While we
  don't have exact dates, Requests 2.27.x is likely to be the last release
  series providing support.

2.26.0 (2021-07-13)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Requests now supports Brotli compression, if either the `brotli` or
  `brotlicffi` package is installed. (#5783)

- `Session.send` now correctly resolves proxy configurations from both
  the Session and Request. Behavior now matches `Session.request`. (#5681)

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed a race condition in zip extraction when using Requests in parallel
  from zip archive. (#5707)

**Dependencies**

- Instead of `chardet`, use the MIT-licensed `charset_normalizer` for Python3
  to remove license ambiguity for projects bundling requests. If `chardet`
  is already installed on your machine it will be used instead of `charset_normalizer`
  to keep backwards compatibility. (#5797)

  You can also install `chardet` while installing requests by
  specifying `[use_chardet_on_py3]` extra as follows:

    ```shell
    pip install "requests[use_chardet_on_py3]"
    ```

  Python2 still depends upon the `chardet` module.

- Requests now supports `idna` 3.x on Python 3. `idna` 2.x will continue to
  be used on Python 2 installations. (#5711)

**Deprecations**

- The `requests[security]` extra has been converted to a no-op install.
  PyOpenSSL is no longer the recommended secure option for Requests. (#5867)

- Requests has officially dropped support for Python 3.5. (#5867)

2.25.1 (2020-12-16)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Requests now treats `application/json` as `utf8` by default. Resolving
  inconsistencies between `r.text` and `r.json` output. (#5673)

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports chardet v4.x.

2.25.0 (2020-11-11)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Added support for NETRC environment variable. (#5643)

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports urllib3 v1.26.

**Deprecations**

- Requests v2.25.x will be the last release series with support for Python 3.5.
- The `requests[security]` extra is officially deprecated and will be removed
  in Requests v2.26.0.

2.24.0 (2020-06-17)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- pyOpenSSL TLS implementation is now only used if Python
  either doesn't have an `ssl` module or doesn't support
  SNI. Previously pyOpenSSL was unconditionally used if available.
  This applies even if pyOpenSSL is installed via the
  `requests[security]` extra (#5443)

- Redirect resolution should now only occur when
  `allow_redirects` is True. (#5492)

- No longer perform unnecessary Content-Length calculation for
  requests that won't use it. (#5496)

2.23.0 (2020-02-19)
-------------------

**Improvements**

- Remove defunct reference to `prefetch` in Session `__attrs__` (#5110)

**Bugfixes**

- Requests no longer outputs password in basic auth usage warning. (#5099)

**Dependencies**

- Pinning for `chardet` and `idna` now uses major version instead of minor.
  This hopefully reduces the need for releases every time a dependency is updated.

2.22.0 (2019-05-15)
-------------------

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports urllib3 v1.25.2.
  (note: 1.25.0 and 1.25.1 are incompatible)

**Deprecations**

- Requests has officially stopped support for Python 3.4.

2.21.0 (2018-12-10)
-------------------

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports idna v2.8.

2.20.1 (2018-11-08)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

- Fixed bug with unintended Authorization header stripping for
  redirects using default ports (http/80, https/443).

2.20.0 (2018-10-18)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Content-Type header parsing is now case-insensitive (e.g.
    charset=utf8 v Charset=utf8).
-   Fixed exception leak where certain redirect urls would raise
    uncaught urllib3 exceptions.
-   Requests removes Authorization header from requests redirected
    from https to http on the same hostname. (CVE-2018-18074)
-   `should_bypass_proxies` now handles URIs without hostnames (e.g.
    files).

**Dependencies**

- Requests now supports urllib3 v1.24.

**Deprecations**

- Requests has officially stopped support for Python 2.6.

2.19.1 (2018-06-14)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed issue where status\_codes.py's `init` function failed trying
    to append to a `__doc__` value of `None`.

2.19.0 (2018-06-12)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Warn user about possible slowdown when using cryptography version
    &lt; 1.3.4
-   Check for invalid host in proxy URL, before forwarding request to
    adapter.
-   Fragments are now properly maintained across redirects. (RFC7231
    7.1.2)
-   Removed use of cgi module to expedite library load time.
-   Added support for SHA-256 and SHA-512 digest auth algorithms.
-   Minor performance improvement to `Request.content`.
-   Migrate to using collections.abc for 3.7 compatibility.

**Bugfixes**

-   Parsing empty `Link` headers with `parse_header_links()` no longer
    return one bogus entry.
-   Fixed issue where loading the default certificate bundle from a zip
    archive would raise an `IOError`.
-   Fixed issue with unexpected `ImportError` on windows system which do
    not support `winreg` module.
-   DNS resolution in proxy bypass no longer includes the username and
    password in the request. This also fixes the issue of DNS queries
    failing on macOS.
-   Properly normalize adapter prefixes for url comparison.
-   Passing `None` as a file pointer to the `files` param no longer
    raises an exception.
-   Calling `copy` on a `RequestsCookieJar` will now preserve the cookie
    policy correctly.

**Dependencies**

-   We now support idna v2.7.
-   We now support urllib3 v1.23.

2.18.4 (2017-08-15)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Error messages for invalid headers now include the header name for
    easier debugging

**Dependencies**

-   We now support idna v2.6.

2.18.3 (2017-08-02)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Running `$ python -m requests.help` now includes the installed
    version of idna.

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed issue where Requests would raise `ConnectionError` instead of
    `SSLError` when encountering SSL problems when using urllib3 v1.22.

2.18.2 (2017-07-25)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   `requests.help` no longer fails on Python 2.6 due to the absence of
    `ssl.OPENSSL_VERSION_NUMBER`.

**Dependencies**

-   We now support urllib3 v1.22.

2.18.1 (2017-06-14)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fix an error in the packaging whereby the `*.whl` contained
    incorrect data that regressed the fix in v2.17.3.

2.18.0 (2017-06-14)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   `Response` is now a context manager, so can be used directly in a
    `with` statement without first having to be wrapped by
    `contextlib.closing()`.

**Bugfixes**

-   Resolve installation failure if multiprocessing is not available
-   Resolve tests crash if multiprocessing is not able to determine the
    number of CPU cores
-   Resolve error swallowing in utils set\_environ generator

2.17.3 (2017-05-29)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
    libraries.

2.17.2 (2017-05-29)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
    libraries.

2.17.1 (2017-05-29)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Improved `packages` namespace identity support, for monkeypatching
    libraries.

2.17.0 (2017-05-29)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Removal of the 301 redirect cache. This improves thread-safety.

2.16.5 (2017-05-28)
-------------------

-   Improvements to `$ python -m requests.help`.

2.16.4 (2017-05-27)
-------------------

-   Introduction of the `$ python -m requests.help` command, for
    debugging with maintainers!

2.16.3 (2017-05-27)
-------------------

-   Further restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility
    reasons.

2.16.2 (2017-05-27)
-------------------

-   Further restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility
    reasons.

No code modification (noted below) should be necessary any longer.

2.16.1 (2017-05-27)
-------------------

-   Restored the `requests.packages` namespace for compatibility
    reasons.
-   Bugfix for `urllib3` version parsing.

**Note**: code that was written to import against the
`requests.packages` namespace previously will have to import code that
rests at this module-level now.

For example:

    from requests.packages.urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

Will need to be re-written to be:

    from requests.packages import urllib3
    urllib3.poolmanager.PoolManager

Or, even better:

    from urllib3.poolmanager import PoolManager

2.16.0 (2017-05-26)
-------------------

-   Unvendor ALL the things!

2.15.1 (2017-05-26)
-------------------

-   Everyone makes mistakes.

2.15.0 (2017-05-26)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Introduction of the `Response.next` property, for getting the next
    `PreparedResponse` from a redirect chain (when
    `allow_redirects=False`).
-   Internal refactoring of `__version__` module.

**Bugfixes**

-   Restored once-optional parameter for
    `requests.utils.get_environ_proxies()`.

2.14.2 (2017-05-10)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Changed a less-than to an equal-to and an or in the dependency
    markers to widen compatibility with older setuptools releases.

2.14.1 (2017-05-09)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Changed the dependency markers to widen compatibility with older pip
    releases.

2.14.0 (2017-05-09)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   It is now possible to pass `no_proxy` as a key to the `proxies`
    dictionary to provide handling similar to the `NO_PROXY` environment
    variable.
-   When users provide invalid paths to certificate bundle files or
    directories Requests now raises `IOError`, rather than failing at
    the time of the HTTPS request with a fairly inscrutable certificate
    validation error.
-   The behavior of `SessionRedirectMixin` was slightly altered.
    `resolve_redirects` will now detect a redirect by calling
    `get_redirect_target(response)` instead of directly querying
    `Response.is_redirect` and `Response.headers['location']`. Advanced
    users will be able to process malformed redirects more easily.
-   Changed the internal calculation of elapsed request time to have
    higher resolution on Windows.
-   Added `win_inet_pton` as conditional dependency for the `[socks]`
    extra on Windows with Python 2.7.
-   Changed the proxy bypass implementation on Windows: the proxy bypass
    check doesn't use forward and reverse DNS requests anymore
-   URLs with schemes that begin with `http` but are not `http` or
    `https` no longer have their host parts forced to lowercase.

**Bugfixes**

-   Much improved handling of non-ASCII `Location` header values in
    redirects. Fewer `UnicodeDecodeErrors` are encountered on Python 2,
    and Python 3 now correctly understands that Latin-1 is unlikely to
    be the correct encoding.
-   If an attempt to `seek` file to find out its length fails, we now
    appropriately handle that by aborting our content-length
    calculations.
-   Restricted `HTTPDigestAuth` to only respond to auth challenges made
    on 4XX responses, rather than to all auth challenges.
-   Fixed some code that was firing `DeprecationWarning` on Python 3.6.
-   The dismayed person emoticon (`/o\\`) no longer has a big head. I'm
    sure this is what you were all worrying about most.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to v1.21.1.
-   Updated bundled chardet to v3.0.2.
-   Updated bundled idna to v2.5.
-   Updated bundled certifi to 2017.4.17.

2.13.0 (2017-01-24)
-------------------

**Features**

-   Only load the `idna` library when we've determined we need it. This
    will save some memory for users.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.20.
-   Updated bundled idna to 2.2.

2.12.5 (2017-01-18)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed an issue with JSON encoding detection, specifically detecting
    big-endian UTF-32 with BOM.

2.12.4 (2016-12-14)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed regression from 2.12.2 where non-string types were rejected in
    the basic auth parameters. While support for this behaviour has been
    re-added, the behaviour is deprecated and will be removed in the
    future.

2.12.3 (2016-12-01)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed regression from v2.12.1 for URLs with schemes that begin with
    "http". These URLs have historically been processed as though they
    were HTTP-schemed URLs, and so have had parameters added. This was
    removed in v2.12.2 in an overzealous attempt to resolve problems
    with IDNA-encoding those URLs. This change was reverted: the other
    fixes for IDNA-encoding have been judged to be sufficient to return
    to the behaviour Requests had before v2.12.0.

2.12.2 (2016-11-30)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed several issues with IDNA-encoding URLs that are technically
    invalid but which are widely accepted. Requests will now attempt to
    IDNA-encode a URL if it can but, if it fails, and the host contains
    only ASCII characters, it will be passed through optimistically.
    This will allow users to opt-in to using IDNA2003 themselves if they
    want to, and will also allow technically invalid but still common
    hostnames.
-   Fixed an issue where URLs with leading whitespace would raise
    `InvalidSchema` errors.
-   Fixed an issue where some URLs without the HTTP or HTTPS schemes
    would still have HTTP URL preparation applied to them.
-   Fixed an issue where Unicode strings could not be used in basic
    auth.
-   Fixed an issue encountered by some Requests plugins where
    constructing a Response object would cause `Response.content` to
    raise an `AttributeError`.

2.12.1 (2016-11-16)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Updated setuptools 'security' extra for the new PyOpenSSL backend in
    urllib3.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.1.

2.12.0 (2016-11-15)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Updated support for internationalized domain names from IDNA2003 to
    IDNA2008. This updated support is required for several forms of IDNs
    and is mandatory for .de domains.
-   Much improved heuristics for guessing content lengths: Requests will
    no longer read an entire `StringIO` into memory.
-   Much improved logic for recalculating `Content-Length` headers for
    `PreparedRequest` objects.
-   Improved tolerance for file-like objects that have no `tell` method
    but do have a `seek` method.
-   Anything that is a subclass of `Mapping` is now treated like a
    dictionary by the `data=` keyword argument.
-   Requests now tolerates empty passwords in proxy credentials, rather
    than stripping the credentials.
-   If a request is made with a file-like object as the body and that
    request is redirected with a 307 or 308 status code, Requests will
    now attempt to rewind the body object so it can be replayed.

**Bugfixes**

-   When calling `response.close`, the call to `close` will be
    propagated through to non-urllib3 backends.
-   Fixed issue where the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable would be
    preferred over scheme-specific variables like `HTTP_PROXY`.
-   Fixed issue where non-UTF8 reason phrases got severely mangled by
    falling back to decoding using ISO 8859-1 instead.
-   Fixed a bug where Requests would not correctly correlate cookies set
    when using custom Host headers if those Host headers did not use the
    native string type for the platform.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.19.
-   Updated bundled certifi certs to 2016.09.26.

2.11.1 (2016-08-17)
-------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed a bug when using `iter_content` with `decode_unicode=True` for
    streamed bodies would raise `AttributeError`. This bug was
    introduced in 2.11.
-   Strip Content-Type and Transfer-Encoding headers from the header
    block when following a redirect that transforms the verb from
    POST/PUT to GET.

2.11.0 (2016-08-08)
-------------------

**Improvements**

-   Added support for the `ALL_PROXY` environment variable.
-   Reject header values that contain leading whitespace or newline
    characters to reduce risk of header smuggling.

**Bugfixes**

-   Fixed occasional `TypeError` when attempting to decode a JSON
    response that occurred in an error case. Now correctly returns a
    `ValueError`.
-   Requests would incorrectly ignore a non-CIDR IP address in the
    `NO_PROXY` environment variables: Requests now treats it as a
    specific IP.
-   Fixed a bug when sending JSON data that could cause us to encounter
    obscure OpenSSL errors in certain network conditions (yes, really).
-   Added type checks to ensure that `iter_content` only accepts
    integers and `None` for chunk sizes.
-   Fixed issue where responses whose body had not been fully consumed
    would have the underlying connection closed but not returned to the
    connection pool, which could cause Requests to hang in situations
    where the `HTTPAdapter` had been configured to use a blocking
    connection pool.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.16.
-   Some previous releases accidentally accepted non-strings as
    acceptable header values. This release does not.

2.10.0 (2016-04-29)
-------------------

**New Features**

-   SOCKS Proxy Support! (requires PySocks;
    `$ pip install requests[socks]`)

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.15.1.

2.9.2 (2016-04-29)
------------------

**Improvements**

-   Change built-in CaseInsensitiveDict (used for headers) to use
    OrderedDict as its underlying datastore.

**Bugfixes**

-   Don't use redirect\_cache if allow\_redirects=False
-   When passed objects that throw exceptions from `tell()`, send them
    via chunked transfer encoding instead of failing.
-   Raise a ProxyError for proxy related connection issues.

2.9.1 (2015-12-21)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Resolve regression introduced in 2.9.0 that made it impossible to
    send binary strings as bodies in Python 3.
-   Fixed errors when calculating cookie expiration dates in certain
    locales.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated bundled urllib3 to 1.13.1.

2.9.0 (2015-12-15)
------------------

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards compatible)

-   The `verify` keyword argument now supports being passed a path to a
    directory of CA certificates, not just a single-file bundle.
-   Warnings are now emitted when sending files opened in text mode.
-   Added the 511 Network Authentication Required status code to the
    status code registry.

**Bugfixes**

-   For file-like objects that are not sought to the very beginning, we
    now send the content length for the number of bytes we will actually
    read, rather than the total size of the file, allowing partial file
    uploads.
-   When uploading file-like objects, if they are empty or have no
    obvious content length we set `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` rather
    than `Content-Length: 0`.
-   We correctly receive the response in buffered mode when uploading
    chunked bodies.
-   We now handle being passed a query string as a bytestring on Python
    3, by decoding it as UTF-8.
-   Sessions are now closed in all cases (exceptional and not) when
    using the functional API rather than leaking and waiting for the
    garbage collector to clean them up.
-   Correctly handle digest auth headers with a malformed `qop`
    directive that contains no token, by treating it the same as if no
    `qop` directive was provided at all.
-   Minor performance improvements when removing specific cookies by
    name.

**Miscellaneous**

-   Updated urllib3 to 1.13.

2.8.1 (2015-10-13)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Update certificate bundle to match `certifi` 2015.9.6.2's weak
    certificate bundle.
-   Fix a bug in 2.8.0 where requests would raise `ConnectTimeout`
    instead of `ConnectionError`
-   When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
    respect the `json` parameter. Broken in 2.8.0.
-   When using the PreparedRequest flow, requests will now correctly
    handle a Unicode-string method name on Python 2. Broken in 2.8.0.

2.8.0 (2015-10-05)
------------------

**Minor Improvements** (Backwards Compatible)

-   Requests now supports per-host proxies. This allows the `proxies`
    dictionary to have entries of the form
    `{'<scheme>://<hostname>': '<proxy>'}`. Host-specific proxies will
    be used in preference to the previously-supported scheme-specific
    ones, but the previous syntax will continue to work.
-   `Response.raise_for_status` now prints the URL that failed as part
    of the exception message.
-   `requests.utils.get_netrc_auth` now takes an `raise_errors` kwarg,
    defaulting to `False`. When `True`, errors parsing `.netrc` files
    cause exceptions to be thrown.
-   Change to bundled projects import logic to make it easier to
    unbundle requests downstream.
-   Changed the default User-Agent string to avoid leaking data on
    Linux: now contains only the requests version.

**Bugfixes**

-   The `json` parameter to `post()` and friends will now only be used
    if neither `data` nor `files` are present, consistent with the
    documentation.
-   We now ignore empty fields in the `NO_PROXY` environment variable.
-   Fixed problem where `httplib.BadStatusLine` would get raised if
    combining `stream=True` with `contextlib.closing`.
-   Prevented bugs where we would attempt to return the same connection
    back to the connection pool twice when sending a Chunked body.
-   Miscellaneous minor internal changes.
-   Digest Auth support is now thread safe.

**Updates**

-   Updated urllib3 to 1.12.

2.7.0 (2015-05-03)
------------------

This is the first release that follows our new release process. For
more, see [our
documentation](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/community/release-process/).

**Bugfixes**

-   Updated urllib3 to 1.10.4, resolving several bugs involving chunked
    transfer encoding and response framing.

2.6.2 (2015-04-23)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Fix regression where compressed data that was sent as chunked data
    was not properly decompressed. (\#2561)

2.6.1 (2015-04-22)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Remove VendorAlias import machinery introduced in v2.5.2.
-   Simplify the PreparedRequest.prepare API: We no longer require the
    user to pass an empty list to the hooks keyword argument. (c.f.
    \#2552)
-   Resolve redirects now receives and forwards all of the original
    arguments to the adapter. (\#2503)
-   Handle UnicodeDecodeErrors when trying to deal with a unicode URL
    that cannot be encoded in ASCII. (\#2540)
-   Populate the parsed path of the URI field when performing Digest
    Authentication. (\#2426)
-   Copy a PreparedRequest's CookieJar more reliably when it is not an
    instance of RequestsCookieJar. (\#2527)

2.6.0 (2015-03-14)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   CVE-2015-2296: Fix handling of cookies on redirect. Previously a
    cookie without a host value set would use the hostname for the
    redirected URL exposing requests users to session fixation attacks
    and potentially cookie stealing. This was disclosed privately by
    Matthew Daley of [BugFuzz](https://bugfuzz.com). This affects all
    versions of requests from v2.1.0 to v2.5.3 (inclusive on both ends).
-   Fix error when requests is an `install_requires` dependency and
    `python setup.py test` is run. (\#2462)
-   Fix error when urllib3 is unbundled and requests continues to use
    the vendored import location.
-   Include fixes to `urllib3`'s header handling.
-   Requests' handling of unvendored dependencies is now more
    restrictive.

**Features and Improvements**

-   Support bytearrays when passed as parameters in the `files`
    argument. (\#2468)
-   Avoid data duplication when creating a request with `str`, `bytes`,
    or `bytearray` input to the `files` argument.

2.5.3 (2015-02-24)
------------------

**Bugfixes**

-   Revert changes to our vendored certificate bundle. For more context
    see (\#2455, \#2456, and <https://bugs.python.org/issue23476>)

2.5.2 (2015-02-23)
------------------

**Features and Improvements**

-   Add sha256 fingerprint support.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#540](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/540))
-   Improve the performance of headers.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#544](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/544))

**Bugfixes**

-   Copy pip's import machinery. When downstream redistributors remove
    requests.packages.urllib3 the import machinery will continue to let
    those same symbols work. Example usage in requests' documentation
    and 3rd-party libraries relying on the vendored copies of urllib3
    will work without having to fallback to the system urllib3.
-   Attempt to quote parts of the URL on redirect if unquoting and then
    quoting fails. (\#2356)
-   Fix filename type check for multipart form-data uploads. (\#2411)
-   Properly handle the case where a server issuing digest
    authentication challenges provides both auth and auth-int
    qop-values. (\#2408)
-   Fix a socket leak.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#549](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/549))
-   Fix multiple `Set-Cookie` headers properly.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#534](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/534))
-   Disable the built-in hostname verification.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#526](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/526))
-   Fix the behaviour of decoding an exhausted stream.
    ([shazow/urllib3\#535](https://github.com/shazow/urllib3/pull/535))

**Security**

-   Pulled in an updated `cacert.pem`.
-   Drop RC4 from the default cipher list.

    or not it actually did).
-   The `timeout` parameter now affects requests with both `stream=True`
    and `stream=False` equally.
-   The change in v2.0.0 to mandate explicit proxy schemes has been
    reverted. Proxy schemes now default to `http://`.
-   The `CaseInsensitiveDict` used for HTTP headers now behaves like a
    normal dictionary when references as string or viewed in the
    interpreter.

**Bugfixes**

-   No longer expose Authorization or Proxy-Authorization headers on
    redirect. Fix CVE-2014-1829 and CVE-2014-1830 respectively.
-   Authorization is re-evaluated each redirect.
-   On redirect, pass url as native strings.
-   Fall-back to autodetected encoding for JSON when Unicode detection

    or encoded '\#' character.
-   Assorted urllib3 fixes.

2.2.0 (2014-01-09)
------------------

**API Changes**

-   New exception: `ContentDecodingError`. Raised instead of `urllib3`
    `DecodeError` exceptions.

**Bugfixes**

-   Avoid many many exceptions from the buggy implementation of
    `proxy_bypass` on OS X in Python 2.6.
-   Avoid crashing when attempting to get authentication credentials
    from \~/.netrc when running as a user without a home directory.
-   Use the correct pool size for pools of connections to proxies.
-   Fix iteration of `CookieJar` objects.
-   Ensure that cookies are persisted over redirect.
-   Switch back to using chardet, since it has merged with charade.

2.1.0 (2013-12-05)
------------------

-   Updated CA Bundle, of course.
-   Cookies set on individual Requests through a `Session` (e.g. via
    `Session.get()`) are no longer persisted to the `Session`.
-   Clean up connections when we hit problems during chunked upload,
    rather than leaking them.
-   Return connections to the pool when a chunked upload is successful,
    rather than leaking it.
-   Match the HTTPbis recommendation for HTTP 301 redirects.

-   More resilient cookie handling.
-   Make `Response` objects pickleable.
-   Actually added MD5-sess to Digest Auth instead of pretending to like
    last time.
-   Updated internal urllib3.
-   Fixed @Lukasa's lack of taste.

2.0.1 (2013-10-24)
------------------

-   Updated included CA Bundle with new mistrusts and automated process
    for the future
-   Added MD5-sess to Digest Auth
-   Accept per-file headers in multipart file POST messages.
-   Fixed: Don't send the full URL on CONNECT messages.

-   Fixed: Translate urllib3 ProxyError into a requests ProxyError
    derived from ConnectionError.
-   Updated internal urllib3 and chardet.

2.0.0 (2013-09-24)
------------------

**API Changes:**

-   Keys in the Headers dictionary are now native strings on all Python
    versions, i.e. bytestrings on Python 2, unicode on Python 3.
-   Proxy URLs now *must* have an explicit scheme. A `MissingSchema`
    exception will be raised if they don't.
-   Timeouts now apply to read time if `Stream=False`.
-   `RequestException` is now a subclass of `IOError`, not
    `RuntimeError`.
-   Added new method to `PreparedRequest` objects:
    `PreparedRequest.copy()`.
-   Added new method to `Session` objects: `Session.update_request()`.
    This method updates a `Request` object with the data (e.g. cookies)
    stored on the `Session`.
-   Added new method to `Session` objects: `Session.prepare_request()`.
    This method updates and prepares a `Request` object, and returns the
    corresponding `PreparedRequest` object.
-   Added new method to `HTTPAdapter` objects:
    `HTTPAdapter.proxy_headers()`. This should not be called directly,
    but improves the subclass interface.
-   `httplib.IncompleteRead` exceptions caused by incorrect chunked
    encoding will now raise a Requests `ChunkedEncodingError` instead.
-   Invalid percent-escape sequences now cause a Requests `InvalidURL`
    exception to be raised.
-   HTTP 208 no longer uses reason phrase `"im_used"`. Correctly uses
    `"already_reported"`.
-   HTTP 226 reason added (`"im_used"`).

**Bugfixes:**

-   Vastly improved proxy support, including the CONNECT verb. Special
    thanks to the many contributors who worked towards this improvement.

    field.
-   `BytesIO` can be used to perform streaming uploads.
-   More generous parsing of the `no_proxy` environment variable.
-   Non-string objects can be passed in data values alongside files.

------------------

-   Fixed cookies on sessions and on requests
-   Significantly change how hooks are dispatched - hooks now receive
    all the arguments specified by the user when making a request so
    hooks can make a secondary request with the same parameters. This is
    especially necessary for authentication handler authors
-   certifi support was removed
-   Fixed bug where using OAuth 1 with body `signature_type` sent no
    data

# Requests

**Requests** is a simple, yet elegant, HTTP library.

```python
>>> import requests
>>> r = requests.get('https://httpbin.org/basic-auth/user/pass', auth=('user', 'pass'))
>>> r.status_code
200
>>> r.headers['content-type']
'application/json; charset=utf8'
>>> r.encoding
'utf-8'
>>> r.text
'{"authenticated": true, ...'
>>> r.json()
{'authenticated': True, ...}
```

Requests allows you to send HTTP/1.1 requests extremely easily. There’s no need to manually add query strings to your URLs, or to form-encode your `PUT` & `POST` data — but nowadays, just use the `json` method!

Requests is one of the most downloaded Python packages today, pulling in around `30M downloads / week`— according to GitHub, Requests is currently [depended upon](https://github.com/psf/requests/network/dependents?package_id=UGFja2FnZS01NzA4OTExNg%3D%3D) by `1,000,000+` repositories. You may certainly put your trust in this code.

## Cloning the repository

When cloning the Requests repository, you may need to add the `-c
fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore` flag to avoid an error about a bad commit (see
[this issue](https://github.com/psf/requests/issues/2690) for more background):

```shell
git clone -c fetch.fsck.badTimezone=ignore https://github.com/psf/requests.git
```

You can also apply this setting to your global Git config:

```shell
git config --global fetch.fsck.badTimezone ignore
```
