# History

## Origins

IPython was starting in 2001 by Fernando Perez while he was a graduate student at the University of Colorado, Boulder. IPython as we know it today grew out of the following three projects:

  - ipython by Fernando PÃ©rez. Fernando began using Python and ipython began as an outgrowth of his desire for things like Mathematica-style prompts, access to previous output (again like Mathematica's % syntax) and a flexible configuration system (something better than `PYTHONSTARTUP`).
  - IPP by Janko Hauser. Very well organized, great usability. Had an old help system. IPP was used as the "container" code into which Fernando added the functionality from ipython and LazyPython.
  - LazyPython by Nathan Gray. Simple but very powerful. The quick syntax (auto parens, auto quotes) and verbose/colored tracebacks were all taken from here.

Here is how Fernando describes the early history of IPython:

> When I found out about IPP and LazyPython I tried to join all three into a unified system. I thought this could provide a very nice working environment, both for regular programming and scientific computing: shell-like features, IDL/Matlab numerics, Mathematica-type prompt history and great object introspection and help facilities. I think it worked reasonably well, though it was a lot more work than I had initially planned.

         and Similar Rights in Your contributions to Adapted Material in
         accordance with the terms and conditions of this Public License.
    
      c. Copyright and Similar Rights means copyright and/or similar rights
         closely related to copyright including, without limitation,
         performance, broadcast, sound recording, and Sui Generis Database
         Rights, without regard to how the rights are labeled or
         categorized. For purposes of this Public License, the rights
         specified in Section 2(b)(1)-(2) are not Copyright and Similar
         Rights.
    
      d. Effective Technological Measures means those measures that, in the
         absence of proper authority, may not be circumvented under laws
         fulfilling obligations under Article 11 of the WIPO Copyright
         Treaty adopted on December 20, 1996, and/or similar international
         agreements.
    
      e. Exceptions and Limitations means fair use, fair dealing, and/or

         dissemination, communication, or importation, and to make material
         available to the public including in ways that members of the
         public may access the material from a place and at a time
         individually chosen by them.
    
      j. Sui Generis Database Rights means rights other than copyright
         resulting from Directive 96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of
         the Council of 11 March 1996 on the legal protection of databases,
         as amended and/or succeeded, as well as other essentially
         equivalent rights anywhere in the world.
    
      k. You means the individual or entity exercising the Licensed Rights
         under this Public License. Your has a corresponding meaning.

    Section 2 -- Scope.
    
      a. License grant.
    
           1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,
              the Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
              non-sublicensable, non-exclusive, irrevocable license to
              exercise the Licensed Rights in the Licensed Material to:
    
                a. reproduce and Share the Licensed Material, in whole or
                   in part; and
    
                b. produce, reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.
    
           2. Exceptions and Limitations. For the avoidance of doubt, where
              Exceptions and Limitations apply to Your use, this Public
              License does not apply, and You do not need to comply with
              its terms and conditions.
    
           3. Term. The term of this Public License is specified in Section
              6(a).
    
           4. Media and formats; technical modifications allowed. The
              Licensor authorizes You to exercise the Licensed Rights in
              all media and formats whether now known or hereafter created,
              and to make technical modifications necessary to do so. The
              Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert any right or
              authority to forbid You from making technical modifications
              necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including
              technical modifications necessary to circumvent Effective
              Technological Measures. For purposes of this Public License,
              simply making modifications authorized by this Section 2(a)
              (4) never produces Adapted Material.
    
           5. Downstream recipients.
    
                a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material. Every
                   recipient of the Licensed Material automatically
                   receives an offer from the Licensor to exercise the
                   Licensed Rights under the terms and conditions of this
                   Public License.
    
                b. No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose
                   any additional or different terms or conditions on, or
                   apply any Effective Technological Measures to, the
                   Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise of the
                   Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed
                   Material.
    
           6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or
              may be construed as permission to assert or imply that You
              are, or that Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected
              with, or sponsored, endorsed, or granted official status by,
              the Licensor or others designated to receive attribution as
              provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).
    
      b. Other rights.
    
           1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not
              licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,
              privacy, and/or other similar personality rights; however, to
              the extent possible, the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to
              assert any such rights held by the Licensor to the limited
              extent necessary to allow You to exercise the Licensed
              Rights, but not otherwise.
    
           2. Patent and trademark rights are not licensed under this
              Public License.
    
           3. To the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to
              collect royalties from You for the exercise of the Licensed
              Rights, whether directly or through a collecting society
              under any voluntary or waivable statutory or compulsory
              licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly
              reserves any right to collect such royalties.

    Section 3 -- License Conditions.
    
    Your exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject to the
    following conditions.
    
      a. Attribution.
    
           1. If You Share the Licensed Material (including in modified
              form), You must:
    
                a. retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor
                   with the Licensed Material:
    
                     i. identification of the creator(s) of the Licensed
                        Material and any others designated to receive
                        attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by
                        the Licensor (including by pseudonym if
                        designated);
    
                    ii. a copyright notice;
    
                   iii. a notice that refers to this Public License;
    
                    iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of
                        warranties;
    
                     v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the
                        extent reasonably practicable;
    
                b. indicate if You modified the Licensed Material and
                   retain an indication of any previous modifications; and
    
                c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this
                   Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or
                   hyperlink to, this Public License.
    
           2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section 3(a)(1) in any
              reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context in
              which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be
              reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or
              hyperlink to a resource that includes the required
              information.
    
           3. If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the
              information required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent
              reasonably practicable.
    
           4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's
              License You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted
              Material from complying with this Public License.

    Section 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.
    
    Where the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that
    apply to Your use of the Licensed Material:
    
      a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1) grants You the right
         to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial
         portion of the contents of the database;
    
      b. if You include all or a substantial portion of the database
         contents in a database in which You have Sui Generis Database
         Rights, then the database in which You have Sui Generis Database
         Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material; and
    
      c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share
         all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.
    
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not
    replace Your obligations under this Public License where the Licensed
    Rights include other Copyright and Similar Rights.

    Section 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.
    
      a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE
         EXTENT POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS
         AND AS-AVAILABLE, AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF
         ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,
         IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
         WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
         PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
         ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
         KNOWN OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT
         ALLOWED IN FULL OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
      b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE, IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE
         TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
         NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,
         INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,
         COSTS, EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR
         USE OF THE LICENSED MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN
         ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR
         DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR
         IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    
      c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
         above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent
         possible, most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and
         waiver of all liability.

    Section 6 -- Term and Termination.
    
      a. This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and
         Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with
         this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License
         terminate automatically.
    
      b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
         Section 6(a), it reinstates:
    
           1. automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided
              it is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the
              violation; or
    
           2. upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.
    
         For the avoidance of doubt, this Section 6(b) does not affect any
         right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your violations
         of this Public License.
    
      c. For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the
         Licensed Material under separate terms or conditions or stop
         distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so
         will not terminate this Public License.
    
      d. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public
         License.

    Section 7 -- Other Terms and Conditions.
    
      a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional or different
         terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.
    
      b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the
         Licensed Material not stated herein are separate from and
         independent of the terms and conditions of this Public License.

    Section 8 -- Interpretation.
    
      a. For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and
         shall not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose
         conditions on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully
         be made without permission under this Public License.
    
      b. To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
         deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
         minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
         cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
         without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
         conditions.
    
      c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no
         failure to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the
         Licensor.
    
      d. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted
         as a limitation upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities
         that apply to the Licensor or You, including from the legal
         processes of any jurisdiction or authority.

## About the IPython Development Team

Fernando Perez began IPython in 2001 based on code from Janko Hauser \<jhauser-AT-zscout.de\> and Nathaniel Gray \<n8gray-AT-caltech.edu\>. Fernando is still the project lead.

The IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project. This includes all of the IPython subprojects. See the release notes for a list of people who have contributed to each release.

## Our Copyright Policy

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes (diffs/commits) to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.

Any new code contributed to IPython must be licensed under the BSD license or a similar (MIT) open source license.

## Miscellaneous

Some files (DPyGetOpt.py, for example) may be licensed under different conditions. Ultimately each file indicates clearly the conditions under which its author/authors have decided to publish the code.

Versions of IPython up to and including 0.6.3 were released under the GNU Lesser General Public License (LGPL), available at <http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html>.

# IPython Events<span id="events"></span>

Extension code can register callbacks functions which will be called on specific events within the IPython code. You can see the current list of available callbacks, and the parameters that will be passed with each, in the callback prototype functions defined in `IPython.core.events`.

To register callbacks, use <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.events.EventManager.register</span>. For example:

    class VarWatcher(object):
        def __init__(self, ip):
            self.shell = ip
            self.last_x = None
    
        def pre_execute(self):
            self.last_x = self.shell.user_ns.get('x', None)
    
        def pre_run_cell(self, info):
            print('info.raw_cell =', info.raw_cell)
            print('info.store_history =', info.store_history)
            print('info.silent =', info.silent)
            print('info.shell_futures =', info.shell_futures)
            print('info.cell_id =', info.cell_id)
            print(dir(info))
    
        def post_execute(self):
            if self.shell.user_ns.get('x', None) != self.last_x:
                print("x changed!")
    
        def post_run_cell(self, result):
            print('result.execution_count = ', result.execution_count)
            print('result.error_before_exec = ', result.error_before_exec)
            print('result.error_in_exec = ', result.error_in_exec)
            print('result.info = ', result.info)
            print('result.result = ', result.result)
    
    def load_ipython_extension(ip):
        vw = VarWatcher(ip)
        ip.events.register('pre_execute', vw.pre_execute)
        ip.events.register('pre_run_cell', vw.pre_run_cell)
        ip.events.register('post_execute', vw.post_execute)
        ip.events.register('post_run_cell', vw.post_run_cell)

<div class="versionadded">

8.3

Since IPython 8.3 and ipykernel 6.12.1, the `info` objects in the callback now have a the `cell_id` that will be set to the value sent by the frontened, when those send it.

</div>

## Events

These are the events IPython will emit. Callbacks will be passed no arguments, unless otherwise specified.

### shell\_initialized

`` `python     def shell_initialized(ipython):         ...  This event is triggered only once, at the end of setting up IPython. ``\` Extensions registered to load by default as part of configuration can use this to execute code to finalize setup. Callbacks will be passed the InteractiveShell instance.

### pre\_run\_cell

`pre_run_cell` fires prior to interactive execution (e.g. a cell in a notebook). It can be used to note the state prior to execution, and keep track of changes. An object containing information used for the code execution is provided as an argument.

### pre\_execute

`pre_execute` is like `pre_run_cell`, but is triggered prior to *any* execution. Sometimes code can be executed by libraries, etc. which skipping the history/display mechanisms, in which cases `pre_run_cell` will not fire.

### post\_run\_cell

`post_run_cell` runs after interactive execution (e.g. a cell in a notebook). It can be used to cleanup or notify or perform operations on any side effects produced during execution. For instance, the inline matplotlib backend uses this event to display any figures created but not explicitly displayed during the course of the cell. The object which will be returned as the execution result is provided as an argument.

### post\_execute

The same as `pre_execute`, `post_execute` is like `post_run_cell`, but fires for *all* executions, not just interactive ones.

# Defining custom magics

There are two main ways to define your own magic functions: from standalone functions and by inheriting from a base class provided by IPython: <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.magic.Magics</span>. Below we show code you can place in a file that you load from your configuration, such as any file in the `startup` subdirectory of your default IPython profile.

First, let us see the simplest case. The following shows how to create a line magic, a cell one and one that works in both modes, using just plain functions:

``` python
from IPython.core.magic import (register_line_magic, register_cell_magic,
                                register_line_cell_magic)

@register_line_magic
def lmagic(line):
    "my line magic"
    return line

@register_cell_magic
def cmagic(line, cell):
    "my cell magic"
    return line, cell

@register_line_cell_magic
def lcmagic(line, cell=None):
    "Magic that works both as %lcmagic and as %%lcmagic"
    if cell is None:
        print("Called as line magic")
        return line
    else:
        print("Called as cell magic")
        return line, cell

# In an interactive session, we need to delete these to avoid
# name conflicts for automagic to work on line magics.
del lmagic, lcmagic
```

You can also create magics of all three kinds by inheriting from the <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.magic.Magics</span> class. This lets you create magics that can potentially hold state in between calls, and that have full access to the main IPython object:

``` python
# This code can be put in any Python module, it does not require IPython
# itself to be running already.  It only creates the magics subclass but
# doesn't instantiate it yet.
from __future__ import print_function
from IPython.core.magic import (Magics, magics_class, line_magic,
                                cell_magic, line_cell_magic)

# The class MUST call this class decorator at creation time
@magics_class
class MyMagics(Magics):

    @line_magic
    def lmagic(self, line):
        "my line magic"
        print("Full access to the main IPython object:", self.shell)
        print("Variables in the user namespace:", list(self.shell.user_ns.keys()))
        return line

    @cell_magic
    def cmagic(self, line, cell):
        "my cell magic"
        return line, cell

    @line_cell_magic
    def lcmagic(self, line, cell=None):
        "Magic that works both as %lcmagic and as %%lcmagic"
        if cell is None:
            print("Called as line magic")
            return line
        else:
            print("Called as cell magic")
            return line, cell

# In order to actually use these magics, you must register them with a
# running IPython.

def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
    """
    Any module file that define a function named `load_ipython_extension`
    can be loaded via `%load_ext module.path` or be configured to be
    autoloaded by IPython at startup time.
    """
    # You can register the class itself without instantiating it.  IPython will
    # call the default constructor on it.
    ipython.register_magics(MyMagics)
```

If you want to create a class with a different constructor that holds additional state, then you should always call the parent constructor and instantiate the class yourself before registration:

``` python
@magics_class
class StatefulMagics(Magics):
    "Magics that hold additional state"

    def __init__(self, shell, data):
        # You must call the parent constructor
        super(StatefulMagics, self).__init__(shell)
        self.data = data

    # etc...

def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
    """
    Any module file that define a function named `load_ipython_extension`
    can be loaded via `%load_ext module.path` or be configured to be
    autoloaded by IPython at startup time.
    """
    # This class must then be registered with a manually created instance,
    # since its constructor has different arguments from the default:
    magics = StatefulMagics(ipython, some_data)
    ipython.register_magics(magics)
```

\> **Note** \> In early IPython versions 0.12 and before the line magics were created using a <span class="title-ref">define\_magic</span> API function. This API has been replaced with the above in IPython 0.13 and then completely removed in IPython 5. Maintainers of IPython extensions that still use the <span class="title-ref">define\_magic</span> function are advised to adjust their code for the current API.

# Accessing user namespace and local scope

When creating line magics, you may need to access surrounding scope to get user variables (e.g when called inside functions). IPython provides the `@needs_local_scope` decorator that can be imported from `IPython.core.magic`. When decorated with `@needs_local_scope` a magic will be passed `local_ns` as an argument. As a convenience `@needs_local_scope` can also be applied to cell magics even if cell magics cannot appear at local scope context.

# Silencing the magic output

Sometimes it may be useful to define a magic that can be silenced the same way that non-magic expressions can, i.e., by appending a semicolon at the end of the Python code to be executed. That can be achieved by decorating the magic function with the decorator `@output_can_be_silenced` that can be imported from `IPython.core.magic`. When this decorator is used, IPython will parse the Python code used by the magic and, if the last token is a `;`, the output created by the magic will not show up on the screen. If you want to see an example of this decorator in action, take a look on the `time` magic defined in `IPython.core.magics.execution.py`.

# Complete Example

Here is a full example of a magic package. You can distribute magics using setuptools, distutils, or any other distribution tools like [flit](https://flit.readthedocs.io) for pure Python packages.

When distributing magics as part of a package, recommended best practice is to execute the registration inside the <span class="title-ref">load\_ipython\_extension</span> as demonstrated in the example below, instead of directly in the module (as in the initial example with the `@register_*` decorators). This means a user will need to explicitly choose to load your magic with `%load_ext`. instead implicitly getting it when importing the module. This is particularly relevant if loading your magic has side effects, if it is slow to load, or if it might override another magic with the same name.

``` bash
.
âââ example_magic
âÂ Â  âââ __init__.py
âÂ Â  âââ abracadabra.py
âââ setup.py
```

``` bash
$ cat example_magic/__init__.py
"""An example magic"""
__version__ = '0.0.1'

from .abracadabra import Abracadabra

def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
    ipython.register_magics(Abracadabra)
```

``` bash
$ cat example_magic/abracadabra.py
from IPython.core.magic import (Magics, magics_class, line_magic, cell_magic)

@magics_class
class Abracadabra(Magics):

    @line_magic
    def abra(self, line):
        return line

    @cell_magic
    def cadabra(self, line, cell):
        return line, cell
```

# Specific config details

## Custom Prompts

<div class="versionchanged">

5.0

</div>

From IPython 5, prompts are produced as a list of Pygments tokens, which are tuples of (token\_type, text). You can customise prompts by writing a method which generates a list of tokens.

There are four kinds of prompt:

  - The **in** prompt is shown before the first line of input (default like `In [1]:`).
  - The **continuation** prompt is shown before further lines of input (default like `...:`).
  - The **rewrite** prompt is shown to highlight how special syntax has been interpreted (default like `----->`).
  - The **out** prompt is shown before the result from evaluating the input (default like `Out[1]:`).

Custom prompts are supplied together as a class. If you want to customise only some of the prompts, inherit from <span class="title-ref">IPython.terminal.prompts.Prompts</span>, which defines the defaults. The required interface is like this:

<div class="MyPrompts(shell)">

Prompt style definition. *shell* is a reference to the <span class="title-ref">\~.TerminalInteractiveShell</span> instance.

<div class="method">

in\_prompt\_tokens() continuation\_prompt\_tokens(self, width=None) rewrite\_prompt\_tokens() out\_prompt\_tokens()

Return the respective prompts as lists of `(token_type, text)` tuples.

For continuation prompts, *width* is an integer representing the width of the prompt area in terminal columns.

</div>

</div>

Here is an example Prompt class that will show the current working directory in the input prompt:

`` `python     from IPython.terminal.prompts import Prompts, Token     import os      class MyPrompt(Prompts):          def in_prompt_tokens(self):              return [(Token, os.getcwd()),                      (Token.Prompt, ' >>>')]  To set the new prompt, assign it to the ``prompts`attribute of the IPython`\` shell:

`` `python     In [2]: ip = get_ipython()        ...: ip.prompts = MyPrompt(ip)      /home/bob >>> # it works  See ``IPython/example/utils/cwd\_prompt.py`for an example of how to write`\` extensions to customise prompts.

Inside IPython or in a startup script, you can use a custom prompts class by setting `get_ipython().prompts` to an *instance* of the class. In configuration, `TerminalInteractiveShell.prompts_class` may be set to either the class object, or a string of its full importable name.

To include invisible terminal control sequences in a prompt, use `Token.ZeroWidthEscape` as the token type. Tokens with this type are ignored when calculating the width.

Colours in the prompt are determined by the token types and the highlighting style; see below for more details. The tokens used in the default prompts are `Prompt`, `PromptNum`, `OutPrompt` and `OutPromptNum`.

## Terminal Colors

<div class="versionchanged">

5.0

</div>

There are two main configuration options controlling colours.

`InteractiveShell.colors` sets the colour of tracebacks and object info (the output from e.g. `zip?`). It may also affect other things if the option below is set to `'legacy'`. It has four case-insensitive values: `'nocolor', 'neutral', 'linux', 'lightbg'`. The default is *neutral*, which should be legible on either dark or light terminal backgrounds. *linux* is optimised for dark backgrounds and *lightbg* for light ones.

`TerminalInteractiveShell.highlighting_style` determines prompt colours and syntax highlighting. It takes the name (as a string) or class (as a subclass of `pygments.style.Style`) of a Pygments style, or the special value `'legacy'` to pick a style in accordance with `InteractiveShell.colors`.

You can see the Pygments styles available on your system by running:

    from pygments.styles import get_all_styles
    list(get_all_styles())

Additionally, `TerminalInteractiveShell.highlighting_style_overrides` can override specific styles in the highlighting. It should be a dictionary mapping Pygments token types to strings defining the style. See [Pygments' documentation](http://pygments.org/docs/styles/#creating-own-styles) for the language used to define styles.

### Colors in the pager

On some systems, the default pager has problems with ANSI colour codes. To configure your default pager to allow these:

1.  Set the environment PAGER variable to `less`.
2.  Set the environment LESS variable to `-r` (plus any other options you always want to pass to less by default). This tells less to properly interpret control sequences, which is how color information is given to your terminal.

## Editor configuration

IPython can integrate with text editors in a number of different ways:

  - Editors (such as [(X)Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/), [vim](#vim) and [TextMate]()) can send code to IPython for execution.
  - IPython's `%edit` magic command can open an editor of choice to edit a code block.

The %edit command (and its alias %ed) will invoke the editor set in your environment as `EDITOR`. If this variable is not set, it will default to vi under Linux/Unix and to notepad under Windows. You may want to set this variable properly and to a lightweight editor which doesn't take too long to start (that is, something other than a new instance of Emacs). This way you can edit multi-line code quickly and with the power of a real editor right inside IPython.

You can also control the editor by setting <span class="title-ref">TerminalInteractiveShell.editor</span> in `ipython_config.py`.

### Vim

Paul Ivanov's [vim-ipython](https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython) provides powerful IPython integration for vim.

### (X)Emacs

If you are a dedicated Emacs user, and want to use Emacs when IPython's `%edit` magic command is called you should set up the Emacs server so that new requests are handled by the original process. This means that almost no time is spent in handling the request (assuming an Emacs process is already running). For this to work, you need to set your EDITOR environment variable to 'emacsclient'. The code below, supplied by Francois Pinard, can then be used in your `.emacs` file to enable the server:

`` `common-lisp     (defvar server-buffer-clients)     (when (and (fboundp 'server-start) (string-equal (getenv "TERM") 'xterm))       (server-start)       (defun fp-kill-server-with-buffer-routine ()         (and server-buffer-clients (server-done)))       (add-hook 'kill-buffer-hook 'fp-kill-server-with-buffer-routine))  Thanks to the work of Alexander Schmolck and Prabhu Ramachandran, ``\` currently (X)Emacs and IPython get along very well in other ways.

With (X)EMacs \>= 24, You can enable IPython in python-mode with:

`` `common-lisp     (require 'python)     (setq python-shell-interpreter "ipython") ``\` .. \_TextMate: <http://macromates.com/> .. \_vim: <http://www.vim.org/>

## Keyboard Shortcuts

<div class="versionadded">

8.11

</div>

You can modify, disable or modify keyboard shortcuts for IPython Terminal using :std`TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts` traitlet.

The list of shortcuts is available in the Configuring IPython \[terminal-shortcuts-list\](\#terminal-shortcuts-list) section.

### Advanced configuration

<div class="versionchanged">

5.0

</div>

Creating custom commands requires adding custom code to a \[startup file \<startup\_files\>\](\#startup-file-\<startup\_files\>):

    from IPython import get_ipython
    from prompt_toolkit.enums import DEFAULT_BUFFER
    from prompt_toolkit.keys import Keys
    from prompt_toolkit.filters import HasFocus, HasSelection, ViInsertMode, EmacsInsertMode
    
    ip = get_ipython()
    insert_mode = ViInsertMode() | EmacsInsertMode()
    
    def insert_unexpected(event):
        buf = event.current_buffer
        buf.insert_text('The Spanish Inquisition')
    # Register the shortcut if IPython is using prompt_toolkit
    if getattr(ip, 'pt_app', None):
        registry = ip.pt_app.key_bindings
        registry.add_binding(Keys.ControlN,
                         filter=(HasFocus(DEFAULT_BUFFER)
                                 & ~HasSelection()
                                 & insert_mode))(insert_unexpected)

Here is a second example that bind the key sequence `j`, `k` to switch to VI input mode to `Normal` when in insert mode:

    from IPython import get_ipython
    from prompt_toolkit.enums import DEFAULT_BUFFER
    from prompt_toolkit.filters import HasFocus, ViInsertMode
    from prompt_toolkit.key_binding.vi_state import InputMode
    
    ip = get_ipython()
    
    def switch_to_navigation_mode(event):
       vi_state = event.cli.vi_state
       vi_state.input_mode = InputMode.NAVIGATION
    
    if getattr(ip, 'pt_app', None):
       registry = ip.pt_app.key_bindings
       registry.add_binding(u'j',u'k',
                            filter=(HasFocus(DEFAULT_BUFFER)
                                     & ViInsertMode()))(switch_to_navigation_mode)

For more information on filters and what you can do with the `event` object, [see the prompt\_toolkit docs](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/pages/asking_for_input.html#adding-custom-key-bindings).

### Enter to execute

In the Terminal IPython shell âÂ which by default uses the `prompt_toolkit` interface, the semantic meaning of pressing the `Enter` key can be ambiguous. In some case `Enter` should execute code, and in others it should add a new line. IPython uses heuristics to decide whether to execute or insert a new line at cursor position. For example, if we detect that the current code is not valid Python, then the user is likely editing code and the right behavior is to likely to insert a new line. If the current code is a simple statement like <span class="title-ref">ord('\*')</span>, then the right behavior is likely to execute. Though the exact desired semantics often varies from users to users.

As the exact behavior of `Enter` is ambiguous, it has been special cased to allow users to completely configure the behavior they like. Hence you can have enter always execute code. If you prefer fancier behavior, you need to get your hands dirty and read the `prompt_toolkit` and IPython documentation though. See `10500`, set the `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.handle_return` option and get inspiration from the following example that only auto-executes the input if it begins with a bang or a modulo character (`!` or `%`). To use the following code, add it to your IPython configuration:

    def custom_return(shell):
    
        """This function is required by the API. It takes a reference to
        the shell, which is the same thing `get_ipython()` evaluates to.
        This function must return a function that handles each keypress
        event. That function, named `handle` here, references `shell`
        by closure."""
    
        def handle(event):
    
            """This function is called each time `Enter` is pressed,
            and takes a reference to a Prompt Toolkit event object.
            If the current input starts with a bang or modulo, then
            the input is executed, otherwise a newline is entered,
            followed by any spaces needed to auto-indent."""
    
            # set up a few handy references to nested items...
    
            buffer = event.current_buffer
            document = buffer.document
            text = document.text
    
            if text.startswith('!') or text.startswith('%'): # execute the input...
    
                buffer.accept_action.validate_and_handle(event.cli, buffer)
    
            else: # insert a newline with auto-indentation...
    
                if document.line_count > 1: text = text[:document.cursor_position]
                indent = shell.check_complete(text)[1]
                buffer.insert_text('\n' + indent)
    
                # if you just wanted a plain newline without any indentation, you
                # could use `buffer.insert_text('\n')` instead of the lines above
    
        return handle
    
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.handle_return = custom_return

# Integrating with GUI event loops

When the user types `%gui qt`, IPython integrates itself with the Qt event loop, so you can use both a GUI and an interactive prompt together. IPython supports a number of common GUI toolkits, but from IPython 3.0, it is possible to integrate other event loops without modifying IPython itself.

Supported event loops include `qt5`, `qt6`, `gtk2`, `gtk3`, `gtk4`, `wx`, `osx` and `tk`. Make sure the event loop you specify matches the GUI toolkit used by your own code.

To make IPython GUI event loop integration occur automatically at every startup, set the `c.InteractiveShellApp.gui` configuration key in your IPython profile (see \[setting\_config\](\#setting\_config)).

If the event loop you use is supported by IPython, turning on event loop integration follows the steps just described whether you use Terminal IPython or an IPython kernel.

However, the way Terminal IPython handles event loops is very different from the way IPython kernel does, so if you need to integrate with a new kind of event loop, different steps are needed to integrate with each.

## Integrating with a new event loop in the terminal

<div class="versionchanged">

5.0

There is a new API for event loop integration using prompt\_toolkit.

</div>

In the terminal, IPython uses prompt\_toolkit to prompt the user for input. prompt\_toolkit provides hooks to integrate with an external event loop.

To integrate an event loop, define a function which runs the GUI event loop until there is input waiting for prompt\_toolkit to process. There are two ways to detect this condition:

    # Polling for input.
    def inputhook(context):
        while not context.input_is_ready():
            # Replace this with the appropriate call for the event loop:
            iterate_loop_once()
    
    # Using a file descriptor to notify the event loop to stop.
    def inputhook2(context):
        fd = context.fileno()
        # Replace the functions below with those for the event loop.
        add_file_reader(fd, callback=stop_the_loop)
        run_the_loop()

Once you have defined this function, register it with IPython:

<div class="currentmodule">

IPython.terminal.pt\_inputhooks

</div>

<div class="function">

register(name, inputhook)

Register the function *inputhook* as the event loop integration for the GUI *name*. If `name='foo'`, then the user can enable this integration by running `%gui foo`.

</div>

## Integrating with a new event loop in the kernel

The kernel runs its own event loop, so it's simpler to integrate with others. IPython allows the other event loop to take control, but it must call <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.zmq.kernelbase.Kernel.do\_one\_iteration</span> periodically.

To integrate with this, write a function that takes a single argument, the IPython kernel instance, arranges for your event loop to call `kernel.do_one_iteration()` at least every `kernel._poll_interval` seconds, and starts the event loop.

Decorate this function with <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.zmq.eventloops.register\_integration</span>, passing in the names you wish to register it for. Here is a slightly simplified version of the Tkinter integration already included in IPython:

    @register_integration('tk')
    def loop_tk(kernel):
        """Start a kernel with the Tk event loop."""
        from tkinter import Tk
    
        # Tk uses milliseconds
        poll_interval = int(1000*kernel._poll_interval)
        # For Tkinter, we create a Tk object and call its withdraw method.
        class Timer(object):
            def __init__(self, func):
                self.app = Tk()
                self.app.withdraw()
                self.func = func
    
            def on_timer(self):
                self.func()
                self.app.after(poll_interval, self.on_timer)
    
            def start(self):
                self.on_timer()  # Call it once to get things going.
                self.app.mainloop()
    
        kernel.timer = Timer(kernel.do_one_iteration)
        kernel.timer.start()

Some event loops can go one better, and integrate checking for messages on the kernel's ZMQ sockets, making the kernel more responsive than plain polling. How to do this is outside the scope of this document; if you are interested, look at the integration with Qt in `IPython.kernel.zmq.eventloops`.

# IPython extensions

A level above configuration are IPython extensions, Python modules which modify the behaviour of the shell. They are referred to by an importable module name, and can be placed anywhere you'd normally import from.

## Getting extensions

A few important extensions are \[bundled with IPython \<bundled\_extensions\>\](\#bundled-with-ipython-\<bundled\_extensions\>). Others can be found on the [extensions index](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Extensions-Index) on the wiki, and the [Framework :: IPython tag](https://pypi.python.org/pypi?:action=browse&c=586) on PyPI.

Extensions on PyPI can be installed using `pip`, like any other Python package.

## Using extensions

To load an extension while IPython is running, use the `%load_ext` magic:

``` ipython
In [1]: %load_ext myextension
```

To load it each time IPython starts, list it in your configuration file:

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [
        'myextension'
    ]

## Writing extensions

An IPython extension is an importable Python module that has a couple of special functions to load and unload it. Here is a template:

    # myextension.py
    
    def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
        # The `ipython` argument is the currently active `InteractiveShell`
        # instance, which can be used in any way. This allows you to register

This <span class="title-ref">load\_ipython\_extension</span> function is called after your extension is imported, and the currently active <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> instance is passed as the only argument. You can do anything you want with IPython at that point.

<span class="title-ref">load\_ipython\_extension</span> will not be called again if the users use <span class="title-ref">%load\_extension</span>. The user has to explicitly ask the extension to be reloaded (with <span class="title-ref">%reload\_extension</span>). In cases where the user asks the extension to be reloaded, the extension will be unloaded (with <span class="title-ref">unload\_ipython\_extension</span>), and loaded again.

Useful <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShell</span> methods include <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.register\_magic\_function</span>, <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.push</span> (to add variables to the user namespace) and <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.drop\_by\_id</span> (to remove variables on unloading).

You can put your extension modules anywhere you want, as long as they can be imported by Python's standard import mechanism.

When your extension is ready for general use, please add it to the [extensions index](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Extensions-Index). We also encourage you to upload it to PyPI and use the `Framework :: IPython` classifier, so that users can install it with standard packaging tools.

# Custom input transformation

IPython extends Python syntax to allow things like magic commands, and help with the `?` syntax. There are several ways to customise how the user's input is processed into Python code to be executed.

These hooks are mainly for other projects using IPython as the core of their interactive interface. Using them carelessly can easily break IPython\!

## String based transformations

<div class="currentmodule">

IPython.core.inputtransforms

</div>

When the user enters code, it is first processed as a string. By the end of this stage, it must be valid Python syntax.

<div class="versionchanged">

7.0

The API for string and token-based transformations has been completely redesigned. Any third party code extending input transformation will need to be rewritten. The new API is, hopefully, simpler.

</div>

String based transformations are functions which accept a list of strings: each string is a single line of the input cell, including its line ending. The transformation function should return output in the same structure.

These transformations are in two groups, accessible as attributes of the <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> instance. Each group is a list of transformation functions.

  - `input_transformers_cleanup` run first on input, to do things like stripping prompts and leading indents from copied code. It may not be possible at this stage to parse the input as valid Python code.
  - Then IPython runs its own transformations to handle its special syntax, like `%magics` and `!system` commands. This part does not expose extension points.
  - `input_transformers_post` run as the last step, to do things like converting float literals into decimal objects. These may attempt to parse the input as Python code.

These transformers may raise <span class="title-ref">SyntaxError</span> if the input code is invalid, but in most cases it is clearer to pass unrecognised code through unmodified and let Python's own parser decide whether it is valid.

For example, imagine we want to obfuscate our code by reversing each line, so we'd write `)5(f =+ a` instead of `a += f(5)`. Here's how we could swap it back the right way before IPython tries to run it:

    def reverse_line_chars(lines):
        new_lines = []
        for line in lines:
            chars = line[:-1]  # the newline needs to stay at the end
            new_lines.append(chars[::-1] + '\n')
        return new_lines

To start using this:

    ip = get_ipython()
    ip.input_transformers_cleanup.append(reverse_line_chars)

<div class="versionadded">

7.17

input\_transformers can now have an attribute `has_side_effects` set to <span class="title-ref">True</span>, which will prevent the transformers from being ran when IPython is trying to guess whether the user input is complete.

</div>

## AST transformations

After the code has been parsed as Python syntax, you can use Python's powerful *Abstract Syntax Tree* tools to modify it. Subclass <span class="title-ref">ast.NodeTransformer</span>, and add an instance to `shell.ast_transformers`.

This example wraps integer literals in an `Integer` class, which is useful for mathematical frameworks that want to handle e.g. `1/3` as a precise fraction:

    class IntegerWrapper(ast.NodeTransformer):
        """Wraps all integers in a call to Integer()"""
        def visit_Num(self, node):
            if isinstance(node.value, int):
                return ast.Call(func=ast.Name(id='Integer', ctx=ast.Load()),
                                args=[node], keywords=[])
            return node

# Integrating your objects with IPython

## Tab completion

To change the attributes displayed by tab-completing your object, define a `__dir__(self)` method for it. For more details, see the documentation of the built-in :external+python:py\`dir\`

You can also customise key completions for your objects, e.g. pressing tab after `obj["a`. To do so, define a method `_ipython_key_completions_()`, which returns a list of objects which are possible keys in a subscript expression `obj[key]`.

<div class="versionadded">

5.0 Custom key completions

</div>

## Rich display

### Custom methods

IPython can display richer representations of objects. To do this, you can define `_ipython_display_()`, or any of a number of `_repr_*_()` methods. Note that these are surrounded by single, not double underscores.

| Format              | REPL | Notebook | Qt Console |
| ------------------- | ---- | -------- | ---------- |
| `_repr_pretty_`     | yes  | yes      | yes        |
| `_repr_svg_`        | no   | yes      | yes        |
| `_repr_png_`        | no   | yes      | yes        |
| `_repr_jpeg_`       | no   | yes      | yes        |
| `_repr_html_`       | no   | yes      | no         |
| `_repr_javascript_` | no   | yes      | no         |
| `_repr_markdown_`   | no   | yes      | no         |
| `_repr_latex_`      | no   | yes      | no         |
| `_repr_mimebundle_` | no   | ?        | ?          |

Supported `_repr_*_` methods

If the methods don't exist, the standard `repr()` is used. If a method exists and returns `None`, it is treated the same as if it does not exist. In general, *all* available formatters will be called when an object is displayed, and it is up to the UI to select which to display. A given formatter should not generally change its output based on what other formats are available -that should be handled at a different level, such as the <span class="title-ref">\~.DisplayFormatter</span>, or configuration.

`_repr_*_` methods should *return* data of the expected format and have no side effects. For example, `_repr_html_` should return HTML as a <span class="title-ref">str</span> and `_repr_png_` should return PNG data as <span class="title-ref">bytes</span>.

If you wish to take control of display via your own side effects, use `_ipython_display_()`.

For example:

    class Shout(object):
        def __init__(self, text):
            self.text = text
    
        def _repr_html_(self):
            return "<h1>" + self.text + "</h1>"

#### Special methods

##### Pretty printing

To customize how your object is pretty-printed, add a `_repr_pretty_` method to the class. The method should accept a pretty printer, and a boolean that indicates whether the printer detected a cycle. The method should act on the printer to produce your customized pretty output. Here is an example:

    class MyObject(object):
    
        def _repr_pretty_(self, p, cycle):
            if cycle:
                p.text('MyObject(...)')
            else:
                p.text('MyObject[...]')

For details on how to use the pretty printer, see :py`IPython.lib.pretty`.

##### More powerful methods

<div class="MyObject">

<div class="method">

\_[repr\_mimebundle]()(include=None, exclude=None)

Should return a dictionary of multiple formats, keyed by mimetype, or a tuple of two dictionaries: *data, metadata* (see \[Metadata\](\#metadata)). If this returns something, other `_repr_*_` methods are ignored. The method should take keyword arguments `include` and `exclude`, though it is not required to respect them.

</div>

<div class="method">

\_[ipython\_display]()()

Displays the object as a side effect; the return value is ignored. If this is defined, all other display methods are ignored.

</div>

</div>

#### Metadata

We often want to provide frontends with guidance on how to display the data. To support this, `_repr_*_()` methods (except `_repr_pretty_`?) can also return a `(data, metadata)` tuple where `metadata` is a dictionary containing arbitrary key-value pairs for the frontend to interpret. An example use case is `_repr_jpeg_()`, which can be set to return a jpeg image and a `{'height': 400, 'width': 600}` dictionary to inform the frontend how to size the image.

### Formatters for third-party types

The user can also register formatters for types without modifying the class:

    from bar.baz import Foo
    
    def foo_html(obj):
        return '<marquee>Foo object %s</marquee>' % obj.name
    
    html_formatter = get_ipython().display_formatter.formatters['text/html']
    html_formatter.for_type(Foo, foo_html)
    
    # Or register a type without importing it - this does the same as above:
    html_formatter.for_type_by_name('bar.baz', 'Foo', foo_html)

## Custom exception tracebacks

Rarely, you might want to display a custom traceback when reporting an exception. To do this, define the custom traceback using <span class="title-ref">\_render\_traceback\_(self)</span> method which returns a list of strings, one string for each line of the traceback. For example, the [ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/) a parallel computing framework for IPython, does this to display errors from multiple engines.

Please be conservative in using this feature; by replacing the default traceback you may hide important information from the user.

# Introduction to IPython configuration

## Setting configurable options

Many of IPython's classes have configurable attributes (see \[options/index\](options/index.md) for the list). These can be configured in several ways.

### Python configuration files

To create the blank configuration files, run:

    ipython profile create [profilename]

If you leave out the profile name, the files will be created for the `default` profile (see \[profiles\](\#profiles)). These will typically be located in `~/.ipython/profile_default/`, and will be named `ipython_config.py`, for historical reasons you may also find files named with IPython prefix instead of Jupyter: `ipython_notebook_config.py`, etc. The settings in `ipython_config.py` apply to all IPython commands.

By default, configuration files are fully featured Python scripts that can execute arbitrary code, the main usage is to set value on the configuration object `c` which exist in your configuration file.

You can then configure class attributes like this:

    c.InteractiveShell.automagic = False

Be careful with spelling--incorrect names will simply be ignored, with no error.

To add to a collection which may have already been defined elsewhere or have default values, you can use methods like those found on lists, dicts and sets: append, extend, <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.LazyConfigValue.prepend</span> (like extend, but at the front), add and update (which works both for dicts and sets):

    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions.append('Cython')

<div class="versionadded">

2.0 list, dict and set methods for config values

</div>

#### Example configuration file

    # sample ipython_config.py
    
    c.TerminalIPythonApp.display_banner = True
    c.InteractiveShellApp.log_level = 20
    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [
        'myextension'
    ]
    c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_lines = [
        'import numpy',
        'import scipy'
    ]
    c.InteractiveShellApp.exec_files = [
        'mycode.py',
        'fancy.ipy'
    ]
    c.InteractiveShell.colors = 'LightBG'
    c.InteractiveShell.xmode = 'Context'
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.confirm_exit = False
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor = 'nano'
    
    c.PrefilterManager.multi_line_specials = True
    
    c.AliasManager.user_aliases = [
     ('la', 'ls -al')
    ]

### JSON Configuration files

In case where executability of configuration can be problematic, or configurations need to be modified programmatically, IPython also support a limited set of functionalities via `.json` configuration files.

You can define most of the configuration options via a JSON object whose hierarchy represents the value you would normally set on the `c` object of `.py` configuration files. The following `ipython_config.json` file:

    {
        "InteractiveShell": {
            "colors": "LightBG",
        },
        "InteractiveShellApp": {
            "extensions": [
                "myextension"
            ]
        },
        "TerminalInteractiveShell": {
            "editor": "nano"
        }
    }

Is equivalent to the following `ipython_config.py`:

    c.InteractiveShell.colors = 'LightBG'
    c.InteractiveShellApp.extensions = [
        'myextension'
    ]
    c.TerminalInteractiveShell.editor = 'nano'

### Command line arguments

Every configurable value can be set from the command line, using this syntax:

    ipython --ClassName.attribute=value

Many frequently used options have short aliases and flags, such as `--matplotlib` (to integrate with a matplotlib GUI event loop) or `--pdb` (automatic post-mortem debugging of exceptions).

To see all of these abbreviated options, run:

    ipython --help
    jupyter notebook --help
    # etc.

Options specified at the command line, in either format, override options set in a configuration file.

### The config magic

You can also modify config from inside IPython, using a magic command:

    %config IPCompleter.greedy = True

At present, this only affects the current session - changes you make to config are not saved anywhere. Also, some options are only read when IPython starts, so they can't be changed like this.

### Running IPython from Python

If you are using \[embedding\](\#embedding) to start IPython from a normal python file, you can set configuration options the same way as in a config file by creating a traitlets <span class="title-ref">Config</span> object and passing it to start\_ipython like in the example below.

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="python">

../../../examples/Embedding/start\_ipython\_config.py

</div>

## Profiles

IPython can use multiple profiles, with separate configuration and history. By default, if you don't specify a profile, IPython always runs in the `default` profile. To use a new profile:

    ipython profile create foo   # create the profile foo
    ipython --profile=foo        # start IPython using the new profile

Profiles are typically stored in \[ipythondir\](\#ipythondir), but you can also keep a profile in the current working directory, for example to distribute it with a project. To find a profile directory on the filesystem:

    ipython locate profile foo

## The IPython directory

IPython stores its files---config, command history and extensions---in the directory `~/.ipython/` by default.

<div class="envvar">

IPYTHONDIR

If set, this environment variable should be the path to a directory, which IPython will use for user data. IPython will create it if it does not exist.

</div>

<div class="option">

\--ipython-dir=\<path\>

This command line option can also be used to override the default IPython directory.

</div>

To see where IPython is looking for the IPython directory, use the command `ipython locate`, or the Python function <span class="title-ref">IPython.paths.get\_ipython\_dir</span>.

## Systemwide configuration

It can be useful to deploy systemwide ipython or ipykernel configuration when managing environment for many users. At startup time IPython and IPykernel will search for configuration file in multiple systemwide locations, mainly:

>   - `/etc/ipython/`
>   - `/usr/local/etc/ipython/`

When the global install is a standalone python distribution it may also search in distribution specific location, for example:

>   - `$ANACONDA_LOCATION/etc/ipython/`

In those locations, Terminal IPython will look for a file called `ipython_config.py` and `ipython_config.json`, ipykernel will look for `ipython_kernel_config.py` and `ipython_kernel.json`.

Configuration files are loaded in order and merged with configuration on later location taking precedence on earlier locations (that is to say a user can overwrite a systemwide configuration option).

You can see all locations in which IPython is looking for configuration files by starting ipython in debug mode:

    $ ipython --debug -c 'exit()'

Identically with ipykernel though the command is currently blocking until this process is killed with `Ctrl-\`:

    $ python -m ipykernel --debug

# Mime Renderer Extensions

Like it's cousins, Jupyter Notebooks and JupyterLab, Terminal IPython can be thought to render a number of mimetypes in the shell. This can be used to either display inline images if your terminal emulator supports it; or open some display results with external file viewers.

Registering new mimetype handlers can so far only be done by extensions and requires 4 steps:

>   - Define a callable that takes 2 parameters:`data` and `metadata`; return value of the callable is so far ignored. This callable is responsible for "displaying" the given mimetype. Which can be sending the right escape sequences and bytes to the current terminal; or open an external program. -
>   - Appending the right mimetype to `ipython.display_formatter.active_types` for IPython to know it should not ignore those mimetypes.
>   - Enabling the given mimetype: `ipython.display_formatter.formatters[mime].enabled = True`
>   - Registering above callable with mimetype handler: `ipython.mime_renderers[mime] = handler`

Here is a complete IPython extension to display images inline and convert math to png, before displaying it inline for iterm2 on macOS :

    from base64 import encodebytes
    from IPython.lib.latextools import latex_to_png

    def mathcat(data, meta):
        png = latex_to_png(f'$${data}$$'.replace('\displaystyle', '').replace('$$$', '$$'))
        imcat(png, meta)
    
    IMAGE_CODE = '\033]1337;File=name=name;inline=true;:{}\a'
    
    def imcat(image_data, metadata):
        try:
            print(IMAGE_CODE.format(encodebytes(image_data).decode()))
        # bug workaround
        except:
            print(IMAGE_CODE.format(image_data))
    
    def register_mimerenderer(ipython, mime, handler):
        ipython.display_formatter.active_types.append(mime)
        ipython.display_formatter.formatters[mime].enabled = True
        ipython.mime_renderers[mime] = handler
    
    def load_ipython_extension(ipython):
        register_mimerenderer(ipython, 'image/png', imcat)
        register_mimerenderer(ipython, 'image/jpeg', imcat)
        register_mimerenderer(ipython, 'text/latex', mathcat)

This example only work for iterm2 on macOS and skip error handling for brevity. One could also invoke an external viewer with `subprocess.run()` and a temporary file, which is left as an exercise.

# Guide for IPython core Developers

This guide documents the development of IPython itself. Alternatively, developers of third party tools and libraries that use IPython should see the \[../development/index\](../development/index.md).

For instructions on how to make a developer install see \[devinstall\](\#devinstall).

## Backporting Pull requests

All pull requests should usually be made against `main`, if a Pull Request need to be backported to an earlier release; then it should be tagged with the correct `milestone`.

If you tag a pull request with a milestone **before** merging the pull request, and the base ref is `main`, then our backport bot should automatically create a corresponding pull-request that backport on the correct branch.

If you have write access to the IPython repository you can also just mention the **backport bot** to do the work for you. The bot is evolving so instructions may be different. At the time of this writing you can use:

    @meeseeksdev[bot] backport [to] <branchname>

The bot will attempt to backport the current pull-request and issue a PR if possible.

\> **Note** \> The `@` and `[bot]` when mentioning the bot should be optional and can be omitted.

If the pull request cannot be automatically backported, the bot should tell you so on the PR and apply a "Need manual backport" tag to the origin PR.

## IPython release process

This document contains the process that is used to create an IPython release.

Conveniently, the `release` script in the `tools` directory of the `IPython` repository automates most of the release process. This document serves as a handy reminder and checklist for the release manager.

During the release process, you might need the extra following dependencies:

>   - `keyring` to access your GitHub authentication tokens
>   - `graphviz` to generate some graphs in the documentation
>   - `ghpro` to generate the stats

Make sure you have all the required dependencies to run the tests as well.

You can try to `source tools/release_helper.sh` when releasing via bash, it should guide you through most of the process.

### 1\. Set Environment variables

Set environment variables to document previous release tag, current release milestone, current release version, and git tag.

These variables may be used later to copy/paste as answers to the script questions instead of typing the appropriate command when the time comes. These variables are not used by the scripts directly; therefore, there is no need to `export` them. The format for bash is as follows, but note that these values are just an example valid only for the 5.0 release; you'll need to update them for the release you are actually making:

    PREV_RELEASE=4.2.1
    MILESTONE=5.0
    VERSION=5.0.0
    BRANCH=main

For [reproducibility of builds](https://reproducible-builds.org/specs/source-date-epoch/), we recommend setting `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` prior to running the build; record the used value of `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` as it may not be available from build artifact. You should be able to use `date +%s` to get a formatted timestamp:

    SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH=$(date +%s)

### 2\. Create GitHub stats and finish release note

\> **Note** \> This step is optional if making a Beta or RC release.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Before generating the GitHub stats, verify that all closed issues and pull requests have [appropriate milestones](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-GitHub-workflow#milestones). [This search](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?q=is%3Aclosed+no%3Amilestone+is%3Aissue) should return no results before creating the GitHub stats.

</div>

If a major release:

>   - merge any pull request notes into what's new:
>     
>         python tools/update_whatsnew.py
> 
>   - update `docs/source/whatsnew/development.rst`, to ensure it covers the major release features
> 
>   - move the contents of `development.rst` to `versionX.rst` where `X` is the numerical release version
> 
>   - generate summary of GitHub contributions, which can be done with:
>

Add the cleaned `stats.rst` results to `docs/source/whatsnew/github-stats-X.rst` where `X` is the numerical release version (don't forget to add it to the git repository as well). If creating a major release, make a new `github-stats-X.rst` file; if creating a minor release, the content from `stats.rst` may simply be added to the top of an existing `github-stats-X.rst` file.

To find duplicates and update <span class="title-ref">.mailmap</span>, use:

    git log --format="%aN <%aE>" $PREV_RELEASE... | sort -u -f

If a minor release you might need to do some of the above points manually, and forward port the changes.

### 3\. Make sure the repository is clean

  - of any file that could be problematic.  
    Remove all non-tracked files with:
    
        git clean -xfdi
    
    This will ask for confirmation before removing all untracked files. Make sure the `dist/` folder is clean to avoid any stale builds from previous build attempts.

### 4\. Update the release version number

Edit `IPython/core/release.py` to have the current version.

in particular, update version number and `_version_extra` content in `IPython/core/release.py`.

Step 5 will validate your changes automatically, but you might still want to make sure the version number matches pep440.

In particular, `rc` and `beta` are not separated by `.` or the `sdist` and `bdist` will appear as different releases. For example, a valid version number for a release candidate (rc) release is: `1.3rc1`. Notice that there is no separator between the '3' and the 'r'. Check the environment variable `$VERSION` as well.

You will likely just have to modify/comment/uncomment one of the lines setting `_version_extra`

### 5\. Run the <span class="title-ref">tools/build\_release</span> script

Running `tools/build_release` does all the file checking and building that the real release script will do. This makes test installations, checks that the build procedure runs OK, and tests other steps in the release process.

The `build_release` script will in particular verify that the version number match PEP 440, in order to avoid surprise at the time of build upload.

We encourage creating a test build of the docs as well.

### 6\. Create and push the new tag

Commit the changes to release.py:

    git commit -am "release $VERSION" -S
    git push origin $BRANCH

(omit the `-S` if you are no signing the package)

Create and push the tag:

    git tag -am "release $VERSION" "$VERSION" -s
    git push origin $VERSION

(omit the `-s` if you are no signing the package)

Update release.py back to `x.y-dev` or `x.y-maint` commit and push:

    git commit -am "back to development" -S
    git push origin $BRANCH

(omit the `-S` if you are no signing the package)

Now checkout the tag we just made:

    git checkout $VERSION

### 7\. Run the release script

Run the `release` script, this step requires having a current wheel, Python \>=3.4 and Python 2.7.:

    ./tools/release

This makes the tarballs and wheels, and puts them under the `dist/` folder. Be sure to test the `wheels` and the `sdist` locally before uploading them to PyPI. We do not use an universal wheel as each wheel installs an `ipython2` or `ipython3` script, depending on the version of Python it is built for. Using an universal wheel would prevent this.

Check the shasum of files with:

    shasum -a 256 dist/*

and takes notes of them you might need them to update the conda-forge recipes. Rerun the command and check the hash have not changed:

    ./tools/release
    shasum -a 256 dist/*

Use the following to actually upload the result of the build:

    ./tools/release upload

It should posts them to `archive.ipython.org` and to PyPI.

PyPI/Warehouse will automatically hide previous releases. If you are uploading a non-stable version, make sure to log-in to PyPI and un-hide previous version.

### 8\. Draft a short release announcement

The announcement should include:

  - release highlights
  - a link to the html version of the *What's new* section of the documentation
  - a link to upgrade or installation tips (if necessary)

Post the announcement to the mailing list and or blog, and link from Twitter.

\> **Note** \> If you are doing a RC or Beta, you can likely skip the next steps.

### 9\. Update milestones on GitHub

These steps will bring milestones up to date:

  - close the just released milestone
  - open a new milestone for the next release (x, y+1), if the milestone doesn't exist already

### 10\. Update the IPython website

The IPython website should document the new release:

  - add release announcement (news, announcements)
  - update current version and download links
  - update links on the documentation page (especially if a major release)

### 11\. Update readthedocs

Make sure to update readthedocs and set the latest tag as stable, as well as checking that previous release is still building under its own tag.

### 12\. Update the Conda-Forge feedstock

Follow the instructions on [the repository](https://github.com/conda-forge/ipython-feedstock)

### 13\. Celebrate\!

Celebrate the release and please thank the contributors for their work. Great job\!

# Overview of the IPython configuration system

This section describes the IPython configuration system. This is based on `traitlets.config`; see that documentation for more information about the overall architecture.

## Configuration file location

So where should you put your configuration files? IPython uses "profiles" for configuration, and by default, all profiles will be stored in the so called "IPython directory". The location of this directory is determined by the following algorithm:

  - If the `ipython-dir` command line flag is given, its value is used.
  - If not, the value returned by <span class="title-ref">IPython.paths.get\_ipython\_dir</span> is used. This function will first look at the `IPYTHONDIR` environment variable and then default to `~/.ipython`. Historical support for the `IPYTHON_DIR` environment variable will be removed in a future release.

For most users, the configuration directory will be `~/.ipython`.

Previous versions of IPython on Linux would use the XDG config directory, creating `~/.config/ipython` by default. We have decided to go back to `~/.ipython` for consistency among systems. IPython will issue a warning if it finds the XDG location, and will move it to the new location if there isn't already a directory there.

Once the location of the IPython directory has been determined, you need to know which profile you are using. For users with a single configuration, this will simply be 'default', and will be located in `<IPYTHONDIR>/profile_default`.

The next thing you need to know is what to call your configuration file. The basic idea is that each application has its own default configuration filename. The default named used by the `ipython` command line program is `ipython_config.py`, and *all* IPython applications will use this file. The IPython kernel will load its own config file *after* `ipython_config.py`. To load a particular configuration file instead of the default, the name can be overridden by the `config_file` command line flag.

To generate the default configuration files, do:

    $ ipython profile create

and you will have a default `ipython_config.py` in your IPython directory under `profile_default`.

\> **Note** \> IPython configuration options are case sensitive, and IPython cannot catch misnamed keys or invalid values.

> By default IPython will also ignore any invalid configuration files.

<div class="versionadded">

5.0

IPython can be configured to abort in case of invalid configuration file. To do so set the environment variable `IPYTHON_SUPPRESS_CONFIG_ERRORS` to <span class="title-ref">'1'</span> or <span class="title-ref">'true'</span>

</div>

### Locating these files

From the command-line, you can quickly locate the IPYTHONDIR or a specific profile with:

``` bash
$ ipython locate
/home/you/.ipython

$ ipython locate profile foo
/home/you/.ipython/profile_foo
```

These map to the utility functions: <span class="title-ref">IPython.paths.get\_ipython\_dir</span> and <span class="title-ref">IPython.paths.locate\_profile</span> respectively.

## Profiles

A profile is a directory containing configuration and runtime files, such as logs, connection info for the parallel apps, and your IPython command history.

The idea is that users often want to maintain a set of configuration files for different purposes: one for doing numerical computing with NumPy and SciPy and another for doing symbolic computing with SymPy. Profiles make it easy to keep a separate configuration files, logs, and histories for each of these purposes.

Let's start by showing how a profile is used:

`` `bash     $ ipython --profile=sympy  This tells the :command:`ipython` command line program to get its configuration ``<span class="title-ref"> from the "sympy" profile. The file names for various profiles do not change. The only difference is that profiles are named in a special way. In the case above, the "sympy" profile means looking for :file:\`ipython\_config.py</span> in `<IPYTHONDIR>/profile_sympy`.

The general pattern is this: simply create a new profile with:

`` `bash     $ ipython profile create <name>  which adds a directory called ``[profile]()\<name\>`to your IPython directory. Then`<span class="title-ref"> you can load this profile by adding </span><span class="title-ref">--profile=\<name\></span>\` to your command line options. Profiles are supported by all IPython applications.

IPython extends the config loader for Python files so that you can inherit config from another profile. To do this, use a line like this in your Python config file:

``` python
load_subconfig('ipython_config.py', profile='default')
```

# Execution of cells in the IPython kernel

When IPython kernel receives [execute\_request](https://jupyter-client.readthedocs.io/en/latest/messaging.html#execute) with user code, it processes the message in the following phases:

1.  Fire the `pre_execute` event.
2.  Fire the `pre_run_cell` event unless silent is `True`.
3.  Execute `run_cell` method to preprocess `code`, compile and run it, see below for details.
4.  If execution succeeds, expressions in `user_expressions` are computed. This ensures that any error in the expressions don't affect the main code execution.
5.  Fire the `post_execute` event.
6.  Fire the `post_run_cell` event unless silent is `True`.

<div class="seealso">

\[/config/callbacks\](/config/callbacks.md)

</div>

# Running user `code`

First, the `code` cell is transformed to expand `%magic` and `!system` commands by `IPython.core.inputtransformer2`. Then expanded cell is compiled using standard Python <span class="title-ref">compile</span> function and executed.

Python <span class="title-ref">compile</span> function provides `mode` argument to select one of three ways of compiling code:

  - *single*  
    Valid for a single interactive statement (though the source can contain multiple lines, such as a for loop). When compiled in this mode, the generated bytecode contains special instructions that trigger the calling of <span class="title-ref">sys.displayhook</span> for any expression in the block that returns a value. This means that a single statement can actually produce multiple calls to <span class="title-ref">sys.displayhook</span>, if for example it contains a loop where each iteration computes an unassigned expression would generate 10 calls:
    
        for i in range(10):
            i**2

  - *exec*  
    An arbitrary amount of source code, this is how modules are compiled. <span class="title-ref">sys.displayhook</span> is *never* implicitly called.

  - *eval*  
    A single expression that returns a value. <span class="title-ref">sys.displayhook</span> is *never* implicitly called.

The `code` field is split into individual blocks each of which is valid for execution in 'single' mode, and then:

  - If there is only a single block: it is executed in 'single' mode.
  - If there is more than one block:
      - if the last block is a single line long, run all but the last in 'exec' mode and the very last one in 'single' mode. This makes it easy to type simple expressions at the end to see computed values.
      - if the last block is no more than two lines long, run all but the last in 'exec' mode and the very last one in 'single' mode. This makes it easy to type simple expressions at the end to see computed values. - otherwise (last one is also multiline), run all in 'exec' mode
      - otherwise (last block is also multiline), run all in 'exec' mode as a single unit.

# How IPython works

## Terminal IPython

When you type `ipython`, you get the original IPython interface, running in the terminal. It does something like this:

    while True:
        code = input(">>> ")
        exec(code)

Of course, it's much more complex, because it has to deal with multi-line code, tab completion using `readline`, magic commands, and so on. But the model is like that: prompt the user for some code, and when they've entered it, exec it in the same process. This model is often called a REPL, or Read-Eval-Print-Loop.

## The IPython Kernel

All the other interfacesâthe Notebook, the Qt console, `ipython console` in the terminal, and third party interfacesâuse the IPython Kernel. This is a separate process which is responsible for running user code, and things like computing possible completions. Frontends communicate with it using JSON messages sent over [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org/) sockets; the protocol they use is described in \[jupyterclient:messaging\](\#jupyterclient:messaging).

The core execution machinery for the kernel is shared with terminal IPython:

![image](figs/ipy_kernel_and_terminal.png)

A kernel process can be connected to more than one frontend simultaneously. In this case, the different frontends will have access to the same variables.

This design was intended to allow easy development of different frontends based on the same kernel, but it also made it possible to support new languages in the same frontends, by developing kernels in those languages, and we are refining IPython to make that more practical.

Today, there are two ways to develop a kernel for another language. Wrapper kernels reuse the communications machinery from IPython, and implement only the core execution part. Native kernels implement execution and communications in the target language:

![image](figs/other_kernels.png)

Wrapper kernels are easier to write quickly for languages that have good Python wrappers, like [octave\_kernel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/octave_kernel), or languages where it's impractical to implement the communications machinery, like [bash\_kernel](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bash_kernel). Native kernels are likely to be better maintained by the community using them, like [IJulia](https://github.com/JuliaLang/IJulia.jl) or [IHaskell](https://github.com/gibiansky/IHaskell).

# IPython GUI Support Notes

IPython allows GUI event loops to be run in an interactive IPython session. This is done using Python's PyOS\_InputHook hook which Python calls when the <span class="title-ref">raw\_input</span> function is called and waiting for user input. IPython has versions of this hook for wx, pyqt4 and pygtk.

When a GUI program is used interactively within IPython, the event loop of the GUI should *not* be started. This is because, the PyOS\_Inputhook itself is responsible for iterating the GUI event loop.

IPython has facilities for installing the needed input hook for each GUI toolkit and for creating the needed main GUI application object. Usually, these main application objects should be created only once and for some GUI toolkits, special options have to be passed to the application object to enable it to function properly in IPython.

We need to answer the following questions:

  - Who is responsible for creating the main GUI application object, IPython or third parties (matplotlib, enthought.traits, etc.)?
  - What is the proper way for third party code to detect if a GUI application object has already been created? If one has been created, how should the existing instance be retrieved?
  - In a GUI application object has been created, how should third party code detect if the GUI event loop is running. It is not sufficient to call the relevant function methods in the GUI toolkits (like `IsMainLoopRunning`) because those don't know if the GUI event loop is running through the input hook.
  - We might need a way for third party code to determine if it is running in IPython or not. Currently, the only way of running GUI code in IPython is by using the input hook, but eventually, GUI based versions of IPython will allow the GUI event loop in the more traditional manner. We will need a way for third party code to distinguish between these two cases.

Here is some sample code I have been using to debug this issue:

    from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
    
    from enthought.traits import api as traits
    
    class Foo(traits.HasTraits):
        a = traits.Float()
    
    f = Foo()
    f.configure_traits()
    
    plt.plot(range(10))

# New IPython Console Lexer

<div class="versionadded">

2.0.0

</div>

The IPython console lexer has been rewritten and now supports tracebacks and customized input/output prompts. An entire suite of lexers is now available at `IPython.lib.lexers`. These include:

  - IPythonLexer & IPython3Lexer  
    Lexers for pure IPython (python + magic/shell commands)

  - IPythonPartialTracebackLexer & IPythonTracebackLexer  
    Supports 2.x and 3.x via the keyword <span class="title-ref">python3</span>. The partial traceback lexer reads everything but the Python code appearing in a traceback. The full lexer combines the partial lexer with an IPython lexer.

  - IPythonConsoleLexer  
    A lexer for IPython console sessions, with support for tracebacks. Supports 2.x and 3.x via the keyword <span class="title-ref">python3</span>.

  - IPyLexer  
    A friendly lexer which examines the first line of text and from it, decides whether to use an IPython lexer or an IPython console lexer. Supports 2.x and 3.x via the keyword <span class="title-ref">python3</span>.

Previously, the <span class="title-ref">IPythonConsoleLexer</span> class was available at `IPython.sphinxext.ipython_console_hightlight`. It was inserted into Pygments' list of available lexers under the name <span class="title-ref">ipython</span>. It should be mentioned that this name is inaccurate, since an IPython console session is not the same as IPython code (which itself is a superset of the Python language).

Now, the Sphinx extension inserts two console lexers into Pygments' list of available lexers. Both are IPyLexer instances under the names: <span class="title-ref">ipython</span> and <span class="title-ref">ipython3</span>. Although the names can be confusing (as mentioned above), their continued use is, in part, to maintain backwards compatibility and to aid typical usage. If a project needs to make Pygments aware of more than just the IPyLexer class, then one should not make the IPyLexer class available under the name <span class="title-ref">ipython</span> and use <span class="title-ref">ipy</span> or some other non-conflicting value.

Code blocks such as:

`` `rst     .. code-block:: ipython          In [1]: 2**2         Out[1]: 4  will continue to work as before, but now, they will also properly highlight ``\` tracebacks. For pure IPython code, the same lexer will also work:

`` `rst     .. code-block:: ipython          x = ''.join(map(str, range(10)))         !echo $x  Since the first line of the block did not begin with a standard IPython console ``\` prompt, the entire block is assumed to consist of IPython code instead.

# Making simple Python wrapper kernels

<div class="versionadded">

3.0

</div>

You can now re-use the kernel machinery in IPython to easily make new kernels. This is useful for languages that have Python bindings, such as [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave/) (via [Oct2Py](http://blink1073.github.io/oct2py/)), or languages where the REPL can be controlled in a tty using [pexpect](https://pexpect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), such as bash.

<div class="seealso">

  - [bash\_kernel](https://github.com/takluyver/bash_kernel)  
    A simple kernel for bash, written using this machinery

</div>

## Required steps

Subclass <span class="title-ref">ipykernel.kernelbase.Kernel</span>, and implement the following methods and attributes:

<div class="MyKernel">

<div class="attribute">

implementation implementation\_version language language\_version banner

Information for \[msging\_kernel\_info\](\#msging\_kernel\_info) replies. 'Implementation' refers to the kernel (e.g. IPython), and 'language' refers to the language it interprets (e.g. Python). The 'banner' is displayed to the user in console UIs before the first prompt. All of these values are strings.

</div>

<div class="attribute">

language\_info

Language information for \[msging\_kernel\_info\](\#msging\_kernel\_info) replies, in a dictionary. This should contain the key `mimetype` with the mimetype of code in the target language (e.g. `'text/x-python'`), and `file_extension` (e.g. `'py'`). It may also contain keys `codemirror_mode` and `pygments_lexer` if they need to differ from <span class="title-ref">language</span>.

Other keys may be added to this later.

</div>

<div class="method">

do\_execute(code, silent, store\_history=True, user\_expressions=None, allow\_stdin=False)

Execute user code.

  - param str code  
    The code to be executed.

  - param bool silent  
    Whether to display output.

  - param bool store\_history  
    Whether to record this code in history and increase the execution count. If silent is True, this is implicitly False.

  - param dict user\_expressions  
    Mapping of names to expressions to evaluate after the code has run. You can ignore this if you need to.

  - param bool allow\_stdin  
    Whether the frontend can provide input on request (e.g. for Python's <span class="title-ref">raw\_input</span>).

Your method should return a dict containing the fields described in \[execution\_results\](\#execution\_results). To display output, it can send messages using <span class="title-ref">\~ipykernel.kernelbase.Kernel.send\_response</span>. See \[messaging\](messaging.md) for details of the different message types.

</div>

</div>

To launch your kernel, add this at the end of your module:

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from ipykernel.kernelapp import IPKernelApp
        IPKernelApp.launch_instance(kernel_class=MyKernel)

## Example

`echokernel.py` will simply echo any input it's given to stdout:

    from ipykernel.kernelbase import Kernel
    
    class EchoKernel(Kernel):
        implementation = 'Echo'
        implementation_version = '1.0'
        language = 'no-op'
        language_version = '0.1'
        language_info = {'mimetype': 'text/plain'}
        banner = "Echo kernel - as useful as a parrot"
    
        def do_execute(self, code, silent, store_history=True, user_expressions=None,
                       allow_stdin=False):
            if not silent:
                stream_content = {'name': 'stdout', 'text': code}
                self.send_response(self.iopub_socket, 'stream', stream_content)
    
            return {'status': 'ok',
                    # The base class increments the execution count
                    'execution_count': self.execution_count,
                    'payload': [],
                    'user_expressions': {},
                   }
    
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        from ipykernel.kernelapp import IPKernelApp
        IPKernelApp.launch_instance(kernel_class=EchoKernel)

Here's the Kernel spec `kernel.json` file for this:

    {"argv":["python","-m","echokernel", "-f", "{connection_file}"],
     "display_name":"Echo"
    }

## Optional steps

You can override a number of other methods to improve the functionality of your kernel. All of these methods should return a dictionary as described in the relevant section of the \[messaging spec \<messaging\>\](messaging spec \<messaging\>.md).

<div class="MyBetterKernel">

<div class="method">

do\_complete(code, cusor\_pos)

Code completion

  - param str code  
    The code already present

  - param int cursor\_pos  
    The position in the code where completion is requested

<div class="seealso">

\[msging\_completion\](\#msging\_completion) messages

</div>

</div>

<div class="method">

do\_inspect(code, cusor\_pos, detail\_level=0)

Object introspection

  - param str code  
    The code

  - param int cursor\_pos  
    The position in the code where introspection is requested

  - param int detail\_level  
    0 or 1 for more or less detail. In IPython, 1 gets the source code.

<div class="seealso">

\[msging\_inspection\](\#msging\_inspection) messages

</div>

</div>

Welcome to the official IPython documentation.

IPython provides a rich toolkit to help you make the most of using Python interactively. Its main components are:

  - A powerful interactive Python shell.
    
    > ![Screenshot of IPython 6.0](./_images/ipython-6-screenshot.png)

  - A [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) kernel to work with Python code in Jupyter notebooks and other interactive frontends.

The enhanced interactive Python shells and kernel have the following main features:

  - Comprehensive object introspection.
  - Input history, persistent across sessions.
  - Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.
  - Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.
  - Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.
  - A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing `$PYTHONSTARTUP` environment variables every time).
  - Session logging and reloading.
  - Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
  - Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
  - Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.
  - Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

The Command line interface inherits the above functionality and adds

  - real multi-line editing thanks to [prompt\_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
  - syntax highlighting as you type.
  - integration with command line editor for a better workflow.

The kernel also has its share of features. When used with a compatible frontend, it allows:

  - the object to create a rich display of Html, Images, Latex, Sound and Video.
  - interactive widgets with the use of the [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) package.

This documentation will walk you through most of the features of the IPython command line and kernel, as well as describe the internal mechanisms in order to improve your Python workflow.

You can find the table of content for this documentation in the left sidebar, allowing you to come back to previous sections or skip ahead, if needed.

# Installation

<div class="toctree" data-maxdepth="3" hidden="">

install kernel\_install

</div>

This sections will guide you through \[installing IPython itself \<install\>\](\#installing-ipython-itself-\<install\>), and installing \[kernels for Jupyter \<kernel\_install\>\](\#kernels-for-jupyter-\<kernel\_install\>) if you wish to work with multiple version of Python, or multiple environments.

## Quick install reminder

Here is a quick reminder of the commands needed for installation if you are already familiar with IPython and are just searching to refresh your memory:

Install IPython:

`` `bash     $ pip install ipython   Install and register an IPython kernel with Jupyter:   .. code-block:: bash      $ python -m pip install ipykernel      $ python -m ipykernel install [--user] [--name <machine-readable-name>] [--display-name <"User Friendly Name">]  for more help see   .. code-block:: bash      $ python -m ipykernel install  --help    .. seealso::     `Installing Jupyter <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`__      The Notebook, nbconvert, and many other former pieces of IPython are now      part of Project Jupyter. ``\`

# Installing IPython

IPython 6 requires Python â¥ 3.3. IPython 5.x can be installed on Python 2.

## Quick Install

With `pip` already installed :

`` `bash     $ pip install ipython  This installs IPython as well as its dependencies.  If you want to use IPython with notebooks or the Qt console, you should also ``<span class="title-ref"> install Jupyter </span><span class="title-ref">pip install jupyter</span>\`.

## Overview

This document describes in detail the steps required to install IPython. For a few quick ways to get started with package managers or full Python distributions, see [the install page](https://ipython.org/install.html) of the IPython website.

Please let us know if you have problems installing IPython or any of its dependencies.

IPython and most dependencies should be installed via `pip`. In many scenarios, this is the simplest method of installing Python packages. More information about `pip` can be found on [its PyPI page](https://pip.pypa.io).

More general information about installing Python packages can be found in [Python's documentation](http://docs.python.org).

### Dependencies

IPython relies on a number of other Python packages. Installing using a package manager like pip or conda will ensure the necessary packages are installed. Manual installation without dependencies is possible, but not recommended. The dependencies can be viewed with package manager commands, such as `pip show ipython` or `conda info ipython`.

### Installing IPython itself

IPython requires several dependencies to work correctly, it is not recommended to install IPython and all its dependencies manually as this can be quite long and troublesome. You should use the python package manager `pip`.

### Installation using pip

Make sure you have the latest version of `pip` (the Python package manager) installed. If you do not, head to [Pip documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/) and install `pip` first.

The quickest way to get up and running with IPython is to install it with pip:

`` `bash     $ pip install ipython  That's it.   Installation from source ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

To install IPython from source, grab the latest stable tarball of IPython [from PyPI](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ipython). Then do the following:

`` `bash     tar -xzf ipython-5.1.0.tar.gz     cd ipython-5.1.0     # The [test] extra ensures test dependencies are installed too:     pip install '.[test]'  Do not invoke ``setup.py`directly as this can have undesirable consequences`<span class="title-ref"> for further upgrades. We do not recommend using </span><span class="title-ref">easy\_install</span>\` either.

If you are installing to a location (like `/usr/local`) that requires higher permissions, you may need to run the last command with `sudo`. You can also install in user specific location by using the `--user` flag in conjunction with pip.

To run IPython's test suite, use the `pytest` command:

`` `bash     $ pytest  .. _devinstall:  Installing the development version ``\` \~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~\~

It is also possible to install the development version of IPython from our [Git](http://git-scm.com/) source code repository. To do this you will need to have Git installed on your system.

Then do:

`` `bash     $ git clone https://github.com/ipython/ipython.git     $ cd ipython     $ pip install -e '.[test]'  The :command:`pip install -e .` command allows users and developers to follow ``\` the development branch as it changes by creating links in the right places and installing the command line scripts to the appropriate locations.

Then, if you want to update your IPython at any time, do:

`` `bash     $ git pull  If the dependencies or entrypoints have changed, you may have to run  .. code-block:: bash      $ pip install -e .  again, but this is infrequent. ``\`

# Installing the IPython kernel

<div class="seealso">

  - \[Installing Jupyter \<jupyter:install\>\](\#installing-jupyter-\<jupyter:install\>)  
    The IPython kernel is the Python execution backend for Jupyter.

</div>

The Jupyter Notebook and other frontends automatically ensure that the IPython kernel is available. However, if you want to use a kernel with a different version of Python, or in a virtualenv or conda environment, you'll need to install that manually.

## Kernels for Python 2 and 3

If you're running Jupyter on Python 3, you can set up a Python 2 kernel after checking your version of pip is greater than 9.0:

    python2 -m pip --version

Then install with :

    python2 -m pip install ipykernel
    python2 -m ipykernel install --user

Or using conda, create a Python 2 environment:

    conda create -n ipykernel_py2 python=2 ipykernel
    source activate ipykernel_py2    # On Windows, remove the word 'source'
    python -m ipykernel install --user

\> **Note** \> IPython 6.0 stopped support for Python 2, so installing IPython on Python 2 will give you an older version (5.x series).

If you're running Jupyter on Python 2 and want to set up a Python 3 kernel, follow the same steps, replacing `2` with `3`.

The last command installs a \[kernel spec \<jupyterclient:kernelspecs\>\](\#kernel-spec-\<jupyterclient:kernelspecs\>) file for the current python installation. Kernel spec files are JSON files, which can be viewed and changed with a normal text editor.

## Kernels for different environments

If you want to have multiple IPython kernels for different virtualenvs or conda environments, you will need to specify unique names for the kernelspecs.

Make sure you have ipykernel installed in your environment. If you are using `pip` to install `ipykernel` in a conda env, make sure `pip` is installed:

``` bash
source activate myenv
conda install pip
conda install ipykernel # or pip install ipykernel
```

For example, using conda environments, install a `Python (myenv)` Kernel in a first environment:

``` bash
source activate myenv
python -m ipykernel install --user --name myenv --display-name "Python (myenv)"
```

And in a second environment, after making sure ipykernel is installed in it:

``` bash
source activate other-env
python -m ipykernel install --user --name other-env --display-name "Python (other-env)"
```

The `--name` value is used by Jupyter internally. These commands will overwrite any existing kernel with the same name. `--display-name` is what you see in the notebook menus.

Using virtualenv or conda envs, you can make your IPython kernel in one env available to Jupyter in a different env. To do so, run ipykernel install from the kernel's env, with --prefix pointing to the Jupyter env:

``` bash
/path/to/kernel/env/bin/python -m ipykernel install --prefix=/path/to/jupyter/env --name 'python-my-env'
```

Note that this command will create a new configuration for the kernel in one of the preferred location (see `jupyter --paths` command for more details):

  - system-wide (e.g. /usr/local/share),
  - in Jupyter's env (sys.prefix/share),
  - per-user (\~/.local/share or \~/Library/share)

If you want to edit the kernelspec before installing it, you can do so in two steps. First, ask IPython to write its spec to a temporary location:

``` bash
ipython kernel install --prefix /tmp
```

edit the files in /tmp/share/jupyter/kernels/python3 to your liking, then when you are ready, tell Jupyter to install it (this will copy the files into a place Jupyter will look):

``` bash
jupyter kernelspec install /tmp/share/jupyter/kernels/python3
```

# Asynchronous in REPL: Autoawait

\> **Note** \> This feature is experimental and behavior can change between python and IPython version without prior deprecation.

Starting with IPython 7.0, and when using Python 3.6 and above, IPython offer the ability to run asynchronous code from the REPL. Constructs which are <span class="title-ref">SyntaxError</span> s in the Python REPL can be used seamlessly in IPython.

The examples given here are for terminal IPython, running async code in a notebook interface or any other frontend using the Jupyter protocol needs IPykernel version 5.0 or above. The details of how async code runs in IPykernel will differ between IPython, IPykernel and their versions.

When a supported library is used, IPython will automatically allow Futures and Coroutines in the REPL to be `await` ed. This will happen if an \[await \<await\>\](\#await \<await\>) (or any other async constructs like async-with, async-for) is used at top level scope, or if any structure valid only in [async def](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/compound_stmts.html#async-def) function context are present. For example, the following being a syntax error in the Python REPL:

    Python 3.6.0 
    [GCC 4.2.1]
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import aiohttp
    >>> session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
    >>> result = session.get('https://api.github.com')
    >>> response = await result
      File "<stdin>", line 1
        response = await result
                              ^
    SyntaxError: invalid syntax

Should behave as expected in the IPython REPL:

    Python 3.6.0
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 7.0.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
    
    In [1]: import aiohttp
       ...: session = aiohttp.ClientSession()
       ...: result = session.get('https://api.github.com')
    
    In [2]: response = await result
    <pause for a few 100s ms>
    
    In [3]: await response.json()
    Out[3]:
    {'authorizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/authorizations',
     'code_search_url': 'https://api.github.com/search/code?q={query}...',
    ...
    }

You can use the `c.InteractiveShell.autoawait` configuration option and set it to `False` to deactivate automatic wrapping of asynchronous code. You can also use the `%autoawait` magic to toggle the behavior at runtime:

    In [1]: %autoawait False
    
    In [2]: %autoawait
    IPython autoawait is `Off`, and set to use `asyncio`

By default IPython will assume integration with Python's provided `asyncio`, but integration with other libraries is provided. In particular we provide experimental integration with the `curio` and `trio` library.

You can switch the current integration by using the `c.InteractiveShell.loop_runner` option or the `autoawait <name integration>` magic.

For example:

    In [1]: %autoawait trio
    
    In [2]: import trio
    
    In [3]: async def child(i):
       ...:     print("   child %s goes to sleep"%i)
       ...:     await trio.sleep(2)
       ...:     print("   child %s wakes up"%i)
    
    In [4]: print('parent start')
       ...: async with trio.open_nursery() as n:
       ...:     for i in range(5):
       ...:         n.spawn(child, i)
       ...: print('parent end')
    parent start
       child 2 goes to sleep
       child 0 goes to sleep
       child 3 goes to sleep
       child 1 goes to sleep
       child 4 goes to sleep
       <about 2 seconds pause>
       child 2 wakes up
       child 1 wakes up
       child 0 wakes up
       child 3 wakes up
       child 4 wakes up
    parent end

In the above example, `async with` at top level scope is a syntax error in Python.

Using this mode can have unexpected consequences if used in interaction with other features of IPython and various registered extensions. In particular if you are a direct or indirect user of the AST transformers, these may not apply to your code.

When using command line IPython, the default loop (or runner) does not process in the background, so top level asynchronous code must finish for the REPL to allow you to enter more code. As with usual Python semantics, the awaitables are started only when awaited for the first time. That is to say, in first example, no network request is done between `In[1]` and `In[2]`.

## Effects on IPython.embed()

IPython core being asynchronous, the use of `IPython.embed()` will now require a loop to run. By default IPython will use a fake coroutine runner which should allow `IPython.embed()` to be nested. Though this will prevent usage of the `%autoawait` feature when using IPython embed.

You can set a coroutine runner explicitly for `embed()` if you want to run asynchronous code, though the exact behavior is undefined.

## Effects on Magics

A couple of magics (`%%timeit`, `%timeit`, `%%time`, `%%prun`) have not yet been updated to work with asynchronous code and will raise syntax errors when trying to use top-level `await`. We welcome any contribution to help fix those, and extra cases we haven't caught yet. We hope for better support in Core Python for top-level Async code.

## Internals

As running asynchronous code is not supported in interactive REPL (as of Python 3.7) we have to rely to a number of complex workarounds and heuristics to allow this to happen. It is interesting to understand how this works in order to comprehend potential bugs, or provide a custom runner.

Among the many approaches that are at our disposition, we find only one that suited out need. Under the hood we use the code object from a async-def function and run it in global namespace after modifying it to not create a new `locals()` scope:

    async def inner_async():
        locals().update(**global_namespace)
        #
        # here is user code
        #
        return last_user_statement
    codeobj = modify(inner_async.__code__)
    coroutine = eval(codeobj, user_ns)
    display(loop_runner(coroutine))

The first thing you'll notice is that unlike classical `exec`, there is only one namespace. Second, user code runs in a function scope, and not a module scope.

On top of the above there are significant modification to the AST of `function`, and `loop_runner` can be arbitrary complex. So there is a significant overhead to this kind of code.

By default the generated coroutine function will be consumed by Asyncio's `loop_runner = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete()` method if `async` mode is deemed necessary, otherwise the coroutine will just be exhausted in a simple runner. It is possible, though, to change the default runner.

A loop runner is a *synchronous* function responsible from running a coroutine object.

The runner is responsible for ensuring that `coroutine` runs to completion, and it should return the result of executing the coroutine. Let's write a runner for `trio` that print a message when used as an exercise, `trio` is special as it usually prefers to run a function object and make a coroutine by itself, we can get around this limitation by wrapping it in an async-def without parameters and passing this value to `trio`:

    In [1]: import trio
       ...: from types import CoroutineType
       ...:
       ...: def trio_runner(coro:CoroutineType):
       ...:     print('running asynchronous code')
       ...:     async def corowrap(coro):
       ...:         return await coro
       ...:     return trio.run(corowrap, coro)

We can set it up by passing it to `%autoawait`:

    In [2]: %autoawait trio_runner
    
    In [3]: async def async_hello(name):
       ...:     await trio.sleep(1)
       ...:     print(f'Hello {name} world !')
       ...:     await trio.sleep(1)
    
    In [4]: await async_hello('async')
    running asynchronous code
    Hello async world !

Asynchronous programming in python (and in particular in the REPL) is still a relatively young subject. We expect some code to not behave as you expect, so feel free to contribute improvements to this codebase and give us feedback.

We invite you to thoroughly test this feature and report any unexpected behavior as well as propose any improvement.

## Using Autoawait in a notebook (IPykernel)

Update ipykernel to version 5.0 or greater:

    pip install ipykernel ipython --upgrade
    # or
    conda install ipykernel ipython --upgrade

This should automatically enable `autoawait` integration. Unlike terminal IPython, all code runs on `asyncio` eventloop, so creating a loop by hand will not work, including with magics like `%run` or other frameworks that create the eventloop themselves. In cases like these you can try to use projects like [nest\_asyncio](https://github.com/erdewit/nest_asyncio) and follow [this discussion](https://github.com/jupyter/notebook/issues/3397#issuecomment-419386811)

## Difference between terminal IPython and IPykernel

The exact asynchronous code running behavior varies between Terminal IPython and IPykernel. The root cause of this behavior is due to IPykernel having a *persistent* <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span> loop running, while Terminal IPython starts and stops a loop for each code block. This can lead to surprising behavior in some cases if you are used to manipulating asyncio loop yourself, see for example `11303` for a longer discussion but here are some of the astonishing cases.

This behavior is an implementation detail, and should not be relied upon. It can change without warnings in future versions of IPython.

In terminal IPython a loop is started for each code blocks only if there is top level async code:

    $ ipython
    In [1]: import asyncio
       ...: asyncio.get_event_loop()
    Out[1]: <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=False closed=False debug=False>
    
    In [2]:
    
    In [2]: import asyncio
       ...: await asyncio.sleep(0)
       ...: asyncio.get_event_loop()
    Out[2]: <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=True closed=False debug=False>

See that `running` is `True` only in the case were we `await sleep()`

In a Notebook, with ipykernel the asyncio eventloop is always running:

    $ jupyter notebook
    In [1]: import asyncio
       ...: loop1 = asyncio.get_event_loop()
       ...: loop1
    Out[1]: <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=True closed=False debug=False>
    
    In [2]: loop2 = asyncio.get_event_loop()
       ...: loop2
    Out[2]: <_UnixSelectorEventLoop running=True closed=False debug=False>
    
    In [3]: loop1 is loop2
    Out[3]: True

In Terminal IPython background tasks are only processed while the foreground task is running, if and only if the foreground task is async:

    $ ipython
    In [1]: import asyncio
       ...:
       ...: async def repeat(msg, n):
       ...:     for i in range(n):
       ...:         print(f"{msg} {i}")
       ...:         await asyncio.sleep(1)
       ...:     return f"{msg} done"
       ...:
       ...: asyncio.ensure_future(repeat("background", 10))
    Out[1]: <Task pending coro=<repeat() running at <ipython-input-1-02d0ef250fe7>:3>>
    
    In [2]: await asyncio.sleep(3)
    background 0
    background 1
    background 2
    background 3
    
    In [3]: import time
    ...: time.sleep(5)
    
    In [4]: await asyncio.sleep(3)
    background 4
    background 5
    background 6g

In a Notebook, QtConsole, or any other frontend using IPykernel, background tasks should behave as expected.

# Built-in magic commands

\> **Note** \> To Jupyter users: Magics are specific to and provided by the IPython kernel. Whether Magics are available on a kernel is a decision that is made by the kernel developer on a per-kernel basis. To work properly, Magics must use a syntax element which is not valid in the underlying language. For example, the IPython kernel uses the <span class="title-ref">%</span> syntax element for Magics as <span class="title-ref">%</span> is not a valid unary operator in Python. However, <span class="title-ref">%</span> might have meaning in other languages.

Here is the help auto-generated from the docstrings of all the available Magics functions that IPython ships with.

You can create and register your own Magics with IPython. You can find many user defined Magics on [PyPI](https://pypi.org). Feel free to publish your own and use the `Framework :: IPython` trove classifier.

# Rich Outputs

One of the main feature of IPython when used as a kernel is its ability to show rich output. This means that object that can be representing as image, sounds, animation, (etc...) can be shown this way if the frontend support it.

In order for this to be possible, you need to use the `display()` function, that should be available by default on IPython 5.4+ and 6.1+, or that you can import with `from IPython.display import display`. Then use `display(<your object>)` instead of `print()`, and if possible your object will be displayed with a richer representation. In the terminal of course, there won't be much difference as object are most of the time represented by text, but in notebook and similar interface you will get richer outputs.

# Plotting

\> **Note** \> Starting with IPython 5.0 and matplotlib 2.0 you can avoid the use of IPython's specific magic and use `matplotlib.pyplot.ion()`/`matplotlib.pyplot.ioff()` which have the advantages of working outside of IPython as well.

One major feature of the IPython kernel is the ability to display plots that are the output of running code cells. The IPython kernel is designed to work seamlessly with the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) plotting library to provide this functionality.

To set this up, before any plotting or import of matplotlib is performed you may execute the `%matplotlib` \[magic command \<magics\_explained\>\](\#magic-command-\<magics\_explained\>). This performs the necessary behind-the-scenes setup for IPython to work correctly hand in hand with `matplotlib`; it does *not*, however, actually execute any Python `import` commands, that is, no names are added to the namespace.

If you do not use the `%matplotlib` magic or you call it without an argument, the output of a plotting command is displayed using the default `matplotlib` backend, which may be different depending on Operating System and whether running within Jupyter or not.

Alternatively, the backend can be explicitly requested using, for example:

    %matplotlib gtk

The argument passed to the `%matplotlib` magic command may be the name of any backend understood by `matplotlib` or it may the name of a GUI loop such as `qt` or `osx`, in which case an appropriate backend supporting that GUI loop will be selected. To obtain a full list of all backends and GUI loops understood by `matplotlib` use `%matplotlib --list`.

There are some specific backends that are used in the Jupyter ecosystem:

  - The `inline` backend is provided by IPython and can be used in Jupyter Lab, Notebook and QtConsole; it is the default backend when using Jupyter. The outputs of plotting commands are displayed *inline* within frontends like Jupyter Notebook, directly below the code cells that produced them. The resulting plots will then also be stored in the notebook document.
  - The `notebook` or `nbagg` backend is built into `matplotlib` and can be used with Jupyter `notebook <7` and `nbclassic`. Plots are interactive so they can be zoomed and panned.
  - The `ipympl` or `widget` backend is for use with Jupyter `lab` and `notebook >=7`. It is in a separate `ipympl` module that must be installed using `pip` or `conda` in the usual manner. Plots are interactive so they can be zoomed and panned.

# Python vs IPython

This document is meant to highlight the main differences between the Python language and what are the specific constructs you can do only in IPython.

Unless expressed otherwise all of the constructs you will see here will raise a `SyntaxError` if run in a pure Python shell, or if executing in a Python script.

Each of these features is described more in detail in the further parts of the documentation.

## Quick overview:

All the following constructs are valid IPython syntax:

`` `ipython     In [1]: ?  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: ?object   .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: object?  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: *pattern*?  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: %shell like --syntax  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: !ls  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: my_files = !ls ~/     In [1]: for i, file in enumerate(my_files):        ...:     raw = !echo $file        ...:     !echo {file[0].upper()} $raw   .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: %%perl magic --function        ...: @months = ("July", "August", "September");        ...: print $months[0];   Each of these constructs is compiled by IPython into valid python code and will ``\` do most of the time what you expect it will do. Let's see each of these examples in more detail.

## Accessing help

As IPython is mostly an interactive shell, the question mark is a simple shortcut to get help. A question mark alone will bring up the IPython help:

`` `ipython     In [1]: ?      IPython -- An enhanced Interactive Python     =========================================      IPython offers a combination of convenient shell features, special commands     and a history mechanism for both input (command history) and output (results     caching, similar to Mathematica). It is intended to be a fully compatible     replacement for the standard Python interpreter, while offering vastly     improved functionality and flexibility.      At your system command line, type 'ipython -h' to see the command line     options available. This document only describes interactive features.      MAIN FEATURES     -------------     ...  A single question mark before or after an object available in the current ``\` namespace will show help relative to this object:

`` `ipython     In [6]: object?     Docstring: The most base type     Type:      type   A double question mark will try to pull out more information about the object, ``\` and if possible display the python source code of this object.

`` `ipython     In[1]: import collections     In[2]: collections.Counter??      Init signature: collections.Counter(*args, **kwds)     Source:     class Counter(dict):         '''Dict subclass for counting hashable items.  Sometimes called a bag         or multiset.  Elements are stored as dictionary keys and their counts         are stored as dictionary values.          >>> c = Counter('abcdeabcdabcaba')  # count elements from a string          >>> c.most_common(3)                # three most common elements         [('a', 5), ('b', 4), ('c', 3)]         >>> sorted(c)                       # list all unique elements         ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']         >>> ''.join(sorted(c.elements()))   # list elements with repetitions         'aaaaabbbbcccdde'         ...    If you are looking for an object, the use of wildcards ``\*`in conjunction`\` with a question mark will allow you to search the current namespace for objects with matching names:

`` `ipython     In [24]: *int*?     FloatingPointError     int     print   Shell Assignment ``\` ================

When doing interactive computing it is a common need to access the underlying shell. This is doable through the use of the exclamation mark `!` (or bang).

This allows to execute simple commands when present in beginning of the line:

`` `ipython     In[1]: !pwd     /User/home/  Change directory:  .. code-block:: ipython      In[1]: !cd /var/etc  Or edit file:  .. code-block:: ipython      In[1]: !mvim myfile.txt   The line after the bang can call any program installed in the underlying ``<span class="title-ref"> shell, and support variable expansion in the form of </span><span class="title-ref">$variable</span><span class="title-ref"> or </span><span class="title-ref">{variable}</span>\`. The later form of expansion supports arbitrary python expressions:

`` `ipython     In[1]: file = 'myfile.txt'      In[2]: !mv $file {file.upper()}   The bang ( ``\!`) can also be present on the right hand side of an assignment, just`\` after the equal sign, or separated from it by a white space. In this case the standard output of the command after the bang will be split out into lines in a list-like object and assigned to the left hand side.

This allows you, for example, to put the list of files of the current working directory in a variable:

`` `ipython     In[1]: my_files = !ls   You can combine the different possibilities in for loops, conditions, functions...:  .. code-block:: ipython      my_files = !ls ~/     for i, file in enumerate(my_files):         raw = !echo $backup $file         !cp $file {file.split('.')[0] + '.bak'}   Magics ``\` ------

Magic functions (magics) are often present in the form of shell-like syntax, but they are python functions under the hood. The syntax and assignment possibilities are similar to the one with the bang (`!`) syntax, but with more flexibility and power. Magic functions start with a percent sign (`%`) or double percent signs (`%%`).

A magic call with a single percent sign will act only on one line:

`` `ipython     In[1]: %xmode     Exception reporting mode: Verbose  Magics support assignment:  .. code-block:: ipython      In [1]: results = %timeit -r1 -n1 -o list(range(1000))     62.1 Âµs Â± 0 ns per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 1 run, 1 loop each)      In [2]: results     <TimeitResult : 62.1 Âµs Â± 0 ns per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 1 run, 1 loop each)>  Magics with double percent signs ( ``%%`) can spread over multiple lines, but they do not support assignments:  .. code-block:: ipython      In[1]: %%bash     ...  : echo "My shell is:" $SHELL     ...  : echo "My disk usage is:"     ...  : df -h     My shell is: /usr/local/bin/bash     My disk usage is:     Filesystem      Size   Used  Avail Capacity  iused   ifree %iused  Mounted on     /dev/disk1     233Gi  216Gi   16Gi    94% 56788108 4190706   93%   /     devfs          190Ki  190Ki    0Bi   100%      656       0  100%   /dev     map -hosts       0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /net     map auto_home    0Bi    0Bi    0Bi   100%        0       0  100%   /hom`\`

# IPython reference

## Command-line usage

You start IPython with the command:

    $ ipython [options] files

If invoked with no options, it executes the file and exits, passing the remaining arguments to the script, just as if you had specified the same command with python. You may need to specify <span class="title-ref">--</span> before args to be passed to the script, to prevent IPython from attempting to parse them. If you add the `-i` flag, it drops you into the interpreter while still acknowledging any options you may have set in your `ipython_config.py`. This behavior is different from standard Python, which when called as python `-i` will only execute one file and ignore your configuration setup.

Please note that some of the configuration options are not available at the command line, simply because they are not practical here. Look into your configuration files for details on those. There are separate configuration files for each profile, and the files look like `ipython_config.py` or `ipython_config_{frontendname}.py`. Profile directories look like `profile_{profilename}` and are typically installed in the `IPYTHONDIR` directory, which defaults to `$HOME/.ipython`. For Windows users, `HOME` resolves to `C:\\Users\\{YourUserName}` in most instances.

### Command-line Options

To see the options IPython accepts, use `ipython --help` (and you probably should run the output through a pager such as `ipython --help | less` for more convenient reading). This shows all the options that have a single-word alias to control them, but IPython lets you configure all of its objects from the command-line by passing the full class name and a corresponding value; type `ipython --help-all` to see this full list. For example:

    $ ipython --help-all
    <...snip...>
    --matplotlib=<CaselessStrEnum> (InteractiveShellApp.matplotlib)
        Default: None
        Choices: ['auto', 'gtk3', 'gtk4', 'inline', 'nbagg', 'notebook', 'osx', 'qt', 'qt5', 'qt6', 'tk', 'wx']
        Configure matplotlib for interactive use with the default matplotlib
        backend.
    <...snip...>

Indicate that the following:

    $ ipython --matplotlib qt

is equivalent to:

    $ ipython --InteractiveShellApp.matplotlib='qt'

Note that in the second form, you *must* use the equal sign, as the expression is evaluated as an actual Python assignment. While in the above example the short form is more convenient, only the most common options have a short form, while any configurable variable in IPython can be set at the command-line by using the long form. This long form is the same syntax used in the configuration files, if you want to set these options permanently.

## Interactive use

IPython is meant to work as a drop-in replacement for the standard interactive interpreter. As such, any code which is valid python should execute normally under IPython (cases where this is not true should be reported as bugs). It does, however, offer many features which are not available at a standard python prompt. What follows is a list of these.

### Caution for Windows users

Windows, unfortunately, uses the `\` character as a path separator. This is a terrible choice, because `\` also represents the escape character in most modern programming languages, including Python. For this reason, using '/' character is recommended if you have problems with `\`. However, in Windows commands '/' flags options, so you can not use it for the root directory. This means that paths beginning at the root must be typed in a contrived manner like: `%copy \opt/foo/bar.txt \tmp`

### Magic command system

IPython will treat any line whose first character is a % as a special call to a 'magic' function. These allow you to control the behavior of IPython itself, plus a lot of system-type features. They are all prefixed with a % character, but parameters are given without parentheses or quotes.

Lines that begin with `%%` signal a *cell magic*: they take as arguments not only the rest of the current line, but all lines below them as well, in the current execution block. Cell magics can in fact make arbitrary modifications to the input they receive, which need not even be valid Python code at all. They receive the whole block as a single string.

As a line magic example, the `cd` magic works just like the OS command of the same name:

    In [8]: %cd
    /home/fperez

The following uses the builtin `timeit` in cell mode:

    In [10]: %%timeit x = range(10000)
        ...: min(x)
        ...: max(x)
        ...:
    518 Âµs Â± 4.39 Âµs per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

In this case, `x = range(10000)` is called as the line argument, and the block with `min(x)` and `max(x)` is called as the cell body. The `timeit` magic receives both.

If you have 'automagic' enabled (as it is by default), you don't need to type in the single `%` explicitly for line magics; IPython will scan its internal list of magic functions and call one if it exists. With automagic on you can then just type `cd mydir` to go to directory 'mydir':

    In [9]: cd mydir
    /home/fperez/mydir

Cell magics *always* require an explicit `%%` prefix, automagic calling only works for line magics.

The automagic system has the lowest possible precedence in name searches, so you can freely use variables with the same names as magic commands. If a magic command is 'shadowed' by a variable, you will need the explicit `%` prefix to use it:

``` ipython
In [1]: cd ipython     # %cd is called by automagic
/home/fperez/ipython

In [2]: cd=1       # now cd is just a variable

In [3]: cd ..      # and doesn't work as a function anymore
File "<ipython-input-3-9fedb3aff56c>", line 1
  cd ..
      ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

In [4]: %cd ..     # but %cd always works
/home/fperez

In [5]: del cd     # if you remove the cd variable, automagic works again

In [6]: cd ipython

/home/fperez/ipython
```

Line magics, if they return a value, can be assigned to a variable using the syntax `l = %sx ls` (which in this particular case returns the result of <span class="title-ref">ls</span> as a python list). See \[below \<manual\_capture\>\](\#below-\<manual\_capture\>) for more information.

Type `%magic` for more information, including a list of all available magic functions at any time and their docstrings. You can also type `%magic_function_name?` (see \[below \<dynamic\_object\_info\>\](\#below-\<dynamic\_object\_info\>) for information on the '?' system) to get information about any particular magic function you are interested in.

The API documentation for the `IPython.core.magic` module contains the full docstrings of all currently available magic commands.

### Access to the standard Python help

Simply type `help()` to access Python's standard help system. You can also type `help(object)` for information about a given object, or `help('keyword')` for information on a keyword. You may need to configure your PYTHONDOCS environment variable for this feature to work correctly.

### Dynamic object information

Typing `?word` or `word?` prints detailed information about an object. If certain strings in the object are too long (e.g. function signatures) they get snipped in the center for brevity. This system gives access variable types and values, docstrings, function prototypes and other useful information.

If the information will not fit in the terminal, it is displayed in a pager (`less` if available, otherwise a basic internal pager).

Typing `??word` or `word??` gives access to the full information, including the source code where possible. Long strings are not snipped.

The following magic functions are particularly useful for gathering information about your working environment:

>   - `pdoc` **\<object\>**: Print (or run through a pager if too long) the docstring for an object. If the given object is a class, it will print both the class and the constructor docstrings.
>   - `pdef` **\<object\>**: Print the call signature for any callable object. If the object is a class, print the constructor information.
>   - `psource` **\<object\>**: Print (or run through a pager if too long) the source code for an object.
>   - `pfile` **\<object\>**: Show the entire source file where an object was defined via a pager, opening it at the line where the object definition begins.
>   - `who`/`whos`: These functions give information about identifiers you have defined interactively (not things you loaded or defined in your configuration files). %who just prints a list of identifiers and %whos prints a table with some basic details about each identifier.

The dynamic object information functions (?/??, `%pdoc`, `%pfile`, `%pdef`, `%psource`) work on object attributes, as well as directly on variables. For example, after doing `import os`, you can use `os.path.abspath??`.

#### Command line completion

At any time, hitting TAB will complete any available python commands or variable names, and show you a list of the possible completions if there's no unambiguous one. It will also complete filenames in the current directory if no python names match what you've typed so far.

#### Search command history

IPython provides two ways for searching through previous input and thus reduce the need for repetitive typing:

> 1.  Start typing, and then use the up and down arrow keys (or `Ctrl-p` and `Ctrl-n`) to search through only the history items that match what you've typed so far.
> 2.  Hit `Ctrl-r`: to open a search prompt. Begin typing and the system searches your history for lines that contain what you've typed so far, completing as much as it can.

IPython will save your input history when it leaves and reload it next time you restart it. By default, the history file is named `.ipython/profile_{name}/history.sqlite`.

#### Autoindent

Starting with 5.0, IPython uses <span class="title-ref">prompt\_toolkit</span> in place of `readline`, it thus can recognize lines ending in ':' and indent the next line, while also un-indenting automatically after 'raise' or 'return', and support real multi-line editing as well as syntactic coloration during edition.

This feature does not use the `readline` library anymore, so it will not honor your `~/.inputrc` configuration (or whatever file your `INPUTRC` environment variable points to).

In particular if you want to change the input mode to `vi`, you will need to set the `TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode` configuration option of IPython.

### Session logging and restoring

You can log all input from a session either by starting IPython with the command line switch `--logfile=foo.py` (see \[here \<command\_line\_options\>\](\#here-\<command\_line\_options\>)) or by activating the logging at any moment with the magic function `logstart`.

Log files can later be reloaded by running them as scripts and IPython will attempt to 'replay' the log by executing all the lines in it, thus restoring the state of a previous session. This feature is not quite perfect, but can still be useful in many cases.

The log files can also be used as a way to have a permanent record of any code you wrote while experimenting. Log files are regular text files which you can later open in your favorite text editor to extract code or to 'clean them up' before using them to replay a session.

The `logstart` function for activating logging in mid-session is used as follows:

    %logstart [log_name [log_mode]]

If no name is given, it defaults to a file named 'ipython\_log.py' in your current working directory, in 'rotate' mode (see below).

'%logstart name' saves to file 'name' in 'backup' mode. It saves your history up to that point and then continues logging.

%logstart takes a second optional parameter: logging mode. This can be one of (note that the modes are given unquoted):

>   - \[over:\] overwrite existing log\_name.
>   - \[backup:\] rename (if exists) to log\_name\~ and start log\_name.
>   - \[append:\] well, that says it.
>   - \[rotate:\] create rotating logs log\_name.1\~, log\_name.2\~, etc.

Adding the '-o' flag to '%logstart' magic (as in '%logstart -o \[log\_name \[log\_mode\]\]') will also include output from iPython in the log file.

The `logoff` and `logon` functions allow you to temporarily stop and resume logging to a file which had previously been started with %logstart. They will fail (with an explanation) if you try to use them before logging has been started.

### System shell access

Any input line beginning with a `!` character is passed verbatim (minus the `!`, of course) to the underlying operating system. For example, typing `!ls` will run 'ls' in the current directory.

### Manual capture of command output and magic output

You can assign the result of a system command to a Python variable with the syntax `myfiles = !ls`. Similarly, the result of a magic (as long as it returns a value) can be assigned to a variable. For example, the syntax `myfiles = %sx ls` is equivalent to the above system command example (the `sx` magic runs a shell command and captures the output). Each of these gets machine readable output from stdout (e.g. without colours), and splits on newlines. To explicitly get this sort of output without assigning to a variable, use two exclamation marks (`!!ls`) or the `sx` magic command without an assignment. (However, `!!` commands cannot be assigned to a variable.)

The captured list in this example has some convenience features. `myfiles.n` or `myfiles.s` returns a string delimited by newlines or spaces, respectively. `myfiles.p` produces [path objects](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/path.py) from the list items. See \[string\_lists\](\#string\_lists) for details.

IPython also allows you to expand the value of python variables when making system calls. Wrap variables or expressions in {braces}:

    In [1]: pyvar = 'Hello world'
    In [2]: !echo "A python variable: {pyvar}"
    A python variable: Hello world
    In [3]: import math
    In [4]: x = 8
    In [5]: !echo {math.factorial(x)}
    40320

For simple cases, you can alternatively prepend $ to a variable name:

    In [6]: !echo $sys.argv
    [/home/fperez/usr/bin/ipython]
    In [7]: !echo "A system variable: $$HOME"  # Use $$ for literal $
    A system variable: /home/fperez

Note that <span class="title-ref">$$</span> is used to represent a literal <span class="title-ref">$</span>.

### System command aliases

The `alias` magic function allows you to define magic functions which are in fact system shell commands. These aliases can have parameters.

`%alias alias_name cmd` defines 'alias\_name' as an alias for 'cmd'

Then, typing `alias_name params` will execute the system command 'cmd params' (from your underlying operating system).

You can also define aliases with parameters using `%s` specifiers (one per parameter). The following example defines the parts function as an alias to the command `echo first %s second %s` where each `%s` will be replaced by a positional parameter to the call to %parts:

    In [1]: %alias parts echo first %s second %s
    In [2]: parts A B
    first A second B
    In [3]: parts A
    ERROR: Alias <parts> requires 2 arguments, 1 given.

If called with no parameters, `alias` prints the table of currently defined aliases.

The `rehashx` magic allows you to load your entire $PATH as ipython aliases. See its docstring for further details.

### Recursive reload

The `IPython.lib.deepreload` module allows you to recursively reload a module: changes made to any of its dependencies will be reloaded without having to exit. To start using it, do:

    from IPython.lib.deepreload import reload as dreload

### Verbose and colored exception traceback printouts

IPython provides the option to see very detailed exception tracebacks, which can be especially useful when debugging large programs. You can run any Python file with the %run function to benefit from these detailed tracebacks. Furthermore, both normal and verbose tracebacks can be colored (if your terminal supports it) which makes them much easier to parse visually.

See the magic `xmode` and `colors` functions for details.

These features are basically a terminal version of Ka-Ping Yee's cgitb module, now part of the standard Python library.

### Input caching system

IPython offers numbered prompts (In/Out) with input and output caching (also referred to as 'input history'). All input is saved and can be retrieved as variables (besides the usual arrow key recall), in addition to the `rep` magic command that brings a history entry up for editing on the next command line.

The following variables always exist:

  - `_i`, `_ii`, `_iii`: store previous, next previous and next-next previous inputs.
  - `In`, `_ih` : a list of all inputs; `_ih[n]` is the input from line `n`. If you overwrite In with a variable of your own, you can remake the assignment to the internal list with a simple `In=_ih`.

Additionally, global variables named `_i<n>` are dynamically created (`<n>` being the prompt counter), so `_i<n> == _ih[<n>] == In[<n>]`.

For example, what you typed at prompt 14 is available as `_i14`, `_ih[14]` and `In[14]`.

This allows you to easily cut and paste multi line interactive prompts by printing them out: they print like a clean string, without prompt characters. You can also manipulate them like regular variables (they are strings), modify or exec them.

You can also re-execute multiple lines of input easily by using the magic `rerun` or `macro` functions. The macro system also allows you to re-execute previous lines which include magic function calls (which require special processing). Type %macro? for more details on the macro system.

A history function `history` allows you to see any part of your input history by printing a range of the \_i variables.

You can also search ('grep') through your history by typing `%hist -g somestring`. This is handy for searching for URLs, IP addresses, etc. You can bring history entries listed by '%hist -g' up for editing with the %recall command, or run them immediately with `rerun`.

### Output caching system

For output that is returned from actions, a system similar to the input cache exists but using \_ instead of \_i. Only actions that produce a result (NOT assignments, for example) are cached. If you are familiar with Mathematica, IPython's \_ variables behave exactly like Mathematica's % variables.

The following variables always exist:

>   - \[\_\] (a single underscore): stores previous output, like Python's default interpreter.
>   - \[\_\_\] (two underscores): next previous.
>   - \[\_\_\_\] (three underscores): next-next previous.

Additionally, global variables named \_\<n\> are dynamically created (\<n\> being the prompt counter), such that the result of output \<n\> is always available as \_\<n\> (don't use the angle brackets, just the number, e.g. `_21`).

These variables are also stored in a global dictionary (not a list, since it only has entries for lines which returned a result) available under the names \_oh and Out (similar to \_ih and In). So the output from line 12 can be obtained as `_12`, `Out[12]` or `_oh[12]`. If you accidentally overwrite the Out variable you can recover it by typing `Out=_oh` at the prompt.

This system obviously can potentially put heavy memory demands on your system, since it prevents Python's garbage collector from removing any previously computed results. You can control how many results are kept in memory with the configuration option `InteractiveShell.cache_size`. If you set it to 0, output caching is disabled. You can also use the `reset` and `xdel` magics to clear large items from memory.

### Directory history

Your history of visited directories is kept in the global list \_dh, and the magic `cd` command can be used to go to any entry in that list. The `dhist` command allows you to view this history. Do `cd -<TAB>` to conveniently view the directory history.

### Automatic parentheses and quotes

These features were adapted from Nathan Gray's LazyPython. They are meant to allow less typing for common situations.

Callable objects (i.e. functions, methods, etc) can be invoked like this (notice the commas between the arguments):

    In [1]: callable_ob arg1, arg2, arg3
    ------> callable_ob(arg1, arg2, arg3)

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

This feature is disabled by default. To enable it, use the `%autocall` magic command. The commands below with special prefixes will always work, however.

</div>

You can force automatic parentheses by using '/' as the first character of a line. For example:

    In [2]: /globals # becomes 'globals()'

Note that the '/' MUST be the first character on the line\! This won't work:

    In [3]: print /globals # syntax error

In most cases the automatic algorithm should work, so you should rarely need to explicitly invoke /. One notable exception is if you are trying to call a function with a list of tuples as arguments (the parenthesis will confuse IPython):

    In [4]: zip (1,2,3),(4,5,6) # won't work

but this will work:

    In [5]: /zip (1,2,3),(4,5,6)
    ------> zip ((1,2,3),(4,5,6))
    Out[5]: [(1, 4), (2, 5), (3, 6)]

IPython tells you that it has altered your command line by displaying the new command line preceded by `--->`.

You can force automatic quoting of a function's arguments by using `,` or `;` as the first character of a line. For example:

    In [1]: ,my_function /home/me  # becomes my_function("/home/me")

If you use ';' the whole argument is quoted as a single string, while ',' splits on whitespace:

    In [2]: ,my_function a b c    # becomes my_function("a","b","c")
    
    In [3]: ;my_function a b c    # becomes my_function("a b c")

Note that the ',' or ';' MUST be the first character on the line\! This won't work:

    In [4]: x = ,my_function /home/me # syntax error

## IPython as your default Python environment

Python honors the environment variable `PYTHONSTARTUP` and will execute at startup the file referenced by this variable. If you put the following code at the end of that file, then IPython will be your working environment anytime you start Python:

    import os, IPython
    os.environ['PYTHONSTARTUP'] = ''  # Prevent running this again
    IPython.start_ipython()
    raise SystemExit

The `raise SystemExit` is needed to exit Python when it finishes, otherwise you'll be back at the normal Python `>>>` prompt.

This is probably useful to developers who manage multiple Python versions and don't want to have correspondingly multiple IPython versions. Note that in this mode, there is no way to pass IPython any command-line options, as those are trapped first by Python itself.

## Embedding IPython

You can start a regular IPython session with

``` python
import IPython
IPython.start_ipython(argv=[])
```

at any point in your program. This will load IPython configuration, startup files, and everything, just as if it were a normal IPython session. For information on setting configuration options when running IPython from python, see \[configure\_start\_ipython\](\#configure\_start\_ipython).

It is also possible to embed an IPython shell in a namespace in your Python code. This allows you to evaluate dynamically the state of your code, operate with your variables, analyze them, etc. For example, if you run the following code snippet:

    import IPython
    
    a = 42
    IPython.embed()

and within the IPython shell, you reassign <span class="title-ref">a</span> to <span class="title-ref">23</span> to do further testing of some sort, you can then exit:

    >>> IPython.embed()
    Python 3.6.2 (default, Jul 17 2017, 16:44:45)
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 6.2.0.dev -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
    
    In [1]: a = 23
    
    In [2]: exit()

Once you exit and print <span class="title-ref">a</span>, the value 23 will be shown:

    In: print(a)
    23

It's important to note that the code run in the embedded IPython shell will *not* change the state of your code and variables, **unless** the shell is contained within the global namespace. In the above example, <span class="title-ref">a</span> is changed because this is true.

To further exemplify this, consider the following example:

    import IPython
    def do():
        a = 42
        print(a)
        IPython.embed()
        print(a)

Now if call the function and complete the state changes as we did above, the value <span class="title-ref">42</span> will be printed. Again, this is because it's not in the global namespace:

    do()

Running a file with the above code can lead to the following session:

    >>> do()
    42
    Python 3.6.2 (default, Jul 17 2017, 16:44:45)
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 6.2.0.dev -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
    
    In [1]: a = 23
    
    In [2]: exit()
    42

\> **Note** \> At present, embedding IPython cannot be done from inside IPython. Run the code samples below outside IPython.

This feature allows you to easily have a fully functional python environment for doing object introspection anywhere in your code with a simple function call. In some cases a simple print statement is enough, but if you need to do more detailed analysis of a code fragment this feature can be very valuable.

It can also be useful in scientific computing situations where it is common to need to do some automatic, computationally intensive part and then stop to look at data, plots, etc. Opening an IPython instance will give you full access to your data and functions, and you can resume program execution once you are done with the interactive part (perhaps to stop again later, as many times as needed).

The following code snippet is the bare minimum you need to include in your Python programs for this to work (detailed examples follow later):

    from IPython import embed
    
    embed() # this call anywhere in your program will start IPython

You can also embed an IPython *kernel*, for use with qtconsole, etc. via `IPython.embed_kernel()`. This should work the same way, but you can connect an external frontend (`ipython qtconsole` or `ipython console`), rather than interacting with it in the terminal.

You can run embedded instances even in code which is itself being run at the IPython interactive prompt with '%run \<filename\>'. Since it's easy to get lost as to where you are (in your top-level IPython or in your embedded one), it's a good idea in such cases to set the in/out prompts to something different for the embedded instances. The code examples below illustrate this.

You can also have multiple IPython instances in your program and open them separately, for example with different options for data presentation. If you close and open the same instance multiple times, its prompt counters simply continue from each execution to the next.

Please look at the docstrings in the `~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed` module for more details on the use of this system.

The following sample file illustrating how to use the embedding functionality is provided in the examples directory as embed\_class\_long.py. It should be fairly self-explanatory:

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="python">

../../../examples/Embedding/embed\_class\_long.py

</div>

Once you understand how the system functions, you can use the following code fragments in your programs which are ready for cut and paste:

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="python">

../../../examples/Embedding/embed\_class\_short.py

</div>

## Using the Python debugger (pdb)

### Running entire programs via pdb

pdb, the Python debugger, is a powerful interactive debugger which allows you to step through code, set breakpoints, watch variables, etc. IPython makes it very easy to start any script under the control of pdb, regardless of whether you have wrapped it into a 'main()' function or not. For this, simply type `%run -d myscript` at an IPython prompt. See the `run` command's documentation for more details, including how to control where pdb will stop execution first.

For more information on the use of the pdb debugger, see \[debugger-commands\](\#debugger-commands) in the Python documentation.

IPython extends the debugger with a few useful additions, like coloring of tracebacks. The debugger will adopt the color scheme selected for IPython.

The `where` command has also been extended to take as argument the number of context line to show. This allows to a many line of context on shallow stack trace:

    In [5]: def foo(x):
    ...:     1
    ...:     2
    ...:     3
    ...:     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
    ...:     5
    ...:     6
    ...:     7
    ...:
    
    In[6]: foo(1)
    # ...
    ipdb> where 8
    <ipython-input-6-9e45007b2b59>(1)<module>
    ----> 1 foo(1)
    
    <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
        1 def foo(x):
        2     1
        3     2
        4     3
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
        6     5
        7     6
        8     7
    
    > <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
        1 def foo(x):
        2     1
        3     2
        4     3
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
        6     5
        7     6
        8     7

And less context on shallower Stack Trace:

    ipdb> where 1
    <ipython-input-13-afa180a57233>(1)<module>
    ----> 1 foo(7)
    
    <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
    
    <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
    
    <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)
    
    <ipython-input-5-7baadc3d1465>(5)foo()
    ----> 5     return 1/x+foo(x-1)

### Post-mortem debugging

Going into a debugger when an exception occurs can be extremely useful in order to find the origin of subtle bugs, because pdb opens up at the point in your code which triggered the exception, and while your program is at this point 'dead', all the data is still available and you can walk up and down the stack frame and understand the origin of the problem.

You can use the `debug` magic after an exception has occurred to start post-mortem debugging. IPython can also call debugger every time your code triggers an uncaught exception. This feature can be toggled with the `pdb` magic command, or you can start IPython with the `--pdb` option.

For a post-mortem debugger in your programs outside IPython, put the following lines toward the top of your 'main' routine:

    import sys
    from IPython.core import ultratb
    sys.excepthook = ultratb.FormattedTB(mode='Verbose',
    color_scheme='Linux', call_pdb=1)

The mode keyword can be either 'Verbose' or 'Plain', giving either very detailed or normal tracebacks respectively. The color\_scheme keyword can be one of 'NoColor', 'Linux' (default) or 'LightBG'. These are the same options which can be set in IPython with `--colors` and `--xmode`.

This will give any of your programs detailed, colored tracebacks with automatic invocation of pdb.

## Pasting of code starting with Python or IPython prompts

IPython is smart enough to filter out input prompts, be they plain Python ones (`>>>` and `...`) or IPython ones (`In [N]:` and `...:`). You can therefore copy and paste from existing interactive sessions without worry.

The following is a 'screenshot' of how things work, copying an example from the standard Python tutorial:

    In [1]: >>> # Fibonacci series:
    
    In [2]: ... # the sum of two elements defines the next
    
    In [3]: ... a, b = 0, 1
    
    In [4]: >>> while b < 10:
       ...:     ...     print(b)
       ...:     ...     a, b = b, a+b
       ...:
    1
    1
    2
    3
    5
    8

And pasting from IPython sessions works equally well:

    In [1]: In [5]: def f(x):
       ...:        ...:     "A simple function"
       ...:        ...:     return x**2
       ...:    ...:
    
    In [2]: f(3)
    Out[2]: 9

## GUI event loop support

IPython has excellent support for working interactively with Graphical User Interface (GUI) toolkits, such as wxPython, PyQt/PySide, PyGTK and Tk. This is implemented by running the toolkit's event loop while IPython is waiting for input.

For users, enabling GUI event loop integration is simple. You simple use the `gui` magic as follows:

    %gui [GUINAME]

With no arguments, `%gui` removes all GUI support. Valid `GUINAME` arguments include `wx`, `qt`, `qt5`, `qt6`, `gtk3` `gtk4`, and `tk`.

Thus, to use wxPython interactively and create a running <span class="title-ref">wx.App</span> object, do:

    %gui wx

You can also start IPython with an event loop set up using the <span class="title-ref">--gui</span> flag:

    $ ipython --gui=qt

For information on IPython's [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) integration (and the `matplotlib` mode) see \[this section \<matplotlib\_support\>\](\#this-section-\<matplotlib\_support\>).

For developers that want to integrate additional event loops with IPython, see \[/config/eventloops\](/config/eventloops.md).

When running inside IPython with an integrated event loop, a GUI application should *not* start its own event loop. This means that applications that are meant to be used both in IPython and as standalone apps need to have special code to detects how the application is being run. We highly recommend using IPython's support for this. Since the details vary slightly between toolkits, we point you to the various examples in our source directory `examples/IPython Kernel/gui/` that demonstrate these capabilities.

### PyQt and PySide

When you use `--gui=qt` or `--matplotlib=qt`, IPython can work with either PyQt or PySide. `qt` implies "use the latest version available", and it favors PyQt over PySide. To request a specific version, use `qt5` or `qt6`.

If specified, IPython will respect the environment variable `QT_API`. If `QT_API` is not specified and you launch IPython in matplotlib mode with `ipython --matplotlib=qt` then IPython will ask matplotlib which Qt library to use. See the [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) documentation on `QT_API` for further details.

## Plotting with matplotlib

[matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) provides high quality 2D and 3D plotting for Python. [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org) can produce plots on screen using a variety of GUI toolkits, including Tk, PyGTK, PyQt6 and wxPython. It also provides a number of commands useful for scientific computing, all with a syntax compatible with that of the popular Matlab program.

To start IPython with matplotlib support, use the `--matplotlib` switch. If IPython is already running, you can run the `matplotlib` magic. If no arguments are given, IPython will automatically detect your choice of matplotlib backend. For information on matplotlib backends see \[matplotlib\_magic\](\#matplotlib\_magic).

## Interactive demos with IPython

IPython ships with a basic system for running scripts interactively in sections, useful when presenting code to audiences. A few tags embedded in comments (so that the script remains valid Python code) divide a file into separate blocks, and the demo can be run one block at a time, with IPython printing (with syntax highlighting) the block before executing it, and returning to the interactive prompt after each block. The interactive namespace is updated after each block is run with the contents of the demo's namespace.

This allows you to show a piece of code, run it and then execute interactively commands based on the variables just created. Once you want to continue, you simply execute the next block of the demo. The following listing shows the markup necessary for dividing a script into sections for execution as a demo:

<div class="literalinclude" data-language="python">

../../../examples/IPython Kernel/example-demo.py

</div>

In order to run a file as a demo, you must first make a Demo object out of it. If the file is named myscript.py, the following code will make a demo:

    from IPython.lib.demo import Demo
    
    mydemo = Demo('myscript.py')

This creates the mydemo object, whose blocks you run one at a time by simply calling the object with no arguments. Then call it to run each step of the demo:

    mydemo()

Demo objects can be restarted, you can move forward or back skipping blocks, re-execute the last block, etc. See the `IPython.lib.demo` module and the <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.lib.demo.Demo</span> class for details.

Limitations: These demos are limited to fairly simple uses. In particular, you cannot break up sections within indented code (loops, if statements, function definitions, etc.) Supporting something like this would basically require tracking the internal execution state of the Python interpreter, so only top-level divisions are allowed. If you want to be able to open an IPython instance at an arbitrary point in a program, you can use IPython's \[embedding facilities \<Embedding\>\](\#embedding-facilities-\<embedding\>).

# IPython as a system shell

## Overview

It is possible to adapt IPython for system shell usage. In the past, IPython shipped a special 'sh' profile for this purpose, but it had been quarantined since 0.11 release, and in 1.0 it was removed altogether. Nevertheless, much of this section relies on machinery which does not require a custom profile.

You can set up your own 'sh' \[profile \<Profiles\>\](\#profile-\<profiles\>) to be different from the default profile such that:

>   - Prompt shows the current directory (see [Prompt customization](#prompt-customization))
>   - Make system commands directly available (in alias table) by running the `%rehashx` magic. If you install new programs along your PATH, you might want to run `%rehashx` to update the alias table
>   - turn `%autocall` to full mode

## Environment variables

Rather than manipulating os.environ directly, you may like to use the magic <span class="title-ref">%env</span> command. With no arguments, this displays all environment variables and values. To get the value of a specific variable, use <span class="title-ref">%env var</span>. To set the value of a specific variable, use <span class="title-ref">%env foo bar</span>, <span class="title-ref">%env foo=bar</span>. By default values are considered to be strings so quoting them is unnecessary. However, Python variables are expanded as usual in the magic command, so <span class="title-ref">%env foo=$bar</span> means "set the environment variable foo to the value of the Python variable <span class="title-ref">bar</span>".

## Aliases

Once you run `%rehashx`, all of your $PATH has been loaded as IPython aliases, so you should be able to type any normal system command and have it executed. See `%alias?` and `%unalias?` for details on the alias facilities. See also `%rehashx?` for details on the mechanism used to load $PATH.

\> **Warning** \> See info at the top of the page. You most likely want to use [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/) instead of this.

## Directory management

Since each command passed by IPython to the underlying system is executed in a subshell which exits immediately, you can NOT use \!cd to navigate the filesystem.

IPython provides its own builtin `%cd` magic command to move in the filesystem (the % is not required with automagic on). It also maintains a list of visited directories (use `%dhist` to see it) and allows direct switching to any of them. Type `cd?` for more details.

`%pushd`, `%popd` and `%dirs` are provided for directory stack handling.

## Prompt customization

See \[custom\_prompts\](\#custom\_prompts).

## String lists

String lists (IPython.utils.text.SList) are handy way to process output from system commands. They are produced by `var = !cmd` syntax.

First, we acquire the output of 'ls -l':

    [Q:doc/examples]|2> lines = !ls -l
     ==
    ['total 23',
     '-rw-rw-rw- 1 ville None 1163 Sep 30  2006 example-demo.py',
     '-rw-rw-rw- 1 ville None 1927 Sep 30  2006 example-embed-short.py',
     '-rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None 4606 Sep  1 17:15 example-embed.py',
     '-rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None 1017 Sep 30  2006 example-gnuplot.py',
     '-rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  339 Jun 11 18:01 extension.py',
     '-rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  113 Dec 20  2006 seteditor.py',
     '-rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  245 Dec 12  2006 seteditor.pyc']

Now, let's take a look at the contents of 'lines' (the first number is the list element number):

    [Q:doc/examples]|3> lines
                    <3> SList (.p, .n, .l, .s, .grep(), .fields() available). Value:
    
    0: total 23
    1: -rw-rw-rw- 1 ville None 1163 Sep 30  2006 example-demo.py
    2: -rw-rw-rw- 1 ville None 1927 Sep 30  2006 example-embed-short.py
    3: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None 4606 Sep  1 17:15 example-embed.py
    4: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None 1017 Sep 30  2006 example-gnuplot.py
    5: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  339 Jun 11 18:01 extension.py
    6: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  113 Dec 20  2006 seteditor.py
    7: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  245 Dec 12  2006 seteditor.pyc

Now, let's filter out the 'embed' lines:

    [Q:doc/examples]|4> l2 = lines.grep('embed',prune=1)
    [Q:doc/examples]|5> l2
                    <5> SList (.p, .n, .l, .s, .grep(), .fields() available). Value:
    
    0: total 23
    1: -rw-rw-rw- 1 ville None 1163 Sep 30  2006 example-demo.py
    2: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None 1017 Sep 30  2006 example-gnuplot.py
    3: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  339 Jun 11 18:01 extension.py
    4: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  113 Dec 20  2006 seteditor.py
    5: -rwxrwxrwx 1 ville None  245 Dec 12  2006 seteditor.pyc

Now, we want strings having just file names and permissions:

    [Q:doc/examples]|6> l2.fields(8,0)
                    <6> SList (.p, .n, .l, .s, .grep(), .fields() available). Value:
    
    0: total
    1: example-demo.py -rw-rw-rw-
    2: example-gnuplot.py -rwxrwxrwx
    3: extension.py -rwxrwxrwx
    4: seteditor.py -rwxrwxrwx
    5: seteditor.pyc -rwxrwxrwx

Note how the line with 'total' does not raise IndexError.

If you want to split these (yielding lists), call fields() without arguments:

    [Q:doc/examples]|7> _.fields()
                    <7>
    [['total'],
     ['example-demo.py', '-rw-rw-rw-'],
     ['example-gnuplot.py', '-rwxrwxrwx'],
     ['extension.py', '-rwxrwxrwx'],
     ['seteditor.py', '-rwxrwxrwx'],
     ['seteditor.pyc', '-rwxrwxrwx']]

If you want to pass these separated with spaces to a command (typical for lists if files), use the .s property:

    [Q:doc/examples]|13> files = l2.fields(8).s
    [Q:doc/examples]|14> files
                    <14> 'example-demo.py example-gnuplot.py extension.py seteditor.py seteditor.pyc'
    [Q:doc/examples]|15> ls $files
    example-demo.py  example-gnuplot.py  extension.py  seteditor.py  seteditor.pyc

SLists are inherited from normal Python lists, so every list method is available:

    [Q:doc/examples]|21> lines.append('hey')

### Real world example: remove all files outside version control

First, capture output of "hg status":

    [Q:/ipython]|28> out = !hg status
     ==
    ['M IPython\\extensions\\ipy_kitcfg.py',
     'M IPython\\extensions\\ipy_rehashdir.py',
    ...
     '? build\\lib\\IPython\\Debugger.py',
     '? build\\lib\\IPython\\extensions\\InterpreterExec.py',
     '? build\\lib\\IPython\\extensions\\InterpreterPasteInput.py',
    ...

(lines starting with ? are not under version control).

    [Q:/ipython]|35> junk = out.grep(r'^\?').fields(1)
    [Q:/ipython]|36> junk
                <36> SList (.p, .n, .l, .s, .grep(), .fields() availab
    ...
    10: build\bdist.win32\winexe\temp\_ctypes.py
    11: build\bdist.win32\winexe\temp\_hashlib.py
    12: build\bdist.win32\winexe\temp\_socket.py

Now we can just remove these files by doing 'rm $junk.s'.

### The .n, .s, .p properties

Properties of [SList](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/generated/IPython.utils.text.html?highlight=SList#IPython.utils.text.SList) wrapper provide a convenient ways to use contained text in different formats:

  - `.n` returns (original) string with lines separated by a newline
  - `.s` returns string with lines separated by single space (for convenient passing to system commands)
  - `.p` returns list of "path" objects from detected file names

<div class="error">

# IPython Tips & Tricks

The [IPython cookbook](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki?path=Cookbook) details more things you can do with IPython.

## Embed IPython in your programs

A few lines of code are enough to load a complete IPython inside your own programs, giving you the ability to work with your data interactively after automatic processing has been completed. See \[the embedding section \<embedding\>\](\#the-embedding-section-\<embedding\>).

## Run doctests

Run your doctests from within IPython for development and debugging. The special `%doctest_mode` command toggles a mode where the prompt, output and exceptions display matches as closely as possible that of the default Python interpreter. In addition, this mode allows you to directly paste in code that contains leading '\>\>\>' prompts, even if they have extra leading whitespace (as is common in doctest files). This combined with the `%hist -t` call to see your translated history allows for an easy doctest workflow, where you can go from doctest to interactive execution to pasting into valid Python code as needed.

## Use IPython to present interactive demos

Use the <span class="title-ref">IPython.lib.demo.Demo</span> class to load any Python script as an interactive demo. With a minimal amount of simple markup, you can control the execution of the script, stopping as needed. See \[here \<interactive\_demos\>\](\#here-\<interactive\_demos\>) for more.

## Suppress output

Put a ';' at the end of a line to suppress the printing of output. This is useful when doing calculations which generate long output you are not interested in seeing. It also keeps the object out of the output cache, so if you're working with large temporary objects, they'll be released from memory sooner.

## Lightweight 'version control'

When you call `%edit` with no arguments, IPython opens an empty editor with a temporary file, and it returns the contents of your editing session as a string variable. Thanks to IPython's output caching mechanism, this is automatically stored:

    In [1]: %edit
    
    IPython will make a temporary file named: /tmp/ipython_edit_yR-HCN.py
    
    Editing... done. Executing edited code...
    
    hello - this is a temporary file
    
    Out[1]: "print('hello - this is a temporary file')\n"

Now, if you call `%edit -p`, IPython tries to open an editor with the same data as the last time you used %edit. So if you haven't used %edit in the meantime, this same contents will reopen; however, it will be done in a new file. This means that if you make changes and you later want to find an old version, you can always retrieve it by using its output number, via '%edit \_NN', where NN is the number of the output prompt.

Continuing with the example above, this should illustrate this idea:

    In [2]: edit -p
    
    IPython will make a temporary file named: /tmp/ipython_edit_nA09Qk.py
    
    Editing... done. Executing edited code...
    
    hello - now I made some changes
    
    Out[2]: "print('hello - now I made some changes')\n"
    
    In [3]: edit _1
    
    IPython will make a temporary file named: /tmp/ipython_edit_gy6-zD.py
    
    Editing... done. Executing edited code...
    
    hello - this is a temporary file
    
    IPython version control at work :)
    
    Out[3]: "print('hello - this is a temporary file')\nprint('IPython version control at work :)')\n"

This section was written after a contribution by Alexander Belchenko on the IPython user list.

# Introducing IPython

You don't need to know anything beyond Python to start using IPython â just type commands as you would at the standard Python prompt. But IPython can do much more than the standard prompt. Some key features are described here. For more information, check the \[tips page \<tips\>\](\#tips-page-\<tips\>), or look at examples in the [IPython cookbook](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Cookbook%3A-Index).

If you haven't done that yet see \[how to install ipython \<install\>\](\#how-to-install-ipython-\<install\>).

If you've never used Python before, you might want to look at [the official tutorial](http://docs.python.org/tutorial/).

Start IPython by issuing the `ipython` command from your shell, you should be greeted by the following:

    Python 3.6.0
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 6.0.0.dev -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
    
    In [1]:

Unlike the Python REPL, you will see that the input prompt is `In [N]:` instead of `>>>`. The number `N` in the prompt will be used later in this tutorial but should usually not impact the computation.

You should be able to type single line expressions and press enter to evaluate them. If an expression is incomplete, IPython will automatically detect this and add a new line when you press `Enter` instead of executing right away.

Feel free to explore multi-line text input. Unlike many other REPLs, with IPython you can use the up and down arrow keys when editing multi-line code blocks.

Here is an example of a longer interaction with the IPython REPL, which we often refer to as an IPython *session* :

    In [1]: print('Hello IPython')
    Hello IPython
    
    In [2]: 21 * 2
    Out[2]: 42
    
    In [3]: def say_hello(name):
       ...:     print('Hello {name}'.format(name=name))
       ...:

We won't get into details right now, but you may notice a few differences to the standard Python REPL. First, your code should be syntax-highlighted as you type. Second, you will see that some results will have an `Out[N]:` prompt, while some other do not. We'll come to this later.

Depending on the exact command you are typing you might realize that sometimes `Enter` will add a new line, and sometimes it will execute the current statement. IPython tries to guess what you are doing, so most of the time you should not have to care. Though if by any chance IPython does not do the right thing you can force execution of the current code block by pressing in sequence `Esc` and `Enter`. You can also force the insertion of a new line at the position of the cursor by using `Ctrl-o`.

## The four most helpful commands

The four most helpful commands, as well as their brief description, is shown to you in a banner, every time you start IPython:

| command   | description                                               |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| ?         | Introduction and overview of IPython's features.          |
| %quickref | Quick reference.                                          |
| help      | Python's own help system.                                 |
| object?   | Details about 'object', use 'object??' for extra details. |

## Tab completion

Tab completion, especially for attributes, is a convenient way to explore the structure of any object you're dealing with. Simply type `object_name.<TAB>` to view the object's attributes. Besides Python objects and keywords, tab completion also works on file and directory names.

Starting with IPython 6.0, if `jedi` is installed, IPython will try to pull completions from Jedi as well. This allows to not only inspect currently existing objects, but also to infer completion statically without executing code. There is nothing particular needed to get this to work, simply use tab completion on more complex expressions like the following:

    >>> data = ['Number of users', 123456]
    ... data[0].<tab>

IPython and Jedi will be able to infer that `data[0]` is actually a string and should show relevant completions like `upper()`, `lower()` and other string methods. You can use the `Tab` key to cycle through completions, and while a completion is highlighted, its type will be shown as well. When the type of the completion is a function, the completer will also show the signature of the function when highlighted.

## Exploring your objects

Typing `object_name?` will print all sorts of details about any object, including docstrings, function definition lines (for call arguments) and constructor details for classes. To get specific information on an object, you can use the magic commands `%pdoc`, `%pdef`, `%psource` and `%pfile`

## Magic functions

IPython has a set of predefined 'magic functions' that you can call with a command line style syntax. There are two kinds of magics, line-oriented and cell-oriented. **Line magics** are prefixed with the `%` character and work much like OS command-line calls: they get as an argument the rest of the line, where arguments are passed without parentheses or quotes. **Line magics** can return results and can be used in the right hand side of an assignment. **Cell magics** are prefixed with a double `%%`, and they are functions that get as an argument not only the rest of the line, but also the lines below it in a separate argument.

Magics are useful as convenient functions where Python syntax is not the most natural one, or when one want to embed invalid python syntax in their work flow.

The following examples show how to call the built-in `timeit` magic, both in line and cell mode:

    In [1]: %timeit range(1000)
    179 ns Â± 2.66 ns per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 10000000 loops each)
    
    In [2]: %%timeit x = range(10000)
    ...: max(x)
    ...: 
    264 Âµs Â± 1 Âµs per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)

The built-in magics include:

  - Functions that work with code: `run`, `edit`, `save`, `macro`, `recall`, etc.
  - Functions which affect the shell: `colors`, `xmode`, `automagic`, etc.
  - Other functions such as `reset`, `timeit`, `writefile`, `load`, or `paste`.

You can always call magics using the `%` prefix, and if you're calling a line magic on a line by itself, as long as the identifier is not defined in your namespace, you can omit even that:

    run thescript.py

You can toggle this behavior by running the `automagic` magic. Cell magics must always have the `%%` prefix.

A more detailed explanation of the magic system can be obtained by calling `%magic`, and for more details on any magic function, call `%somemagic?` to read its docstring. To see all the available magic functions, call `%lsmagic`.

<div class="seealso">

The \[magic\](\#magic) section of the documentation goes more in depth into how the magics works and how to define your own, and \[magics\](magics.md) for a list of built-in magics.

</div>

### Running and Editing

The `run` magic command allows you to run any python script and load all of its data directly into the interactive namespace. Since the file is re-read from disk each time, changes you make to it are reflected immediately (unlike imported modules, which have to be specifically reloaded). IPython also includes \[dreload \<dreload\>\](\#dreload-\<dreload\>), a recursive reload function.

`%run` has special flags for timing the execution of your scripts (-t), or for running them under the control of either Python's pdb debugger (-d) or profiler (-p).

The `edit` command gives a reasonable approximation of multi-line editing, by invoking your favorite editor on the spot. IPython will execute the code you type in there as if it were typed interactively. Note that for `edit` to work, the call to startup your editor has to be a blocking call. In a GUI environment, your editor likely will have such an option.

### Debugging

After an exception occurs, you can call `debug` to jump into the Python debugger (pdb) and examine the problem. Alternatively, if you call `pdb`, IPython will automatically start the debugger on any uncaught exception. You can print variables, see code, execute statements and even walk up and down the call stack to track down the true source of the problem. This can be an efficient way to develop and debug code, in many cases eliminating the need for print statements or external debugging tools.

You can also step through a program from the beginning by calling `%run -d theprogram.py`.

## History

IPython stores both the commands you enter, and the results it produces. You can easily go through previous commands with the up- and down-arrow keys, or access your history in more sophisticated ways.

Input and output history are kept in variables called `In` and `Out`, keyed by the prompt numbers, e.g. `In[4]`. The last three objects in output history are also kept in variables named `_`, `__` and `___`.

You can use the `%history` magic function to examine past input and output. Input history from previous sessions is saved in a database, and IPython can be configured to save output history.

Several other magic functions can use your input history, including `%edit`, `%rerun`, `%recall`, `%macro`, `%save` and `%pastebin`. You can use a standard format to refer to lines:

    %pastebin 3 18-20 ~1/1-5

This will take line 3 and lines 18 to 20 from the current session, and lines 1-5 from the previous session.

## System shell commands

To run any command at the system shell, simply prefix it with `!`, e.g.:

    !ping www.bbc.co.uk

You can capture the output into a Python list, e.g.: `files = !ls`. To pass the values of Python variables or expressions to system commands, prefix them with $: `!grep -rF $pattern ipython/*` or wrap in <span class="title-ref">{braces}</span>. See \[our shell section \<system\_shell\_access\>\](\#our shell-section-\<system\_shell\_access\>) for more details.

### Define your own system aliases

It's convenient to have aliases to the system commands you use most often. This allows you to work seamlessly from inside IPython with the same commands you are used to in your system shell. IPython comes with some pre-defined aliases and a complete system for changing directories, both via a stack (see `pushd`, `popd` and `dhist`) and via direct `cd`. The latter keeps a history of visited directories and allows you to go to any previously visited one.

## Configuration

Much of IPython can be tweaked through \[configuration \</config/intro\>\](configuration \</config/intro\>.md). To get started, use the command `ipython profile create` to produce the default config files. These will be placed in `~/.ipython/profile_default`, and contain comments explaining what the various options do.

Profiles allow you to use IPython for different tasks, keeping separate config files and history for each one. More details in \[the profiles section \<profiles\>\](\#the-profiles-section \<profiles\>).

### Startup Files

If you want some code to be run at the beginning of every IPython session, the easiest way is to add Python (.py) or IPython (.ipy) scripts to your `profile_default/startup/` directory. Files here will be executed as soon as the IPython shell is constructed, before any other code or scripts you have specified. The files will be run in order of their names, so you can control the ordering with prefixes, like `10-myimports.py`.

# Overview

One of Python's most useful features is its interactive interpreter. It allows for very fast testing of ideas without the overhead of creating test files as is typical in most programming languages. However, the interpreter supplied with the standard Python distribution is somewhat limited for extended interactive use.

The goal of IPython is to create a comprehensive environment for interactive and exploratory computing. To support this goal, IPython has three main components:

  - An enhanced interactive Python shell.
  - A decoupled \[two-process communication model \<ipythonzmq\>\](\#two-process-communication-model-\<ipythonzmq\>), which allows for multiple clients to connect to a computation kernel, most notably the web-based notebook provided with [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org).
  - An architecture for interactive parallel computing now part of the <span class="title-ref">ipyparallel</span> package.

All of IPython is open source (released under the revised BSD license).

## Enhanced interactive Python shell

IPython's interactive shell (`ipython`), has the following goals, amongst others:

1.  Provide an interactive shell superior to Python's default. IPython has many features for tab-completion, object introspection, system shell access, command history retrieval across sessions, and its own special command system for adding functionality when working interactively. It tries to be a very efficient environment both for Python code development and for exploration of problems using Python objects (in situations like data analysis).
2.  Serve as an embeddable, ready to use interpreter for your own programs. An interactive IPython shell can be started with a single call from inside another program, providing access to the current namespace. This can be very useful both for debugging purposes and for situations where a blend of batch-processing and interactive exploration are needed.
3.  Offer a flexible framework which can be used as the base environment for working with other systems, with Python as the underlying bridge language. Specifically scientific environments like Mathematica, IDL and Matlab inspired its design, but similar ideas can be useful in many fields.
4.  Allow interactive testing of threaded graphical toolkits. IPython has support for interactive, non-blocking control of GTK, Qt, WX, GLUT, and OS X applications via special threading flags. The normal Python shell can only do this for Tkinter applications.

### Main features of the interactive shell

  - Dynamic object introspection. One can access docstrings, function definition prototypes, source code, source files and other details of any object accessible to the interpreter with a single keystroke (`?`, and using `??` provides additional detail).
  - Searching through modules and namespaces with `*` wildcards, both when using the `?` system and via the `%psearch` command.
  - Completion in the local namespace, by typing `TAB` at the prompt. This works for keywords, modules, methods, variables and files in the current directory. This is supported via the `prompt_toolkit` library. Custom completers can be implemented easily for different purposes (system commands, magic arguments etc.)
  - Numbered input/output prompts with command history (persistent across sessions and tied to each profile), full searching in this history and caching of all input and output.
  - User-extensible 'magic' commands. A set of commands prefixed with `%` or `%%` is available for controlling IPython itself and provides directory control, namespace information and many aliases to common system shell commands.
  - Alias facility for defining your own system aliases.
  - Complete system shell access. Lines starting with `!` are passed directly to the system shell, and using `!!` or `var = !cmd` captures shell output into python variables for further use.
  - The ability to expand python variables when calling the system shell. In a shell command, any python variable prefixed with `$` is expanded. A double `$$` allows passing a literal `$` to the shell (for access to shell and environment variables like `PATH`).
  - Filesystem navigation, via a magic `%cd` command, along with a persistent bookmark system (using `%bookmark`) for fast access to frequently visited directories.
  - A lightweight persistence framework via the `%store` command, which allows you to save arbitrary Python variables. These get restored when you run the `%store -r` command.
  - Automatic indentation and highlighting of code as you type (through the <span class="title-ref">prompt\_toolkit</span> library).
  - Macro system for quickly re-executing multiple lines of previous input with a single name via the `%macro` command. Macros can be stored persistently via `%store` and edited via `%edit`.
  - Session logging (you can then later use these logs as code in your programs). Logs can optionally timestamp all input, and also store session output (marked as comments, so the log remains valid Python source code).
  - Session restoring: logs can be replayed to restore a previous session to the state where you left it.
  - Verbose and colored exception traceback printouts. Easier to parse visually, and in verbose mode they produce a lot of useful debugging information (basically a terminal version of the cgitb module).
  - Auto-parentheses via the `%autocall` command: callable objects can be executed without parentheses: `sin 3` is automatically converted to `sin(3)`
  - Auto-quoting: using `,`, or `;` as the first character forces auto-quoting of the rest of the line: `,my_function a b` becomes automatically `my_function("a","b")`, while `;my_function a b` becomes `my_function("a b")`.
  - Extensible input syntax. You can define filters that pre-process user input to simplify input in special situations. This allows for example pasting multi-line code fragments which start with `>>>` or `...` such as those from other python sessions or the standard Python documentation.
  - Flexible \[configuration system \<config\_overview\>\](\#configuration-system-\<config\_overview\>). It uses a configuration file which allows permanent setting of all command-line options, module loading, code and file execution. The system allows recursive file inclusion, so you can have a base file with defaults and layers which load other customizations for particular projects.
  - Embeddable. You can call IPython as a python shell inside your own python programs. This can be used both for debugging code or for providing interactive abilities to your programs with knowledge about the local namespaces (very useful in debugging and data analysis situations).
  - Easy debugger access. You can set IPython to call up an enhanced version of the Python debugger (pdb) every time there is an uncaught exception. This drops you inside the code which triggered the exception with all the data live and it is possible to navigate the stack to rapidly isolate the source of a bug. The `%run` magic command (with the `-d` option) can run any script under pdb's control, automatically setting initial breakpoints for you. This version of pdb has IPython-specific improvements, including tab-completion and traceback coloring support. For even easier debugger access, try `%debug` after seeing an exception.
  - Profiler support. You can run single statements (similar to `profile.run()`) or complete programs under the profiler's control. While this is possible with standard cProfile or profile modules, IPython wraps this functionality with magic commands (see `%prun` and `%run -p`) convenient for rapid interactive work.
  - Simple timing information. You can use the `%timeit` command to get the execution time of a Python statement or expression. This machinery is intelligent enough to do more repetitions for commands that finish very quickly in order to get a better estimate of their running time.

<!-- end list -->

``` ipython
In [1]: %timeit 1+1
7.88 ns Â± 0.0494 ns per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 100000000 loops each)

In [2]: %timeit [math.sin(x) for x in range(5000)]
608 Âµs Â± 5.57 Âµs per loop (mean Â± std. dev. of 7 runs, 1000 loops each)
```

  - Doctest support. The special `%doctest_mode` command toggles a mode to use doctest-compatible prompts, so you can use IPython sessions as doctest code. By default, IPython also allows you to paste existing doctests, and strips out the leading `>>>` and `...` prompts in them.

## Decoupled two-process model

IPython has abstracted and extended the notion of a traditional *Read-Evaluate-Print Loop* (REPL) environment by decoupling the *evaluation* into its own process. We call this process a **kernel**: it receives execution instructions from clients and communicates the results back to them.

This decoupling allows us to have several clients connected to the same kernel, and even allows clients and kernels to live on different machines. With the exclusion of the traditional single process terminal-based IPython (what you start if you run `ipython` without any subcommands), all other IPython machinery uses this two-process model. Most of this is now part of the <span class="title-ref">Jupyter</span> project, which includes `jupyter console`, `jupyter qtconsole`, and `jupyter notebook`.

As an example, this means that when you start `jupyter qtconsole`, you're really starting two processes, a kernel and a Qt-based client which can send commands to and receive results from that kernel. If there is already a kernel running that you want to connect to, you can pass the `--existing` flag which will skip initiating a new kernel and connect to the most recent kernel, instead. To connect to a specific kernel once you have several kernels running, use the `%connect_info` magic to get the unique connection file, which will be something like `--existing kernel-19732.json` but with different numbers which correspond to the Process ID of the kernel.

You can read more about using [jupyter qtconsole](https://jupyter.org/qtconsole/), and [jupyter notebook](https://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). There is also a \[message spec \<messaging\>\](\#message-spec-\<messaging\>) which documents the protocol for communication between kernels and clients.

## Interactive parallel computing

This functionality is optional and now part of the [ipyparallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io/) project.

### Portability and Python requirements

Version 7.0+ supports Python 3.4 and higher. Versions 6.x support Python 3.3 and higher. Versions 2.0 to 5.x work with Python 2.7.x releases and Python 3.3 and higher. Version 1.0 additionally worked with Python 2.6 and 3.2. Version 0.12 was the first version to fully support Python 3.

IPython is known to work on the following operating systems:

>   - Linux
>   - Most other Unix-like OSs (AIX, Solaris, BSD, etc.)
>   - Mac OS X
>   - Windows (CygWin, XP, Vista, etc.)

See \[here \<install\_index\>\](\#here-\<install\_index\>) for instructions on how to install IPython.

# IPython Sphinx Directive

\> **Note** \> The IPython Sphinx Directive is in 'beta' and currently under active development. Improvements to the code or documentation are welcome\!

The :rst`ipython` directive is a stateful shell that can be used in reStructured text files.

It knows about standard ipython prompts, and extracts the input and output lines. These prompts will be renumbered starting at `1`. The inputs will be fed to an embedded ipython interpreter and the outputs from that interpreter will be inserted as well. For example, code blocks like the following:

    .. ipython::
    
       In [136]: x = 2
    
       In [137]: x**3
       Out[137]: 8

will be rendered as

<div class="ipython">

In \[136\]: x = 2

In \[137\]: x\*\*3 Out\[137\]: 8

</div>

\> **Note** \> This tutorial should be read side-by-side with the Sphinx source for this document because otherwise you will see only the rendered output and not the code that generated it. Excepting the example above, we will not in general be showing the literal ReST in this document that generates the rendered output.

## Directive and options

The IPython directive takes a number of options detailed here.

It's important to note that all of these options can be used for the entire directive block or they can decorate individual lines of code as explained in \[pseudo-decorators\](\#pseudo-decorators).

## Persisting the Python session across IPython directive blocks

The state from previous sessions is stored, and standard error is trapped. At doc build time, ipython's output and std err will be inserted, and prompts will be renumbered. So the prompt below should be renumbered in the rendered docs, and pick up where the block above left off.

<div class="ipython" data-verbatim="">

In \[138\]: z = x\*3 \# x is recalled from previous block

In \[139\]: z Out\[139\]: 6

In \[142\]: print(z) 6

In \[141\]: q = z\[) \# this is a syntax error -- we trap ipy exceptions ------------------------------------------------------------ File "\<ipython console\>", line 1 q = z\[) \# this is a syntax error -- we trap ipy exceptions ^ SyntaxError: invalid syntax

</div>

## Adding documentation tests to your IPython directive

The embedded interpreter supports some limited markup. For example, you can put comments in your ipython sessions, which are reported verbatim. There are some handy "pseudo-decorators" that let you doctest the output. The inputs are fed to an embedded ipython session and the outputs from the ipython session are inserted into your doc. If the output in your doc and in the ipython session don't match on a doctest assertion, an error will occur.

<div class="ipython">

In \[1\]: x = 'hello world'

\# this will raise an error if the ipython output is different @doctest In \[2\]: x.upper() Out\[2\]: 'HELLO WORLD'

\# some readline features cannot be supported, so we allow \# "verbatim" blocks, which are dumped in verbatim except prompts \# are continuously numbered @verbatim In \[3\]: x.st\<TAB\> x.startswith x.strip

</div>

For more information on @doctest decorator, please refer to the end of this page in Pseudo-Decorators section.

## Multi-line input

Multi-line input is supported.

<div class="ipython" data-verbatim="">

  - In \[130\]: url = '<http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=CROX\>  
    .....: \&d=9\&e=22\&f=2009\&g=d\&a=1\&br=8\&c=2006\&ignore=.csv'

In \[131\]: print(url.split('&')) \['<http://ichart.finance.yahoo.com/table.csv?s=CROX>', 'd=9', 'e=22',

</div>

## Testing directive outputs

The IPython Sphinx Directive makes it possible to test the outputs that you provide with your code. To do this, decorate the contents in your directive block with one of the options listed above.

If an IPython doctest decorator is found, it will take these steps when your documentation is built:

1\. Run the *input* lines in your IPython directive block against the current Python kernel (remember that the session persists across IPython directive blocks);

2\. Compare the *output* of this with the output text that you've put in the IPython directive block (what comes after <span class="title-ref">Out\[NN\]</span>);

3.  If there is a difference, the directive will raise an error and your documentation build will fail.

You can do doctesting on multi-line output as well. Just be careful when using non-deterministic inputs like random numbers in the ipython directive, because your inputs are run through a live interpreter, so if you are doctesting random output you will get an error. Here we "seed" the random number generator for deterministic output, and we suppress the seed line so it doesn't show up in the rendered output

<div class="ipython">

In \[133\]: import numpy.random

@suppress In \[134\]: numpy.random.seed(2358)

@doctest In \[135\]: numpy.random.rand(10,2) Out\[135\]: array(\[\[0.64524308, 0.59943846\], \[0.47102322, 0.8715456 \], \[0.29370834, 0.74776844\], \[0.99539577, 0.1313423 \], \[0.16250302, 0.21103583\], \[0.81626524, 0.1312433 \], \[0.67338089, 0.72302393\], \[0.7566368 , 0.07033696\], \[0.22591016, 0.77731835\], \[0.0072729 , 0.34273127\]\])

</div>

For more information on @suppress and @doctest decorators, please refer to the end of this file in Pseudo-Decorators section.

Another demonstration of multi-line input and output

<div class="ipython" data-verbatim="">

In \[106\]: print(x) jdh

  - In \[109\]: for i in range(10):  
    .....: print(i) .....: .....:

0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9

</div>

Most of the "pseudo-decorators" can be used an options to ipython mode. For example, to setup matplotlib pylab but suppress the output, you can do. When using the matplotlib `use` directive, it should occur before any import of pylab. This will not show up in the rendered docs, but the commands will be executed in the embedded interpreter and subsequent line numbers will be incremented to reflect the inputs:

    .. ipython::
       :suppress:
    
       In [144]: from matplotlib.pylab import *
    
       In [145]: ion()

<div class="ipython" data-suppress="">

In \[144\]: from matplotlib.pylab import \*

In \[145\]: ion()

</div>

Likewise, you can set `:doctest:` or `:verbatim:` to apply these settings to the entire block. For example,

<div class="ipython" data-verbatim="">

In \[9\]: cd mpl/examples/ /home/jdhunter/mpl/examples

In \[10\]: pwd Out\[10\]: '/home/jdhunter/mpl/examples'

In \[14\]: cd mpl/examples/\<TAB\> mpl/examples/animation/ mpl/examples/misc/ mpl/examples/api/ mpl/examples/mplot3d/ mpl/examples/axes\_grid/ mpl/examples/pylab\_examples/ mpl/examples/event\_handling/ mpl/examples/widgets

In \[14\]: cd mpl/examples/widgets/ /home/msierig/mpl/examples/widgets

  - In \[15\]: \!wc \*  
    2 12 77 README.txt 40 97 884 buttons.py 26 90 712 check\_buttons.py 19 52 416 cursor.py 180 404 4882 menu.py 16 45 337 multicursor.py 36 106 916 radio\_buttons.py 48 226 2082 rectangle\_selector.py 43 118 1063 slider\_demo.py 40 124 1088 span\_selector.py 450 1274 12457 total

</div>

You can create one or more pyplot plots and insert them with the `@savefig` decorator.

For more information on @savefig decorator, please refer to the end of this page in Pseudo-Decorators section.

<div class="ipython">

@savefig plot\_simple.png width=4in In \[151\]: plot(\[1,2,3\]);

\# use a semicolon to suppress the output @savefig hist\_simple.png width=4in In \[151\]: hist(np.random.randn(10000), 100);

</div>

In a subsequent session, we can update the current figure with some text, and then resave

<div class="ipython">

In \[151\]: ylabel('number')

In \[152\]: title('normal distribution')

@savefig hist\_with\_text.png width=4in In \[153\]: grid(True)

</div>

You can also have function definitions included in the source.

<div class="ipython">

  - In \[3\]: def square(x):  
    ...: """ ...: An overcomplicated square function as an example. ...: """ ...: if x \< 0: ...: x = abs(x) ...: y = x \* x ...: return y ...:

</div>

Then call it from a subsequent section.

<div class="ipython">

In \[4\]: square(3) Out \[4\]: 9

In \[5\]: square(-2) Out \[5\]: 4

</div>

### Writing Pure Python Code

Pure python code is supported by the optional argument <span class="title-ref">python</span>. In this pure python syntax you do not include the output from the python interpreter. The following markup:

    .. ipython:: python
    
       foo = 'bar'
       print(foo)
       foo = 2
       foo**2

Renders as

<div class="ipython">

python

foo = 'bar' print(foo) foo = 2 foo\*\*2

</div>

We can even plot from python, using the savefig decorator, as well as, suppress output with a semicolon

<div class="ipython">

python

@savefig plot\_simple\_python.png width=4in plot(\[1,2,3\]);

</div>

For more information on @savefig decorator, please refer to the end of this page in Pseudo-Decorators section.

Similarly, std err is inserted

<div class="ipython" data-okexcept="">

python

foo = 'bar' foo\[)

</div>

## Handling Comments

Comments are handled and state is preserved

<div class="ipython">

python

\# comments are handled print(foo)

</div>

If you don't see the next code block then the options work.

<div class="ipython" data-suppress="">

python

ioff() ion()

</div>

## Splitting Python statements across lines

Multi-line input is handled.

<div class="ipython">

python

line = 'Multi line & support & works' print(line.split('&'))

</div>

Functions definitions are correctly parsed

<div class="ipython">

python

  - def square(x):  
    """ An overcomplicated square function as an example. """ if x \< 0: x = abs(x) y = x \* x return y

</div>

And persist across sessions

<div class="ipython">

python

print(square(3)) print(square(-2))

</div>

Pretty much anything you can do with the ipython code, you can do with a simple python script. Obviously, though it doesn't make sense to use the doctest option.

## Pseudo-Decorators

Here are the supported decorators, and any optional arguments they take. Some of the decorators can be used as options to the entire block (eg `verbatim` and `suppress`), and some only apply to the line just below them (eg `savefig`).

@suppress

> execute the ipython input block, but suppress the input and output block from the rendered output. Also, can be applied to the entire `.. ipython` block as a directive option with `:suppress:`.

@verbatim

> insert the input and output block in verbatim, but auto-increment the line numbers. Internally, the interpreter will be fed an empty string, so it is a no-op that keeps line numbering consistent. Also, can be applied to the entire `.. ipython` block as a directive option with `:verbatim:`.

@savefig OUTFILE \[IMAGE\_OPTIONS\]

> save the figure to the static directory and insert it into the document, possibly binding it into a minipage and/or putting code/figure label/references to associate the code and the figure. Takes args to pass to the image directive (*scale*, *width*, etc can be kwargs); see [image options](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/docs/ref/rst/directives.html#image) for details.

@doctest

> Compare the pasted in output in the ipython block with the output generated at doc build time, and raise errors if they don't match. Also, can be applied to the entire `.. ipython` block as a directive option with `:doctest:`.

## Configuration Options

ipython\_savefig\_dir

> The directory in which to save the figures. This is relative to the Sphinx source directory. The default is <span class="title-ref">html\_static\_path</span>.

ipython\_rgxin

> The compiled regular expression to denote the start of IPython input lines. The default is <span class="title-ref">re.compile('In \[(d+)\]:s?(.\*)s\*')</span>. You shouldn't need to change this.

ipython\_rgxout

> The compiled regular expression to denote the start of IPython output lines. The default is <span class="title-ref">re.compile('Out\[(d+)\]:s?(.\*)s\*')</span>. You shouldn't need to change this.

ipython\_promptin

> The string to represent the IPython input prompt in the generated ReST. The default is <span class="title-ref">'In \[%d\]:'</span>. This expects that the line numbers are used in the prompt.

ipython\_promptout

> The string to represent the IPython prompt in the generated ReST. The default is <span class="title-ref">'Out \[%d\]:'</span>. This expects that the line numbers are used in the prompt.

# Issues closed in the 0.11 development cycle

In this cycle, we closed a total of 511 issues, 226 pull requests and 285 regular issues; this is the full list (generated with the script <span class="title-ref">tools/github\_stats.py</span>). We should note that a few of these were made on the 0.10.x series, but we have no automatic way of filtering the issues by branch, so this reflects all of our development over the last two years, including work already released in 0.10.2:

# 0.10 series

## Release 0.10.2

IPython 0.10.2 was released April 9, 2011. This is a minor bugfix release that preserves backward compatibility. At this point, all IPython development resources are focused on the 0.11 series that includes a complete architectural restructuring of the project as well as many new capabilities, so this is likely to be the last release of the 0.10.x series. We have tried to fix all major bugs in this series so that it remains a viable platform for those not ready yet to transition to the 0.11 and newer codebase (since that will require some porting effort, as a number of APIs have changed).

Thus, we are not opening a 0.10.3 active development branch yet, but if the user community requires new patches and is willing to maintain/release such a branch, we'll be happy to host it on the IPython github repositories.

Highlights of this release:

  - The main one is the closing of github ticket \#185, a major regression we had in 0.10.1 where pylab mode with GTK (or gthread) was not working correctly, hence plots were blocking with GTK. Since this is the default matplotlib backend on Unix systems, this was a major annoyance for many users. Many thanks to Paul Ivanov for helping resolve this issue.
  - Fix IOError bug on Windows when used with -gthread.
  - Work robustly if $HOME is missing from environment.
  - Better POSIX support in ssh scripts (remove bash-specific idioms).
  - Improved support for non-ascii characters in log files.
  - Work correctly in environments where GTK can be imported but not started (such as a linux text console without X11).

For this release we merged 24 commits, contributed by the following people (please let us know if we omitted your name and we'll gladly fix this in the notes for the future):

  - Fernando Perez
  - MinRK
  - Paul Ivanov
  - Pieter Cristiaan de Groot
  - TvrtkoM

## Release 0.10.1

IPython 0.10.1 was released October 11, 2010, over a year after version 0.10. This is mostly a bugfix release, since after version 0.10 was released, the development team's energy has been focused on the 0.11 series. We have nonetheless tried to backport what fixes we could into 0.10.1, as it remains the stable series that many users have in production systems they rely on.

Since the 0.11 series changes many APIs in backwards-incompatible ways, we are willing to continue maintaining the 0.10.x series. We don't really have time to actively write new code for 0.10.x, but we are happy to accept patches and pull requests on the IPython [github site](http://github.com/ipython). If sufficient contributions are made that improve 0.10.1, we will roll them into future releases. For this purpose, we will have a branch called 0.10.2 on github, on which you can base your contributions.

For this release, we applied approximately 60 commits totaling a diff of over 7000 lines:

    (0.10.1)amirbar[dist]> git diff --oneline rel-0.10.. | wc -l
    7296

Highlights of this release:

  - The only significant new feature is that IPython's parallel computing machinery now supports natively the Sun Grid Engine and LSF schedulers. This work was a joint contribution from Justin Riley, Satra Ghosh and Matthieu Brucher, who put a lot of work into it. We also improved traceback handling in remote tasks, as well as providing better control for remote task IDs.

  - New IPython Sphinx directive contributed by John Hunter. You can use this directive to mark blocks in reStructuredText documents as containing IPython syntax (including figures) and the will be executed during the build:
    
    ``` ipython
    In [2]: plt.figure()  # ensure a fresh figure
    
    @savefig psimple.png width=4in
    In [3]: plt.plot([1,2,3])
    Out[3]: [<matplotlib.lines.Line2D object at 0x9b74d8c>]
    ```

  - Various fixes to the standalone ipython-wx application.

  - We now ship internally the excellent argparse library, graciously licensed under BSD terms by Steven Bethard. Now (2010) that argparse has become part of Python 2.7 this will be less of an issue, but Steven's relicensing allowed us to start updating IPython to using argparse well before Python 2.7. Many thanks\!

  - Robustness improvements so that IPython doesn't crash if the readline library is absent (though obviously a lot of functionality that requires readline will not be available).

  - Improvements to tab completion in Emacs with Python 2.6.

  - Logging now supports timestamps (see `%logstart?` for full details).

  - A long-standing and quite annoying bug where parentheses would be added to `print` statements, under Python 2.5 and 2.6, was finally fixed.

  - Improved handling of libreadline on Apple OSX.

  - Fix `reload` method of IPython demos, which was broken.

  - Fixes for the ipipe/ibrowse system on OSX.

  - Fixes for Zope profile.

  - Fix %timeit reporting when the time is longer than 1000s.

  - Avoid lockups with ? or ?? in SunOS, due to a bug in termios.

  - The usual assortment of miscellaneous bug fixes and small improvements.

The following people contributed to this release (please let us know if we omitted your name and we'll gladly fix this in the notes for the future):

  - Boyd Waters.
  - David Warde-Farley
  - Fernando Perez

## Release 0.10

This release brings months of slow but steady development, and will be the last before a major restructuring and cleanup of IPython's internals that is already under way. For this reason, we hope that 0.10 will be a stable and robust release so that while users adapt to some of the API changes that will come with the refactoring that will become IPython 0.11, they can safely use 0.10 in all existing projects with minimal changes (if any).

IPython 0.10 is now a medium-sized project, with roughly (as reported by David Wheeler's `sloccount` utility) 40750 lines of Python code, and a diff between 0.9.1 and this release that contains almost 28000 lines of code and documentation. Our documentation, in PDF format, is a 495-page long PDF document (also available in HTML format, both generated from the same sources).

Many users and developers contributed code, features, bug reports and ideas to this release. Please do not hesitate in contacting us if we've failed to acknowledge your contribution here. In particular, for this release we have contribution from the following people, a mix of new and regular names (in alphabetical order by first name):

  - John Hunter: suggestions, bug fixes, feedback.
  - Jorgen Stenarson: work on many fronts, tests, fixes, win32 support, etc.
  - Laurent DufrÃ©chou: many improvements to ipython-wx standalone app.
  - Lukasz Pankowski: prefilter, <span class="title-ref">%edit</span>, demo improvements.

  - Vishal Vasta: ssh support in ipcluster.
  - Walter Doerwald: work on the `IPython.ipipe` system.

Below we give an overview of new features, bug fixes and backwards-incompatible changes. For a detailed account of every change made, feel free to view the project log with `bzr log`.

### New features

  - New <span class="title-ref">%paste</span> magic automatically extracts current contents of clipboard and pastes it directly, while correctly handling code that is indented or prepended with <span class="title-ref">\>\>\></span> or <span class="title-ref">...</span> python prompt markers. A very useful new feature contributed by Robert Kern.

  - IPython 'demos', created with the `IPython.demo` module, can now be created from files on disk or strings in memory. Other fixes and improvements to the demo system, by Tom Fetherston.

  - Added <span class="title-ref">find\_cmd</span> function to `IPython.platutils` module, to find commands in a cross-platform manner.

  - Many improvements and fixes to GaÃ«l Varoquaux's `ipythonx`, a WX-based lightweight IPython instance that can be easily embedded in other WX applications. These improvements have made it possible to now have an embedded IPython in Mayavi and other tools.

  - <span class="title-ref">MultiengineClient</span> objects now have a <span class="title-ref">benchmark</span> method.

  - The manual now includes a full set of auto-generated API documents from the code sources, using Sphinx and some of our own support code. We are now using the [Numpy Documentation Standard](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/blob/master/doc/HOWTO_DOCUMENT.rst.txt#docstring-standard) for all docstrings, and we have tried to update as many existing ones as possible to this format.

  - The new `IPython.Extensions.ipy_pretty` extension by Robert Kern provides configurable pretty-printing.

  - Many improvements to the `ipython-wx` standalone WX-based IPython application by Laurent DufrÃ©chou. It can optionally run in a thread, and this can be toggled at runtime (allowing the loading of Matplotlib in a running session without ill effects).

  - IPython includes a copy of Steven Bethard's [argparse](http://code.google.com/p/argparse/) in the `IPython.external` package, so we can use it internally and it is also available to any IPython user. By installing it in this manner, we ensure zero conflicts with any system-wide installation you may already have while minimizing external dependencies for new users. In IPython 0.10, We ship argparse version 1.0.

  - An improved and much more robust test suite, that runs groups of tests in separate subprocesses using either Nose or Twisted's `trial` runner to ensure proper management of Twisted-using code. The test suite degrades gracefully if optional dependencies are not available, so that the `iptest` command can be run with only Nose installed and nothing else. We also have more and cleaner test decorators to better select tests depending on runtime conditions, do setup/teardown, etc.

  - The new ipcluster now has a fully working ssh mode that should work on Linux, Unix and OS X. Thanks to Vishal Vatsa for implementing this\!

  - The wonderful TextMate editor can now be used with %edit on OS X. Thanks to Matt Foster for this patch.

  - The documentation regarding parallel uses of IPython, including MPI and PBS, has been significantly updated and improved.

  - The developer guidelines in the documentation have been updated to explain our workflow using `bzr` and Launchpad.

  - Fully refactored `ipcluster` command line program for starting IPython clusters. This new version is a complete rewrite and 1) is fully cross platform (we now use Twisted's process management), 2) has much improved performance, 3) uses subcommands for different types of clusters, 4) uses argparse for parsing command line options, 5) has better support for starting clusters using `mpirun`, 6) has experimental support for starting engines using PBS. It can also reuse FURL files, by appropriately passing options to its subcommands. However, this new version of ipcluster should be considered a technology preview. We plan on changing the API in significant ways before it is final.

  - Full description of the security model added to the docs.

  - cd completer: show bookmarks if no other completions are available.

  - sh profile: easy way to give 'title' to prompt: assign to variable '\_prompt\_title'. It looks like this:
    
        [~]|1> _prompt_title = 'sudo!'
        sudo![~]|2>

  - %edit: If you do '%edit pasted\_block', pasted\_block variable gets updated with new data (so repeated editing makes sense)

### Bug fixes

  - Fix \#368719, removed top-level debian/ directory to make the job of Debian packagers easier.
  - Fix \#291143 by including man pages contributed by Stephan Peijnik from the Debian project.
  - Fix \#358202, effectively a race condition, by properly synchronizing file creation at cluster startup time.
  - <span class="title-ref">%timeit</span> now handles correctly functions that take a long time to execute even the first time, by not repeating them.
  - Fix \#239054, releasing of references after exiting.
  - Fix \#341726, thanks to Alexander Clausen.
  - Fix \#269966. This long-standing and very difficult bug (which is actually a problem in Python itself) meant long-running sessions would inevitably grow in memory size, often with catastrophic consequences if users had large objects in their scripts. Now, using <span class="title-ref">%run</span> repeatedly should not cause any memory leaks. Special thanks to John Hunter and Sameer D'Costa for their help with this bug.
  - Fix \#295371, bug in <span class="title-ref">%history</span>.
  - Improved support for py2exe.
  - Fix \#270856: IPython hangs with PyGTK
  - Fix \#270998: A magic with no docstring breaks the '%magic magic'
  - fix \#271684: -c startup commands screw up raw vs. native history
  - Numerous bugs on Windows with the new ipcluster have been fixed.
  - The ipengine and ipcontroller scripts now handle missing furl files more gracefully by giving better error messages.
  - %rehashx: Aliases no longer contain dots. python3.0 binary will create alias python30. Fixes: \#259716 "commands with dots in them don't work"
  - %cpaste: %cpaste -r repeats the last pasted block. The block is assigned to pasted\_block even if code raises exception.
  - Bug \#274067 'The code in get\_home\_dir is broken for py2exe' was fixed.
  - Many other small bug fixes not listed here by number (see the bzr log for more info).

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - <span class="title-ref">ipykit</span> and related files were unmaintained and have been removed.

  - The <span class="title-ref">IPython.genutils.doctest\_reload</span> does not actually call <span class="title-ref">reload(doctest)</span> anymore, as this was causing many problems with the test suite. It still resets <span class="title-ref">doctest.master</span> to None.

  - While we have not deliberately broken Python 2.4 compatibility, only minor testing was done with Python 2.4, while 2.5 and 2.6 were fully tested. But if you encounter problems with 2.4, please do report them as bugs.

  - The `ipcluster` now requires a mode argument; for example to start a cluster on the local machine with 4 engines, you must now type:
    
        $ ipcluster local -n 4

  - The controller now has a `-r` flag that needs to be used if you want to reuse existing furl files. Otherwise they are deleted (the default).

  - Remove ipy\_leo.py. You can use `easy_install ipython-extension` to get it. (done to decouple it from ipython release cycle)

# 0.11 Series

## Release 0.11

IPython 0.11 is a *major* overhaul of IPython, two years in the making. Most of the code base has been rewritten or at least reorganized, breaking backward compatibility with several APIs in previous versions. It is the first major release in two years, and probably the most significant change to IPython since its inception. We plan to have a relatively quick succession of releases, as people discover new bugs and regressions. Once we iron out any significant bugs in this process and settle down the new APIs, this series will become IPython 1.0. We encourage feedback now on the core APIs, which we hope to maintain stable during the 1.0 series.

Since the internal APIs have changed so much, projects using IPython as a library (as opposed to end-users of the application) are the most likely to encounter regressions or changes that break their existing use patterns. We will make every effort to provide updated versions of the APIs to facilitate the transition, and we encourage you to contact us on the [development mailing list](http://mail.scipy.org/mailman/listinfo/ipython-dev) with questions and feedback.

Chris Fonnesbeck recently wrote an [excellent post](http://stronginference.com/post/innovations-in-ipython) that highlights some of our major new features, with examples and screenshots. We encourage you to read it as it provides an illustrated, high-level overview complementing the detailed feature breakdown in this document.

A quick summary of the major changes (see below for details):

  - **Standalone Qt console**: a new rich console has been added to IPython, started with <span class="title-ref">ipython qtconsole</span>. In this application we have tried to retain the feel of a terminal for fast and efficient workflows, while adding many features that a line-oriented terminal simply can not support, such as inline figures, full multiline editing with syntax highlighting, graphical tooltips for function calls and much more. This development was sponsored by [Enthought Inc.](http://enthought.com). See \[below \<qtconsole\_011\>\](\#below-\<qtconsole\_011\>) for details.

<!-- end list -->

  - \* **High-level parallel computing with ZeroMQ**. Using the same architecture  
    that our Qt console is based on, we have completely rewritten our high-level parallel computing machinery that in prior versions used the Twisted networking framework. While this change will require users to update their codes, the improvements in performance, memory control and internal consistency across our codebase convinced us it was a price worth paying. We have tried to explain how to best proceed with this update, and will be happy to answer questions that may arise. A full tutorial describing these features [was presented at SciPy'11](http://minrk.github.com/scipy-tutorial-2011), more details \[below \<parallel\_011\>\](\#below

\--\<parallel\_011\>).

  - **New model for GUI/plotting support in the terminal**. Now instead of the various <span class="title-ref">-Xthread</span> flags we had before, GUI support is provided without the use of any threads, by directly integrating GUI event loops with Python's <span class="title-ref">PyOS\_InputHook</span> API. A new command-line flag <span class="title-ref">--gui</span> controls GUI support, and it can also be enabled after IPython startup via the new <span class="title-ref">%gui</span> magic. This requires some changes if you want to execute GUI-using scripts inside IPython, see \[the GUI support section \<gui\_support\>\](\#the-gui-support-section-\<gui\_support\>) for more details.
  - **A two-process architecture.** The Qt console is the first use of a new model that splits IPython between a kernel process where code is executed and a client that handles user interaction. We plan on also providing terminal and web-browser based clients using this infrastructure in future releases. This model allows multiple clients to interact with an IPython process through a \[well-documented messaging protocol \<messaging\>\](\#well-documented-messaging-protocol-\<messaging\>) using the ZeroMQ networking library.
  - **Refactoring.** the entire codebase has been refactored, in order to make it more modular and easier to contribute to. IPython has traditionally been a hard project to participate because the old codebase was very monolithic. We hope this (ongoing) restructuring will make it easier for new developers to join us.
  - **Vim integration**. Vim can be configured to seamlessly control an IPython kernel, see the files in `docs/examples/vim` for the full details. This work was done by Paul Ivanov, who prepared a nice [video demonstration](http://pirsquared.org/blog/2011/07/28/vim-ipython/) of the features it provides.
  - **Integration into Microsoft Visual Studio**. Thanks to the work of the Microsoft [Python Tools for Visual Studio](http://pytools.codeplex.com) team, this version of IPython has been integrated into Microsoft Visual Studio's Python tools open source plug-in. [Details below](#ms_visual_studio_011)
  - **Improved unicode support**. We closed many bugs related to unicode input.
  - **Python 3**. IPython now runs on Python 3.x. See \[python3\_011\](\#python3\_011) for details.
  - **New profile model**. Profiles are now directories that contain all relevant information for that session, and thus better isolate IPython use-cases.
  - **SQLite storage for history**. All history is now stored in a SQLite database, providing support for multiple simultaneous sessions that won't clobber each other as well as the ability to perform queries on all stored data.
  - **New configuration system**. All parts of IPython are now configured via a mechanism inspired by the Enthought Traits library. Any configurable element can have its attributes set either via files that now use real Python syntax or from the command-line.
  - **Pasting of code with prompts**. IPython now intelligently strips out input prompts , be they plain Python ones (`>>>` and `...`) or IPython ones (`In [N]:` and `...:`). More details \[here \<pasting\_with\_prompts\>\](\#here-\<pasting\_with\_prompts\>).

### Authors and support

Over 60 separate authors have contributed to this release, see \[below \<credits\_011\>\](\#below \<credits\_011\>) for a full list. In particular, we want to highlight the extremely active participation of two new core team members: Evan Patterson implemented the Qt console, and Thomas Kluyver started with our Python 3 port and by now has made major contributions to just about every area of IPython.

We are also grateful for the support we have received during this development cycle from several institutions:

  - [Enthought Inc](http://enthought.com) funded the development of our new Qt console, an effort that required developing major pieces of underlying infrastructure, which now power not only the Qt console but also our new parallel machinery. We'd like to thank Eric Jones and Travis Oliphant for their support, as well as Ilan Schnell for his tireless work integrating and testing IPython in the [Enthought Python Distribution](http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php).
  - Nipy/NIH: funding via the [NiPy project](http://nipy.org) (NIH grant 5R01MH081909-02) helped us jumpstart the development of this series by restructuring the entire codebase two years ago in a way that would make modular development and testing more approachable. Without this initial groundwork, all the new features we have added would have been impossible to develop.
  - Sage/NSF: funding via the grant [Sage: Unifying Mathematical Software for Scientists, Engineers, and Mathematicians](http://modular.math.washington.edu/grants/compmath09) (NSF grant DMS-1015114) supported a meeting in spring 2011 of several of the core IPython developers where major progress was made integrating the last key pieces leading to this release.
  - Microsoft's team working on [Python Tools for Visual Studio](http://pytools.codeplex.com) developed the integratron of IPython into the Python plugin for Visual Studio 2010.
  - Google Summer of Code: in 2010, we had two students developing prototypes of the new machinery that is now maturing in this release: [Omar Zapata](http://ipythonzmq.blogspot.com/2010/08/ipython-zmq-status.html) and [Gerardo GutiÃ©rrez](http://ipythonqt.blogspot.com/2010/04/ipython-qt-interface-gsoc-2010-proposal.html%3E).

### Development summary: moving to Git and Github

In April 2010, after [one breakage too many with bzr](http://mail.scipy.org/pipermail/ipython-dev/2010-April/005944.html), we decided to move our entire development process to Git and Github.com. This has proven to be one of the best decisions in the project's history, as the combination of git and github have made us far, far more productive than we could be with our previous tools. We first converted our bzr repo to a git one without losing history, and a few weeks later ported all open Launchpad bugs to github issues with their comments mostly intact (modulo some formatting changes). This ensured a smooth transition where no development history or submitted bugs were lost. Feel free to use our little Launchpad to Github issues [porting script](https://gist.github.com/835577) if you need to make a similar transition.

These simple statistics show how much work has been done on the new release, by comparing the current code to the last point it had in common with the 0.10 series. A huge diff and \~2200 commits make up this cycle:

    git diff $(git merge-base 0.10.2 HEAD)  | wc -l
    288019
    
    git log $(git merge-base 0.10.2 HEAD)..HEAD --oneline | wc -l
    2200

Since our move to github, 511 issues were closed, 226 of which were pull requests and 285 regular issues (\[a full list with links \<issues\_list\_011\>\](\#a-full-list-with-links \<issues\_list\_011\>) is available for those interested in the details). Github's pull requests are a fantastic mechanism for reviewing code and building a shared ownership of the project, and we are making enthusiastic use of it.

This undercounts the number of issues closed in this development cycle, since we only moved to github for issue tracking in May 2010, but we have no way of collecting statistics on the number of issues closed in the old Launchpad bug tracker prior to that.

### Qt Console

IPython now ships with a Qt application that feels very much like a terminal, but is in fact a rich GUI that runs an IPython client but supports inline figures, saving sessions to PDF and HTML, multiline editing with syntax highlighting, graphical calltips and much more:

![The Qt console for IPython, using inline matplotlib plots.](../_images/qtconsole.png)

We hope that many projects will embed this widget, which we've kept deliberately very lightweight, into their own environments. In the future we may also offer a slightly more featureful application (with menus and other GUI elements), but we remain committed to always shipping this easy to embed widget.

See the [Jupyter Qt Console site](https://jupyter.org/qtconsole) for a detailed description of the console's features and use.

### High-level parallel computing with ZeroMQ

We have completely rewritten the Twisted-based code for high-level parallel computing to work atop our new ZeroMQ architecture. While we realize this will break compatibility for a number of users, we hope to make the transition as easy as possible with our docs, and we are convinced the change is worth it. ZeroMQ provides us with much tighter control over memory, higher performance, and its communications are impervious to the Python Global Interpreter Lock because they take place in a system-level C++ thread. The impact of the GIL in our previous code was something we could simply not work around, given that Twisted is itself a Python library. So while Twisted is a very capable framework, we think ZeroMQ fits our needs much better and we hope you will find the change to be a significant improvement in the long run.

Our manual contains a full description of how to use IPython for parallel computing, and the [tutorial](http://minrk.github.com/scipy-tutorial-2011) presented by Min Ragan-Kelley at the SciPy 2011 conference provides a hands-on complement to the reference docs.

### Refactoring

As of this release, a significant portion of IPython has been refactored. This refactoring is founded on a number of new abstractions. The main new classes that implement these abstractions are:

  - <span class="title-ref">traitlets.HasTraits</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">traitlets.config.configurable.Configurable</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">traitlets.config.application.Application</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">traitlets.config.loader.ConfigLoader</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">traitlets.config.loader.Config</span>

We are still in the process of writing developer focused documentation about these classes, but for now our \[configuration documentation \<config\_overview\>\](\#configuration-documentation \<config\_overview\>) contains a high level overview of the concepts that these classes express.

The biggest user-visible change is likely the move to using the config system to determine the command-line arguments for IPython applications. The benefit of this is that *all* configurable values in IPython are exposed on the command-line, but the syntax for specifying values has changed. The gist is that assigning values is pure Python assignment. Simple flags exist for commonly used options, these are always prefixed with '--'.

The IPython command-line help has the details of all the options (via `ipython --help`), but a simple example should clarify things; the `pylab` flag can be used to start in pylab mode with the qt4 backend:

    ipython --pylab=qt

which is equivalent to using the fully qualified form:

    ipython --TerminalIPythonApp.pylab=qt

The long-form options can be listed via `ipython --help-all`.

### ZeroMQ architecture

There is a new GUI framework for IPython, based on a client-server model in which multiple clients can communicate with one IPython kernel, using the ZeroMQ messaging framework. There is already a Qt console client, which can be started by calling `ipython qtconsole`. The protocol is \[documented \<messaging\>\](\#documented \<messaging\>).

The parallel computing framework has also been rewritten using ZMQ. The protocol is described in the ipyparallel documentation, and the code is in the new `IPython.parallel` module.

### Python 3 support

A Python 3 version of IPython has been prepared. For the time being, this is maintained separately and updated from the main codebase. Its code can be found [here](https://github.com/ipython/ipython-py3k). The parallel computing components are not perfect on Python3, but most functionality appears to be working. As this work is evolving quickly, the best place to find updated information about it is our [Python 3 wiki page](http://wiki.ipython.org/index.php?title=Python_3).

### Unicode

Entering non-ascii characters in unicode literals (`u"â¬Ã¸"`) now works properly on all platforms. However, entering these in byte/string literals (`"â¬Ã¸"`) will not work as expected on Windows (or any platform where the terminal encoding is not UTF-8, as it typically is for Linux & Mac OS X). You can use escape sequences (`"\xe9\x82"`) to get bytes above 128, or use unicode literals and encode them. This is a limitation of Python 2 which we cannot easily work around.

### Integration with Microsoft Visual Studio

IPython can be used as the interactive shell in the [Python plugin for Microsoft Visual Studio](http://pytools.codeplex.com), as seen here:

![IPython console embedded in Microsoft Visual Studio.](../_images/ms_visual_studio.png)

The Microsoft team developing this currently has a release candidate out using IPython 0.11. We will continue to collaborate with them to ensure that as they approach their final release date, the integration with IPython remains smooth. We'd like to thank Dino Viehland and Shahrokh Mortazavi for the work they have done towards this feature, as well as Wenming Ye for his support of our WinHPC capabilities.

### Additional new features

  - Added `Bytes` traitlet, removing `Str`. All 'string' traitlets should either be `Unicode` if a real string, or `Bytes` if a C-string. This removes ambiguity and helps the Python 3 transition.
  - New magic `%loadpy` loads a python file from disk or web URL into the current input buffer.
  - New magic `%pastebin` for sharing code via the 'Lodge it' pastebin.
  - New magic `%precision` for controlling float and numpy pretty printing.
  - IPython applications initiate logging, so any object can gain access to a the logger of the currently running Application with:

<!-- end list -->

``` python
from traitlets.config.application import Application
logger = Application.instance().log
```

  - You can now get help on an object halfway through typing a command. For instance, typing `a = zip?` shows the details of <span class="title-ref">zip</span>. It also leaves the command at the next prompt so you can carry on with it.
  - The input history is now written to an SQLite database. The API for retrieving items from the history has also been redesigned.
  - The `IPython.extensions.pretty` extension has been moved out of quarantine and fully updated to the new extension API.
  - New magics for loading/unloading/reloading extensions have been added: `%load_ext`, `%unload_ext` and `%reload_ext`.
  - The configuration system and configuration files are brand new. See the configuration system \[documentation \<config\_index\>\](\#documentation-\<config\_index\>) for more details.
  - The <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> class is now a <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.configurable.Configurable</span> subclass and has traitlets that determine the defaults and runtime environment. The `__init__` method has also been refactored so this class can be instantiated and run without the old `ipmaker` module.
  - The methods of <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> have been organized into sections to make it easier to turn more sections of functionality into components.
  - The embedded shell has been refactored into a truly standalone subclass of <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShell</span> called <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShellEmbed</span>. All embedding logic has been taken out of the base class and put into the embedded subclass.
  - Added methods of <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> to help it cleanup after itself. The <span class="title-ref">cleanup</span> method controls this. We couldn't do this in <span class="title-ref">\_\_del\_\_</span> because we have cycles in our object graph that prevent it from being called.
  - Created a new module `IPython.utils.importstring` for resolving strings like `foo.bar.Bar` to the actual class.
  - Completely refactored the `IPython.core.prefilter` module into <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.configurable.Configurable</span> subclasses. Added a new layer into the prefilter system, called "transformations" that all new prefilter logic should use (rather than the older "checker/handler" approach).
  - Aliases are now components (`IPython.core.alias`).
  - New top level <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.embed</span> function that can be called to embed IPython at any place in user's code. On the first call it will create an <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.InteractiveShellEmbed</span> instance and call it. In later calls, it just calls the previously created <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.InteractiveShellEmbed</span>.
  - Created a configuration system (`traitlets.config.configurable`) that is based on `traitlets`. Configurables are arranged into a runtime containment tree (not inheritance) that i) automatically propagates configuration information and ii) allows singletons to discover each other in a loosely coupled manner. In the future all parts of IPython will be subclasses of <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.configurable.Configurable</span>. All IPython developers should become familiar with the config system.
  - Created a new <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.loader.Config</span> for holding configuration information. This is a dict like class with a few extras: i) it supports attribute style access, ii) it has a merge function that merges two <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.loader.Config</span> instances recursively and iii) it will automatically create sub-<span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.loader.Config</span> instances for attributes that start with an uppercase character.
  - Created new configuration loaders in `traitlets.config.loader`. These loaders provide a unified loading interface for all configuration information including command line arguments and configuration files. We have two default implementations based on `argparse` and plain python files. These are used to implement the new configuration system.
  - Created a top-level <span class="title-ref">Application</span> class in `IPython.core.application` that is designed to encapsulate the starting of any basic Python program. An application loads and merges all the configuration objects, constructs the main application, configures and initiates logging, and creates and configures any <span class="title-ref">Configurable</span> instances and then starts the application running. An extended <span class="title-ref">BaseIPythonApplication</span> class adds logic for handling the IPython directory as well as profiles, and all IPython entry points extend it.
  - The <span class="title-ref">Type</span> and <span class="title-ref">Instance</span> traitlets now handle classes given as strings, like `foo.bar.Bar`. This is needed for forward declarations. But, this was implemented in a careful way so that string to class resolution is done at a single point, when the parent <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.HasTraitlets</span> is instantiated.
  - `IPython.utils.ipstruct` has been refactored to be a subclass of dict. It also now has full docstrings and doctests.
  - Created a Traits like implementation in `traitlets`. This is a pure Python, lightweight version of a library that is similar to Enthought's Traits project, but has no dependencies on Enthought's code. We are using this for validation, defaults and notification in our new component system. Although it is not 100% API compatible with Enthought's Traits, we plan on moving in this direction so that eventually our implementation could be replaced by a (yet to exist) pure Python version of Enthought Traits.
  - Added a new module `IPython.lib.inputhook` to manage the integration with GUI event loops using <span class="title-ref">PyOS\_InputHook</span>. See the docstrings in this module or the main IPython docs for details.
  - For users, GUI event loop integration is now handled through the new `%gui` magic command. Type `%gui?` at an IPython prompt for documentation.
  - For developers `IPython.lib.inputhook` provides a simple interface for managing the event loops in their interactive GUI applications. Examples can be found in our `examples/lib` directory.

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The Twisted-based `IPython.kernel` has been removed, and completely rewritten as `IPython.parallel`, using ZeroMQ.
  - Profiles are now directories. Instead of a profile being a single config file, profiles are now self-contained directories. By default, profiles get their own IPython history, log files, and everything. To create a new profile, do `ipython profile create <name>`.
  - All IPython applications have been rewritten to use <span class="title-ref">\~traitlets.config.loader.KeyValueConfigLoader</span>. This means that command-line options have changed. Now, all configurable values are accessible from the command-line with the same syntax as in a configuration file.
  - The command line options `-wthread`, `-qthread` and `-gthread` have been removed. Use `--gui=wx`, `--gui=qt`, `--gui=gtk` instead.
  - The extension loading functions have been renamed to <span class="title-ref">load\_ipython\_extension</span> and <span class="title-ref">unload\_ipython\_extension</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> no longer takes an `embedded` argument. Instead just use the <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShellEmbed</span> class.
  - `__IPYTHON__` is no longer injected into `__builtin__`.
  - <span class="title-ref">Struct.\_\_init\_\_</span> no longer takes <span class="title-ref">None</span> as its first argument. It must be a <span class="title-ref">dict</span> or <span class="title-ref">Struct</span>.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.ipmagic</span> has been renamed <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.magic.</span>
  - The functions <span class="title-ref">ipmagic</span> and <span class="title-ref">ipalias</span> have been removed from `__builtins__`.
  - The references to the global <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactivehell.InteractiveShell</span> instance (`_ip`, and `__IP`) have been removed from the user's namespace. They are replaced by a new function called <span class="title-ref">get\_ipython</span> that returns the current <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell</span> instance. This function is injected into the user's namespace and is now the main way of accessing the running IPython.
  - Old style configuration files `ipythonrc` and `ipy_user_conf.py` are no longer supported. Users should migrate there configuration files to the new format described \[here \</config/intro\>\](here \</config/intro\>.md) and \[here \<config\_overview\>\](\#here-\<config\_overview\>).

<!-- end list -->

  - \* The old IPython extension API that relied on <span class="title-ref">ipapi</span> has been  
    completely removed. The new extension API is described \[here \<extensions\_overview\>\](\#here

\--\<extensions\_overview\>).

  - Support for `qt3` has been dropped. Users who need this should use previous versions of IPython.
  - Removed `shellglobals` as it was obsolete.
  - Removed all the threaded shells in `IPython.core.shell`. These are no longer needed because of the new capabilities in `IPython.lib.inputhook`.
  - New top-level sub-packages have been created: `IPython.core`, `IPython.lib`, `IPython.utils`, `IPython.deathrow`, `IPython.quarantine`. All existing top-level modules have been moved to appropriate sub-packages. All internal import statements have been updated and tests have been added. The build system (setup.py and friends) have been updated. See \[/api/index\](/api/index.md) for details of these new sub-packages.
  - `IPython.ipapi` has been moved to `IPython.core.ipapi`. `IPython.Shell` and `IPython.iplib` have been split and removed as part of the refactor.
  - `Extensions` has been moved to `extensions` and all existing extensions have been moved to either `IPython.quarantine` or `IPython.deathrow`. `IPython.quarantine` contains modules that we plan on keeping but that need to be updated. `IPython.deathrow` contains modules that are either dead or that should be maintained as third party libraries.
  - Previous IPython GUIs in `IPython.frontend` and `IPython.gui` are likely broken, and have been removed to `IPython.deathrow` because of the refactoring in the core. With proper updates, these should still work.

### Known Regressions

We do our best to improve IPython, but there are some known regressions in 0.11 relative to 0.10.2. First of all, there are features that have yet to be ported to the new APIs, and in order to ensure that all of the installed code runs for our users, we have moved them to two separate directories in the source distribution, <span class="title-ref">quarantine</span> and <span class="title-ref">deathrow</span>. Finally, we have some other miscellaneous regressions that we hope to fix as soon as possible. We now describe all of these in more detail.

#### Quarantine

These are tools and extensions that we consider relatively easy to update to the new classes and APIs, but that we simply haven't had time for. Any user who is interested in one of these is encouraged to help us by porting it and submitting a pull request on our [development site](http://github.com/ipython/ipython).

Currently, the quarantine directory contains:

    clearcmd.py            ipy_fsops.py            ipy_signals.py
    envpersist.py          ipy_gnuglobal.py        ipy_synchronize_with.py
    ext_rescapture.py      ipy_greedycompleter.py  ipy_system_conf.py
    InterpreterExec.py     ipy_jot.py              ipy_which.py
    ipy_app_completers.py  ipy_lookfor.py          ipy_winpdb.py
    ipy_autoreload.py      ipy_profile_doctest.py  ipy_workdir.py
    ipy_completers.py      ipy_pydb.py             jobctrl.py
    ipy_editors.py         ipy_rehashdir.py        ledit.py
    ipy_exportdb.py        ipy_render.py           pspersistence.py
    ipy_extutil.py         ipy_server.py           win32clip.py

#### Deathrow

These packages may be harder to update or make most sense as third-party libraries. Some of them are completely obsolete and have been already replaced by better functionality (we simply haven't had the time to carefully weed them out so they are kept here for now). Others simply require fixes to code that the current core team may not be familiar with. If a tool you were used to is included here, we encourage you to contact the dev list and we can discuss whether it makes sense to keep it in IPython (if it can be maintained).

Currently, the deathrow directory contains:

    astyle.py              ipy_defaults.py          ipy_vimserver.py
    dtutils.py             ipy_kitcfg.py            numeric_formats.py
    Gnuplot2.py            ipy_legacy.py            numutils.py
    GnuplotInteractive.py  ipy_p4.py                outputtrap.py
    GnuplotRuntime.py      ipy_profile_none.py      PhysicalQInput.py
    ibrowse.py             ipy_profile_numpy.py     PhysicalQInteractive.py
    igrid.py               ipy_profile_scipy.py     quitter.py*
    ipipe.py               ipy_profile_sh.py        scitedirector.py
    iplib.py               ipy_profile_zope.py      Shell.py
    ipy_constants.py       ipy_traits_completer.py  twshell.py

#### Other regressions

  - The machinery that adds functionality to the 'sh' profile for using IPython as your system shell has not been updated to use the new APIs. As a result, only the aesthetic (prompt) changes are still implemented. We intend to fix this by 0.12. Tracked as issue [547](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/547).
  - The installation of scripts on Windows was broken without setuptools, so we now depend on setuptools on Windows. We hope to fix setuptools-less installation, and then remove the setuptools dependency. Issue [539](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/539).
  - The directory history <span class="title-ref">\_dh</span> is not saved between sessions. Issue [634](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/634).

### Removed Features

As part of the updating of IPython, we have removed a few features for the purposes of cleaning up the codebase and interfaces. These removals are permanent, but for any item listed below, equivalent functionality is available.

  - The magics Exit and Quit have been dropped as ways to exit IPython. Instead, the lowercase forms of both work either as a bare name (`exit`) or a function call (`exit()`). You can assign these to other names using exec\_lines in the config file.

# 0.12 Series

## Release 0.12.1

IPython 0.12.1 is a bugfix release of 0.12, pulling only bugfixes and minor cleanup from 0.13, timed for the Ubuntu 12.04 LTS release.

See the \[list of fixed issues \<issues\_list\_012\>\](\#list-of-fixed-issues-\<issues\_list\_012\>) for specific backported issues.

## Release 0.12

IPython 0.12 contains several major new features, as well as a large amount of bug and regression fixes. The 0.11 release brought with it a lot of new functionality and major refactorings of the codebase; by and large this has proven to be a success as the number of contributions to the project has increased dramatically, proving that the code is now much more approachable. But in the refactoring inevitably some bugs were introduced, and we have also squashed many of those as well as recovered some functionality that had been temporarily disabled due to the API changes.

The following major new features appear in this version.

### An interactive browser-based Notebook with rich media support

A powerful new interface puts IPython in your browser. You can start it with the command `ipython notebook`:

![The new IPython notebook showing text, mathematical expressions in LaTeX, code, results and embedded figures created with Matplotlib.](../_images/notebook_specgram.png)

This new interface maintains all the features of IPython you are used to, as it is a new client that communicates with the same IPython kernels used by the terminal and Qt console. But the web notebook provides for a different workflow where you can integrate, along with code execution, also text, mathematical expressions, graphics, video, and virtually any content that a modern browser is capable of displaying.

You can save your work sessions as documents that retain all these elements and which can be version controlled, emailed to colleagues or saved as HTML or PDF files for printing or publishing statically on the web. The internal storage format is a JSON file that can be easily manipulated for manual exporting to other formats.

This Notebook is a major milestone for IPython, as for years we have tried to build this kind of system. We were inspired originally by the excellent implementation in Mathematica, we made a number of attempts using older technologies in earlier Summer of Code projects in 2005 (both students and Robert Kern developed early prototypes), and in recent years we have seen the excellent implementation offered by the <span class="title-ref">Sage \<http://sagemath.org\></span> system. But we continued to work on something that would be consistent with the rest of IPython's design, and it is clear now that the effort was worth it: based on the ZeroMQ communications architecture introduced in version 0.11, the notebook can now retain 100% of the features of the real IPython. But it can also provide the rich media support and high quality Javascript libraries that were not available in browsers even one or two years ago (such as high-quality mathematical rendering or built-in video).

The notebook has too many useful and important features to describe in these release notes; our documentation now contains a directory called `examples/notebooks` with several notebooks that illustrate various aspects of the system. You should start by reading those named `00_notebook_tour.ipynb` and `01_notebook_introduction.ipynb` first, and then can proceed to read the others in any order you want.

To start the notebook server, go to a directory containing the notebooks you want to open (or where you want to create new ones) and type:

    ipython notebook

You can see all the relevant options with:

    ipython notebook --help
    ipython notebook --help-all  # even more

and just like the Qt console, you can start the notebook server with pylab support by using:

    ipython notebook --pylab

for floating matplotlib windows or:

    ipython notebook --pylab inline

for plotting support with automatically inlined figures. Note that it is now possible also to activate pylab support at runtime via `%pylab`, so you do not need to make this decision when starting the server.

### Two-process terminal console

Based on the same architecture as the notebook and the Qt console, we also have now a terminal-based console that can connect to an external IPython kernel (the same kernels used by the Qt console or the notebook, in fact). While this client behaves almost identically to the usual IPython terminal application, this capability can be very useful to attach an interactive console to an existing kernel that was started externally. It lets you use the interactive `%debug` facilities in a notebook, for example (the web browser can't interact directly with the debugger) or debug a third-party code where you may have embedded an IPython kernel.

This is also something that we have wanted for a long time, and which is a culmination (as a team effort) of the work started last year during the 2010 Google Summer of Code project.

### Tabbed QtConsole

The QtConsole now supports starting multiple kernels in tabs, and has a menubar, so it looks and behaves more like a real application. Keyboard enthusiasts can disable the menubar with ctrl-shift-M (`887`).

![The improved Qt console for IPython, now with tabs to control multiple kernels and full menu support.](../_images/qtconsole_tabbed.png)

### Full Python 3 compatibility

IPython can now be installed from a single codebase on Python 2 and Python 3. The installation process for Python 3 automatically runs 2to3. The same 'default' profile is now used for Python 2 and 3 (the previous version had a separate 'python3' profile).

### Standalone Kernel

The `ipython kernel` subcommand has been added, to allow starting a standalone kernel, that can be used with various frontends. You can then later connect a Qt console or a terminal console to this kernel by typing e.g.:

    ipython qtconsole --existing

if it's the only one running, or by passing explicitly the connection parameters (printed by the kernel at startup).

### PyPy support

The terminal interface to IPython now runs under [PyPy](http://pypy.org/). We will continue to monitor PyPy's progress, and hopefully before long at least we'll be able to also run the notebook. The Qt console may take longer, as Qt is a very complex set of bindings to a huge C++ library, and that is currently the area where PyPy still lags most behind. But for everyday interactive use at the terminal, with this release and PyPy 1.7, things seem to work quite well from our admittedly limited testing.

#### Other important new features

  - **SSH Tunnels**: In 0.11, the `IPython.parallel` Client could tunnel its connections to the Controller via ssh. Now, the QtConsole supports ssh tunneling, as do parallel engines.
  - **relaxed command-line parsing**: 0.11 was released with overly-strict command-line parsing, preventing the ability to specify arguments with spaces, e.g. `ipython --pylab qt` or `ipython -c "print 'hi'"`. This has been fixed, by using argparse. The new parsing is a strict superset of 0.11, so any commands in 0.11 should still work in 0.12.
  - **HistoryAccessor**: The <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.history.HistoryManager</span> class for interacting with your IPython SQLite history database has been split, adding a parent <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.history.HistoryAccessor</span> class, so that users can write code to access and search their IPython history without being in an IPython session (`824`).
  - **kernel %gui and %pylab**: The `%gui` and `%pylab` magics have been restored to the IPython kernel (e.g. in the qtconsole or notebook). This allows activation of pylab-mode, or eventloop integration after starting the kernel, which was unavailable in 0.11. Unlike in the terminal, this can be set only once, and cannot be changed.
  - **%config**: A new `%config` magic has been added, giving easy access to the IPython configuration system at runtime (`923`).
  - **Multiline History**: Multiline readline history has been restored to the Terminal frontend by default (`838`).
  - **%store**: The `%store` magic from earlier versions has been updated and re-enabled (\[extensions\_storemagic\](\#extensions\_storemagic); `1029`). To autorestore stored variables on startup, specify `c.StoreMagic.autorestore = True` in `ipython_config.py`.

#### Major Bugs fixed

In this cycle, we have \[closed over 500 issues \<issues\_list\_012\>\](\#closed-over-500-issues-\<issues\_list\_012\>), but a few major ones merit special mention:

  - Simple configuration errors should no longer crash IPython. In 0.11, errors in config files, as well as invalid trait values, could crash IPython. Now, such errors are reported, and help is displayed.
  - Certain SyntaxErrors no longer crash IPython (e.g. just typing keywords, such as `return`, `break`, etc.). See `704`.
  - IPython path utils, such as <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.utils.path.get\_ipython\_dir</span> now check for write permissions, so IPython should function on systems where the default path resolution might point to a read-only location, such as `HOMESHARE` on Windows (`669`).
  - <span class="title-ref">raw\_input</span> now works in the kernel when multiple frontends are in use. The request will be sent to the frontend that made the request, and an exception is raised if that frontend does not support stdin requests (e.g. the notebook) (`673`).
  - `zmq` version detection no longer uses simple lexicographical comparison to check minimum version, which prevents 0.11 from working with pyzmq-2.1.10 (`758`).
  - A bug in PySide \< 1.0.7 caused crashes on OSX when tooltips were shown (`711`). these tooltips are now disabled on old PySide (`963`).
  - IPython no longer crashes when started on recent versions of Python 3 in Windows (`737`).
  - Instances of classes defined interactively can now be pickled (`29`; `648`). Note that pickling saves a reference to the class definition, so unpickling the instances will only work where the class has been defined.

#### Backwards incompatible changes

  - IPython connection information is no longer specified via ip/port directly, rather via json connection files. These files are stored in the security directory, and enable us to turn on HMAC message authentication by default, significantly improving the security of kernels. Various utility functions have been added to `IPython.lib.kernel`, for easier connecting to existing kernels.

  - <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.zmq.kernelmanager.KernelManager</span> now has one ip, and several port traits, rather than several ip/port pair `_addr` traits. This better matches the rest of the code, where the ip cannot not be set separately for each channel.

  - Custom prompts are now configured using a new class, <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.prompts.PromptManager</span>, which has traits for <span class="title-ref">in\_template</span>, <span class="title-ref">in2\_template</span> (the `...:` continuation prompt), <span class="title-ref">out\_template</span> and <span class="title-ref">rewrite\_template</span>. This uses Python's string formatting system, so you can use `{time}` and `{cwd}`, although we have preserved the abbreviations from previous versions, e.g. `\#` (prompt number) and `\w` (working directory). For the list of available fields, refer to the source of `IPython/core/prompts.py`.

  - The class inheritance of the Launchers in `IPython.parallel.apps.launcher` used by ipcluster has changed, so that trait names are more consistent across batch systems. This may require a few renames in your config files, if you customized the command-line args for launching controllers and engines. The configurable names have also been changed to be clearer that they point to class names, and can now be specified by name only, rather than requiring the full import path of each class, e.g.:
    
        IPClusterEngines.engine_launcher = 'IPython.parallel.apps.launcher.MPIExecEngineSetLauncher'
        IPClusterStart.controller_launcher = 'IPython.parallel.apps.launcher.SSHControllerLauncher'
    
    would now be specified as:
    
        IPClusterEngines.engine_launcher_class = 'MPI'
        IPClusterStart.controller_launcher_class = 'SSH'
    
    The full path will still work, and is necessary for using custom launchers not in IPython's launcher module.
    
    Further, MPIExec launcher names are now prefixed with just MPI, to better match other batch launchers, and be generally more intuitive. The MPIExec names are deprecated, but continue to work.

  - For embedding a shell, note that the parameters `user_global_ns` and `global_ns` have been deprecated in favour of `user_module` and `module` respsectively. The new parameters expect a module-like object, rather than a namespace dict. The old parameters remain for backwards compatibility, although `user_global_ns` is now ignored. The `user_ns` parameter works the same way as before, and calling <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.frontend.terminal.embed.embed</span> with no arguments still works as before.

#### Development summary and credits

# 0.13 Series

## Release 0.13

IPython 0.13 contains several major new features, as well as a large amount of bug and regression fixes. The previous version (0.12) was released on December 19 2011, and in this development cycle we had:

  - \~6 months of work.
  - 373 pull requests merged.
  - 742 issues closed (non-pull requests).
  - contributions from 62 authors.
  - 1760 commits.
  - a diff of 114226 lines.

The amount of work included in this release is so large, that we can only cover here the main highlights; please see our \[detailed release statistics \<issues\_list\_013\>\](\#detailed-release-statistics \<issues\_list\_013\>) for links to every issue and pull request closed on GitHub as well as a full list of individual contributors.

### Major Notebook improvements: new user interface and more

The IPython Notebook, which has proven since its release to be wildly popular, has seen a massive amount of work in this release cycle, leading to a significantly improved user experience as well as many new features.

The first user-visible change is a reorganization of the user interface; the left panel has been removed and was replaced by a real menu system and a toolbar with icons. Both the toolbar and the header above the menu can be collapsed to leave an unobstructed working area:

[![New user interface for Notebook](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_spectrogram.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_spectrogram.png)

The notebook handles very long outputs much better than before (this was a serious usability issue when running processes that generated massive amounts of output). Now, in the presence of outputs longer than \~100 lines, the notebook will automatically collapse to a scrollable area and the entire left part of this area controls the display: one click in this area will expand the output region completely, and a double-click will hide it completely. This figure shows both the scrolled and hidden modes:

[![Scrolling and hiding of long output in the notebook.](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_long_out.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_long_out.png)

\> **Note** \> The auto-folding of long outputs is disabled in Firefox due to bugs in its scrolling behavior. See `2047` for details.

Uploading notebooks to the dashboard is now easier: in addition to drag and drop (which can be finicky sometimes), you can now click on the upload text and use a regular file dialog box to select notebooks to upload. Furthermore, the notebook dashboard now auto-refreshes its contents and offers buttons to shut down any running kernels (`1739`):

[![Improved dashboard](../_images/ipy_013_dashboard.png)](../_images/ipy_013_dashboard.png)

#### Cluster management

The notebook dashboard can now also start and stop clusters, thanks to a new tab in the dashboard user interface:

[![Cluster management from the notebook dashboard](../_images/ipy_013_dashboard_cluster.png)](../_images/ipy_013_dashboard_cluster.png)

This interface allows, for each profile you have configured, to start and stop a cluster (and optionally override the default number of engines corresponding to that configuration). While this hides all error reporting, once you have a configuration that you know works smoothly, it is a very convenient interface for controlling your parallel resources.

#### New notebook format

The notebooks saved now use version 3 of our format, which supports heading levels as well as the concept of 'raw' text cells that are not rendered as Markdown. These will be useful with [converters](https://github.com/ipython/nbconvert) we are developing, to pass raw markup (say LaTeX). That conversion code is still under heavy development and not quite ready for prime time, but we welcome help on this front so that we can merge it for full production use as soon as possible.

\> **Note** \> v3 notebooks can *not* be read by older versions of IPython, but we provide a [simple script](https://gist.github.com/1935808) that you can use in case you need to export a v3 notebook to share with a v2 user.

#### JavaScript refactoring

All the client-side JavaScript has been decoupled to ease reuse of parts of the machinery without having to build a full-blown notebook. This will make it much easier to communicate with an IPython kernel from existing web pages and to integrate single cells into other sites, without loading the full notebook document-like UI. `1711`.

This refactoring also enables the possibility of writing dynamic javascript widgets that are returned from Python code and that present an interactive view to the user, with callbacks in Javascript executing calls to the Kernel. This will enable many interactive elements to be added by users in notebooks.

An example of this capability has been provided as a proof of concept in `examples/widgets` that lets you directly communicate with one or more parallel engines, acting as a mini-console for parallel debugging and introspection.

#### Improved tooltips

The object tooltips have gained some new functionality. By pressing tab several times, you can expand them to see more of a docstring, keep them visible as you fill in a function's parameters, or transfer the information to the pager at the bottom of the screen. For the details, look at the example notebook `01_notebook_introduction.ipynb`.

![The new notebook tooltips.](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_tooltip.png)

### Other improvements to the Notebook

These are some other notable small improvements to the notebook, in addition to many bug fixes and minor changes to add polish and robustness throughout:

  - The notebook pager (the area at the bottom) is now Resizable by dragging its divider handle, a feature that had been requested many times by just about anyone who had used the notebook system. `1705`.
  - It is now possible to open notebooks directly from the command line; for example: `ipython notebook path/` will automatically set `path/` as the notebook directory, and `ipython notebook path/foo.ipynb` will further start with the `foo.ipynb` notebook opened. `1686`.
  - If a notebook directory is specified with `--notebook-dir` (or with the corresponding configuration flag `NotebookManager.notebook_dir`), all kernels start in this directory.
  - Fix codemirror clearing of cells with `Ctrl-Z`; `1965`.
  - Text (markdown) cells now line wrap correctly in the notebook, making them much easier to edit `1330`.
  - PNG and JPEG figures returned from plots can be interactively resized in the notebook, by dragging them from their lower left corner. `1832`.
  - Clear `In []` prompt numbers on "Clear All Output". For more version-control-friendly `.ipynb` files, we now strip all prompt numbers when doing a "Clear all output". This reduces the amount of noise in commit-to-commit diffs that would otherwise show the (highly variable) prompt number changes. `1621`.
  - The notebook server now requires *two* consecutive `Ctrl-C` within 5 seconds (or an interactive confirmation) to terminate operation. This makes it less likely that you will accidentally kill a long-running server by typing `Ctrl-C` in the wrong terminal. `1609`.
  - Using `Ctrl-S` (or `Cmd-S` on a Mac) actually saves the notebook rather than providing the fairly useless browser html save dialog. `1334`.
  - Allow accessing local files from the notebook (in urls), by serving any local file as the url `files/<relativepath>`. This makes it possible to, for example, embed local images in a notebook. `1211`.

### Cell magics

We have completely refactored the magic system, finally moving the magic objects to standalone, independent objects instead of being the mixin class we'd had since the beginning of IPython (`1732`). Now, a separate base class is provided in <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.magic.Magics</span> that users can subclass to create their own magics. Decorators are also provided to create magics from simple functions without the need for object orientation. Please see the \[magic\](\#magic) docs for further details.

All builtin magics now exist in a few subclasses that group together related functionality, and the new `IPython.core.magics` package has been created to organize this into smaller files.

This cleanup was the last major piece of deep refactoring needed from the original 2001 codebase.

We have also introduced a new type of magic function, prefixed with <span class="title-ref">%%</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">%</span>, which operates at the whole-cell level. A cell magic receives two arguments: the line it is called on (like a line magic) and the body of the cell below it.

Cell magics are most natural in the notebook, but they also work in the terminal and qt console, with the usual approach of using a blank line to signal cell termination.

For example, to time the execution of several statements:

    %%timeit x = 0   # setup
    for i in range(100000):
        x += i**2

This is particularly useful to integrate code in another language, and cell magics already exist for shell scripts, Cython, R and Octave. Using `%%script /usr/bin/foo`, you can run a cell in any interpreter that accepts code via stdin.

Another handy cell magic makes it easy to write short text files: `%%file ~/save/to/here.txt`.

The following cell magics are now included by default; all those that use special interpreters (Perl, Ruby, bash, etc.) assume you have the requisite interpreter installed:

  - `%%!`: run cell body with the underlying OS shell; this is similar to prefixing every line in the cell with `!`.
  - `%%bash`: run cell body under bash.
  - `%%capture`: capture the output of the code in the cell (and stderr as well). Useful to run codes that produce too much output that you don't even want scrolled.
  - `%%file`: save cell body as a file.
  - `%%perl`: run cell body using Perl.
  - `%%prun`: run cell body with profiler (cell extension of `%prun`).
  - `%%python3`: run cell body using Python 3.
  - `%%ruby`: run cell body using Ruby.
  - `%%script`: run cell body with the script specified in the first line.
  - `%%sh`: run cell body using sh.
  - `%%sx`: run cell with system shell and capture process output (cell extension of `%sx`).
  - `%%system`: run cell with system shell (`%%!` is an alias to this).
  - `%%timeit`: time the execution of the cell (extension of `%timeit`).

This is what some of the script-related magics look like in action:

[![Cluster management from the notebook dashboard](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_script_cells.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_script_cells.png)

In addition, we have also a number of \[extensions \<extensions\_overview\>\](\#extensions-\<extensions\_overview\>) that provide specialized magics. These typically require additional software to run and must be manually loaded via `%load_ext <extension name>`, but are extremely useful. The following extensions are provided:

  - **Cython magics** (extension `cythonmagic`)  
    This extension provides magics to automatically build and compile Python extension modules using the [Cython](http://cython.org) language. You must install Cython separately, as well as a C compiler, for this to work. The examples directory in the source distribution ships with a full notebook demonstrating these capabilities:

[![Cython magic](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_cythonmagic.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_cythonmagic.png)

  - **Octave magics** (extension `octavemagic`)  
    This extension provides several magics that support calling code written in the [Octave](http://www.gnu.org/software/octave) language for numerical computing. You can execute single-lines or whole blocks of Octave code, capture both output and figures inline (just like matplotlib plots), and have variables automatically converted between the two languages. To use this extension, you must have Octave installed as well as the [oct2py](http://pypi.python.org/pypi/oct2py) package. The examples directory in the source distribution ships with a full notebook demonstrating these capabilities:

[![Octave magic](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_octavemagic.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_octavemagic.png)

  - **R magics** (extension `rmagic`)  
    This extension provides several magics that support calling code written in the [R](http://www.r-project.org) language for statistical data analysis. You can execute single-lines or whole blocks of R code, capture both output and figures inline (just like matplotlib plots), and have variables automatically converted between the two languages. To use this extension, you must have R installed as well as the [rpy2](http://rpy.sourceforge.net/rpy2.html) package that bridges Python and R. The examples directory in the source distribution ships with a full notebook demonstrating these capabilities:

[![R magic](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_rmagic.png)](../_images/ipy_013_notebook_rmagic.png)

### Tab completer improvements

Useful tab-completion based on live inspection of objects is one of the most popular features of IPython. To make this process even more user-friendly, the completers of both the Qt console and the Notebook have been reworked.

The Qt console comes with a new ncurses-like tab completer, activated by default, which lets you cycle through the available completions by pressing tab, or select a completion with the arrow keys (`1851`).

![The new improved Qt console's ncurses-like completer allows to easily navigate thought long list of completions.](../_images/ipy_013_qtconsole_completer.png)

In the notebook, completions are now sourced both from object introspection and analysis of surrounding code, so limited completions can be offered for variables defined in the current cell, or while the kernel is busy (`1711`).

We have implemented a new configurable flag to control tab completion on modules that provide the `__all__` attribute:

    IPCompleter.limit_to__all__= Boolean

This instructs the completer to honor `__all__` for the completion. Specifically, when completing on `object.<tab>`, if True: only those names in `obj.__all__` will be included. When False \[default\]: the `__all__` attribute is ignored. `1529`.

### Improvements to the Qt console

The Qt console continues to receive improvements and refinements, despite the fact that it is by now a fairly mature and robust component. Lots of small polish has gone into it, here are a few highlights:

  - A number of changes were made to the underlying code for easier integration into other projects such as [Spyder](https://code.google.com/p/spyderlib) (`2007`, `2024`).
  - Improved menus with a new Magic menu that is organized by magic groups (this was made possible by the reorganization of the magic system internals). `1782`.
  - Allow for restarting kernels without clearing the qtconsole, while leaving a visible indication that the kernel has restarted. `1681`.
  - Allow the native display of jpeg images in the qtconsole. `1643`.

### Parallel

The parallel tools have been improved and fine-tuned on multiple fronts. Now, the creation of an <span class="title-ref">IPython.parallel.Client</span> object automatically activates a line and cell magic function `px` that sends its code to all the engines. Further magics can be easily created with the <span class="title-ref">.Client.activate</span> method, to conveniently execute code on any subset of engines. `1893`.

The `%%px` cell magic can also be given an optional targets argument, as well as a `--out` argument for storing its output.

A new magic has also been added, `%pxconfig`, that lets you configure various defaults of the parallel magics. As usual, type `%pxconfig?` for details.

The exception reporting in parallel contexts has been improved to be easier to read. Now, IPython directly reports the remote exceptions without showing any of the internal execution parts:

[![Improved parallel exceptions.](../_images/ipy_013_par_tb.png)](../_images/ipy_013_par_tb.png)

The parallel tools now default to using `NoDB` as the storage backend for intermediate results. This means that the default usage case will have a significantly reduced memory footprint, though certain advanced features are not available with this backend.

The parallel magics now display all output, so you can do parallel plotting or other actions with complex display. The `px` magic has now both line and cell modes, and in cell mode finer control has been added about how to collate output from multiple engines. `1768`.

There have also been incremental improvements to the SSH launchers:

  - add to\_send/fetch steps for moving connection files around.
  - add SSHProxyEngineSetLauncher, for invoking to <span class="title-ref">ipcluster engines</span> on a remote host. This can be used to start a set of engines via PBS/SGE/MPI *remotely*.

This makes the SSHLauncher usable on machines without shared filesystems.

A number of 'sugar' methods/properties were added to AsyncResult that are quite useful (`1548`) for everday work:

>   - `ar.wall_time` = received - submitted
>   - `ar.serial_time` = sum of serial computation time
>   - `ar.elapsed` = time since submission (wall\_time if done)
>   - `ar.progress` = (int) number of sub-tasks that have completed
>   - `len(ar)` = \# of tasks
>   - `ar.wait_interactive()`: prints progress

Added <span class="title-ref">.Client.spin\_thread</span> / <span class="title-ref">\~.Client.stop\_spin\_thread</span> for running spin in a background thread, to keep zmq queue clear. This can be used to ensure that timing information is as accurate as possible (at the cost of having a background thread active).

Set TaskScheduler.hwm default to 1 instead of 0. 1 has more predictable/intuitive behavior, if often slower, and thus a more logical default. Users whose workloads require maximum throughput and are largely homogeneous in time per task can make the optimization themselves, but now the behavior will be less surprising to new users. `1294`.

### Kernel/Engine unification

This is mostly work 'under the hood', but it is actually a *major* achievement for the project that has deep implications in the long term: at last, we have unified the main object that executes as the user's interactive shell (which we refer to as the *IPython kernel*) with the objects that run in all the worker nodes of the parallel computing facilities (the *IPython engines*). Ever since the first implementation of IPython's parallel code back in 2006, we had wanted to have these two roles be played by the same machinery, but a number of technical reasons had prevented that from being true.

In this release we have now merged them, and this has a number of important consequences:

  - It is now possible to connect any of our clients (qtconsole or terminal console) to any individual parallel engine, with the *exact* behavior of working at a 'regular' IPython console/qtconsole. This makes debugging, plotting, etc. in parallel scenarios vastly easier.

  - Parallel engines can always execute arbitrary 'IPython code', that is, code that has magics, shell extensions, etc. In combination with the `%%px` magics, it is thus extremely natural for example to send to all engines a block of Cython or R code to be executed via the new Cython and R magics. For example, this snippet would send the R block to all active engines in a cluster:
    
        %%px
        %%R
        ... R code goes here

  - It is possible to embed not only an interactive shell with the <span class="title-ref">IPython.embed</span> call as always, but now you can also embed a *kernel* with <span class="title-ref">IPython.embed\_kernel()</span>. Embedding an IPython kernel in an application is useful when you want to use <span class="title-ref">IPython.embed</span> but don't have a terminal attached on stdin and stdout.

  - The new <span class="title-ref">IPython.parallel.bind\_kernel</span> allows you to promote Engines to listening Kernels, and connect QtConsoles to an Engine and debug it directly.

In addition, having a single core object through our entire architecture also makes the project conceptually cleaner, easier to maintain and more robust. This took a lot of work to get in place, but we are thrilled to have this major piece of architecture finally where we'd always wanted it to be.

### Official Public API

We have begun organizing our API for easier public use, with an eye towards an official IPython 1.0 release which will firmly maintain this API compatible for its entire lifecycle. There is now an `IPython.display` module that aggregates all display routines, and the `traitlets.config` namespace has all public configuration tools. We will continue improving our public API layout so that users only need to import names one level deeper than the main `IPython` package to access all public namespaces.

### IPython notebook file icons

The directory `docs/resources` in the source distribution contains SVG and PNG versions of our file icons, as well as an `Info.plist.example` file with instructions to install them on Mac OSX. This is a first draft of our icons, and we encourage contributions from users with graphic talent to improve them in the future.

### New top-level <span class="title-ref">locate</span> command

Add <span class="title-ref">locate</span> entry points; these would be useful for quickly locating IPython directories and profiles from other (non-Python) applications. `1762`.

Examples:

    $> ipython locate
    /Users/me/.ipython
    
    $> ipython locate profile foo
    /Users/me/.ipython/profile_foo
    
    $> ipython locate profile
    /Users/me/.ipython/profile_default
    
    $> ipython locate profile dne
    [ProfileLocate] Profile u'dne' not found.

### Other new features and improvements

  - **%install\_ext**: A new magic function to install an IPython extension from a URL. E.g. `%install_ext https://bitbucket.org/birkenfeld/ipython-physics/raw/default/physics.py`.

  - The `%loadpy` magic is no longer restricted to Python files, and has been renamed `%load`. The old name remains as an alias.

  - New command line arguments will help external programs find IPython folders: `ipython locate` finds the user's IPython directory, and `ipython locate profile foo` finds the folder for the 'foo' profile (if it exists).

  - The `IPYTHON_DIR` environment variable, introduced in the Great Reorganization of 0.11 and existing only in versions 0.11-0.13, has been deprecated. As described in `1167`, the complexity and confusion of migrating to this variable is not worth the aesthetic improvement. Please use the historical `IPYTHONDIR` environment variable instead.

  - The default value of *interactivity* passed from <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run\_cell</span> to <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run\_ast\_nodes</span> is now configurable.

  - New `%alias_magic` function to conveniently create aliases of existing magics, if you prefer to have shorter names for personal use.

  - We ship unminified versions of the JavaScript libraries we use, to better comply with Debian's packaging policies.

  - Simplify the information presented by `obj?/obj??` to eliminate a few redundant fields when possible. `2038`.

  - Improved continuous integration for IPython. We now have automated test runs on [Shining Panda](https://jenkins.shiningpanda.com/ipython) and [Travis-CI](http://travis-ci.org/#!/ipython/ipython), as well as [Tox support](http://tox.testrun.org).

  - The [vim-ipython](https://github.com/ivanov/vim-ipython) functionality (externally developed) has been updated to the latest version.

  - The `%save` magic now has a `-f` flag to force overwriting, which makes it much more usable in the notebook where it is not possible to reply to interactive questions from the kernel. `1937`.

  - Use dvipng to format sympy.Matrix, enabling display of matrices in the Qt console with the sympy printing extension. `1861`.

  - Our messaging protocol now has a reasonable test suite, helping ensure that we don't accidentally deviate from the spec and possibly break third-party applications that may have been using it. We encourage users to contribute more stringent tests to this part of the test suite. `1627`.

  - Use LaTeX to display, on output, various built-in types with the SymPy printing extension. `1399`.

  - Add Gtk3 event loop integration and example. `1588`.

  - `clear_output` improvements, which allow things like progress bars and other simple animations to work well in the notebook (`1563`):
    
    >   - <span class="title-ref">clear\_output()</span> clears the line, even in terminal IPython, the QtConsole and plain Python as well, by printing <span class="title-ref">r</span> to streams.
    >   - <span class="title-ref">clear\_output()</span> avoids the flicker in the notebook by adding a delay, and firing immediately upon the next actual display message.
    >   - <span class="title-ref">display\_javascript</span> hides its <span class="title-ref">output\_area</span> element, so using display to run a bunch of javascript doesn't result in ever-growing vertical space.

  - Add simple support for running inside a virtualenv. While this doesn't supplant proper installation (as users should do), it helps ad-hoc calling of IPython from inside a virtualenv. `1388`.

### Major Bugs fixed

In this cycle, we have \[closed over 740 issues \<issues\_list\_013\>\](\#closed-over-740-issues-\<issues\_list\_013\>), but a few major ones merit special mention:

  - The `%pastebin` magic has been updated to point to gist.github.com, since unfortunately <http://paste.pocoo.org> has closed down. We also added a -d flag for the user to provide a gist description string. `1670`.
  - Fix `%paste` that would reject certain valid inputs. `1258`.
  - Fix sending and receiving of Numpy structured arrays (those with composite dtypes, often used as recarrays). `2034`.
  - Reconnect when the websocket connection closes unexpectedly. `1577`.
  - Fix truncated representation of objects in the debugger by showing at least 80 characters' worth of information. `1793`.
  - Fix logger to be Unicode-aware: logging could crash ipython if there was unicode in the input. `1792`.
  - Fix images missing from XML/SVG export in the Qt console. `1449`.
  - Fix deepreload on Python 3. `1625`, as well as having a much cleaner and more robust implementation of deepreload in general. `1457`.

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The exception <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.error.TryNext</span> previously accepted arguments and keyword arguments to be passed to the next implementation of the hook. This feature was removed as it made error message propagation difficult and violated the principle of loose coupling.

version0.8.md

---

# 0.8 series

## Release 0.8.4

This was a quick release to fix an unfortunate bug that slipped into the 0.8.3 release. The `--twisted` option was disabled, as it turned out to be broken across several platforms.

## Release 0.8.3

  - pydb is now disabled by default (due to %run -d problems). You can enable it by passing -pydb command line argument to IPython. Note that setting it in config file won't work.

## Release 0.8.2

  - %pushd/%popd behave differently; now "pushd /foo" pushes CURRENT directory and jumps to /foo. The current behaviour is closer to the documented behaviour, and should not trip anyone.

## Older releases

Changes in earlier releases of IPython are described in the older file `ChangeLog`. Please refer to this document for details.

---

version0.9.md

---

# 0.9 series

## Release 0.9.1

This release was quickly made to restore compatibility with Python 2.4, which version 0.9 accidentally broke. No new features were introduced, other than some additional testing support for internal use.

## Release 0.9

### New features

  - All furl files and security certificates are now put in a read-only directory named \~/.ipython/security.

  - A single function <span class="title-ref">get\_ipython\_dir</span>, in `IPython.genutils` that determines the user's IPython directory in a robust manner.

  - Laurent's WX application has been given a top-level script called ipython-wx, and it has received numerous fixes. We expect this code to be architecturally better integrated with Gael's WX 'ipython widget' over the next few releases.

  - The Editor synchronization work by Vivian De Smedt has been merged in. This code adds a number of new editor hooks to synchronize with editors under Windows.

  - A new, still experimental but highly functional, WX shell by Gael Varoquaux. This work was sponsored by Enthought, and while it's still very new, it is based on a more cleanly organized architecture of the various IPython components. We will continue to develop this over the next few releases as a model for GUI components that use IPython.

  - Another GUI frontend, Cocoa based (Cocoa is the OSX native GUI framework), authored by Barry Wark. Currently the WX and the Cocoa ones have slightly different internal organizations, but the whole team is working on finding what the right abstraction points are for a unified codebase.

  - As part of the frontend work, Barry Wark also implemented an experimental event notification system that various ipython components can use. In the next release the implications and use patterns of this system regarding the various GUI options will be worked out.

  - IPython finally has a full test system, that can test docstrings with IPython-specific functionality. There are still a few pieces missing for it to be widely accessible to all users (so they can run the test suite at any time and report problems), but it now works for the developers. We are working hard on continuing to improve it, as this was probably IPython's major Achilles heel (the lack of proper test coverage made it effectively impossible to do large-scale refactoring). The full test suite can now be run using the `iptest` command line program.

  - The notion of a task has been completely reworked. An <span class="title-ref">ITask</span> interface has been created. This interface defines the methods that tasks need to implement. These methods are now responsible for things like submitting tasks and processing results. There are two basic task types: <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.task.StringTask</span> (this is the old <span class="title-ref">Task</span> object, but renamed) and the new <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.task.MapTask</span>, which is based on a function.

  - A new interface, <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.mapper.IMapper</span> has been defined to standardize the idea of a <span class="title-ref">map</span> method. This interface has a single <span class="title-ref">map</span> method that has the same syntax as the built-in <span class="title-ref">map</span>. We have also defined a <span class="title-ref">mapper</span> factory interface that creates objects that implement <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.mapper.IMapper</span> for different controllers. Both the multiengine and task controller now have mapping capabilities.

  - The parallel function capabilities have been reworks. The major changes are that i) there is now an <span class="title-ref">@parallel</span> magic that creates parallel functions,
    
    ii) the syntax for multiple variable follows that of <span class="title-ref">map</span>, iii) both the multiengine and task controller now have a parallel function implementation.

  - All of the parallel computing capabilities from <span class="title-ref">ipython1-dev</span> have been merged into IPython proper. This resulted in the following new subpackages: `IPython.kernel`, `IPython.kernel.core`, `traitlets.config`, `IPython.tools` and `IPython.testing`.

  - As part of merging in the <span class="title-ref">ipython1-dev</span> stuff, the `setup.py` script and friends have been completely refactored. Now we are checking for dependencies using the approach that matplotlib uses.

  - The documentation has been completely reorganized to accept the documentation from <span class="title-ref">ipython1-dev</span>.

  - We have switched to using Foolscap for all of our network protocols in `IPython.kernel`. This gives us secure connections that are both encrypted and authenticated.

  - We have a brand new <span class="title-ref">COPYING.txt</span> files that describes the IPython license and copyright. The biggest change is that we are putting "The IPython Development Team" as the copyright holder. We give more details about exactly what this means in this file. All developer should read this and use the new banner in all IPython source code files.

  - sh profile: ./foo runs foo as system command, no need to do \!./foo anymore

  - String lists now support `sort(field, nums = True)` method (to easily sort system command output). Try it with `a = !ls -l ; a.sort(1, nums=1)`.

  - '%cpaste foo' now assigns the pasted block as string list, instead of string

  - The ipcluster script now run by default with no security. This is done because the main usage of the script is for starting things on localhost. Eventually when ipcluster is able to start things on other hosts, we will put security back.

  - 'cd --foo' searches directory history for string foo, and jumps to that dir. Last part of dir name is checked first. If no matches for that are found, look at the whole path.

### Bug fixes

  - The Windows installer has been fixed. Now all IPython scripts have `.bat` versions created. Also, the Start Menu shortcuts have been updated.
  - The colors escapes in the multiengine client are now turned off on win32 as they don't print correctly.
  - The `IPython.kernel.scripts.ipengine` script was exec'ing mpi\_import\_statement incorrectly, which was leading the engine to crash when mpi was enabled.
  - A few subpackages had missing `__init__.py` files.
  - The documentation is only created if Sphinx is found. Previously, the `setup.py` script would fail if it was missing.
  - Greedy `cd` completion has been disabled again (it was enabled in 0.8.4) as it caused problems on certain platforms.

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The `clusterfile` options of the `ipcluster` command has been removed as it was not working and it will be replaced soon by something much more robust.
  - The `IPython.kernel` configuration now properly find the user's IPython directory.
  - In ipapi, the <span class="title-ref">make\_user\_ns</span> function has been replaced with <span class="title-ref">make\_user\_namespaces</span>, to support dict subclasses in namespace creation.
  - <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.client.Task</span> has been renamed <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.client.StringTask</span> to make way for new task types.
  - The keyword argument <span class="title-ref">style</span> has been renamed <span class="title-ref">dist</span> in <span class="title-ref">scatter</span>, <span class="title-ref">gather</span> and <span class="title-ref">map</span>.
  - Renamed the values that the rename <span class="title-ref">dist</span> keyword argument can have from <span class="title-ref">'basic'</span> to <span class="title-ref">'b'</span>.
  - IPython has a larger set of dependencies if you want all of its capabilities. See the `setup.py` script for details.
  - The constructors for <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.client.MultiEngineClient</span> and <span class="title-ref">IPython.kernel.client.TaskClient</span> no longer take the (ip,port) tuple. Instead they take the filename of a file that contains the FURL for that client. If the FURL file is in your IPYTHONDIR, it will be found automatically and the constructor can be left empty.
  - The asynchronous clients in `IPython.kernel.asyncclient` are now created using the factory functions <span class="title-ref">get\_multiengine\_client</span> and <span class="title-ref">get\_task\_client</span>. These return a <span class="title-ref">Deferred</span> to the actual client.
  - The command line options to <span class="title-ref">ipcontroller</span> and <span class="title-ref">ipengine</span> have changed to reflect the new Foolscap network protocol and the FURL files. Please see the help for these scripts for details.
  - The configuration files for the kernel have changed because of the Foolscap stuff. If you were using custom config files before, you should delete them and regenerate new ones.

### Changes merged in from IPython1

#### New features

  - Much improved `setup.py` and `setupegg.py` scripts. Because Twisted and zope.interface are now easy installable, we can declare them as dependencies in our setupegg.py script.
  - IPython is now compatible with Twisted 2.5.0 and 8.x.
  - Added a new example of how to use `ipython1.kernel.asynclient`.
  - Initial draft of a process daemon in `ipython1.daemon`. This has not been merged into IPython and is still in <span class="title-ref">ipython1-dev</span>.
  - The `TaskController` now has methods for getting the queue status.
  - The `TaskResult` objects not have information about how long the task took to run.
  - We are attaching additional attributes to exceptions `(_ipython_*)` that we use to carry additional info around.
  - New top-level module `asyncclient` that has asynchronous versions (that return deferreds) of the client classes. This is designed to users who want to run their own Twisted reactor.
  - All the clients in `client` are now based on Twisted. This is done by running the Twisted reactor in a separate thread and using the <span class="title-ref">blockingCallFromThread</span> function that is in recent versions of Twisted.
  - Functions can now be pushed/pulled to/from engines using <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.push\_function</span> and <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.pull\_function</span>.
  - Gather/scatter are now implemented in the client to reduce the work load of the controller and improve performance.
  - Complete rewrite of the IPython documentation. All of the documentation from the IPython website has been moved into docs/source as restructured text documents. PDF and HTML documentation are being generated using Sphinx.
  - New developer oriented documentation: development guidelines and roadmap.
  - Traditional `ChangeLog` has been changed to a more useful `changes.txt` file that is organized by release and is meant to provide something more relevant for users.

#### Bug fixes

  - Created a proper `MANIFEST.in` file to create source distributions.
  - Fixed a bug in the `MultiEngine` interface. Previously, multi-engine actions were being collected with a <span class="title-ref">DeferredList</span> with `fireononeerrback=1`. This meant that methods were returning before all engines had given their results. This was causing extremely odd bugs in certain cases. To fix this problem, we have 1) set `fireononeerrback=0` to make sure all results (or exceptions) are in before returning and 2) introduced a <span class="title-ref">CompositeError</span> exception that wraps all of the engine exceptions. This is a huge change as it means that users will have to catch <span class="title-ref">CompositeError</span> rather than the actual exception.

#### Backwards incompatible changes

  - All names have been renamed to conform to the lowercase\_with\_underscore convention. This will require users to change references to all names like `queueStatus` to `queue_status`.
  - Previously, methods like <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.push</span> and <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.push</span> used `*args` and `**kwargs`. This was becoming a problem as we weren't able to introduce new keyword arguments into the API. Now these methods simple take a dict or sequence. This has also allowed us to get rid of the `*All` methods like <span class="title-ref">pushAll</span> and <span class="title-ref">pullAll</span>. These things are now handled with the `targets` keyword argument that defaults to `'all'`.
  - The <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.magicTargets</span> has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient.targets</span>.
  - All methods in the MultiEngine interface now accept the optional keyword argument `block`.
  - Renamed <span class="title-ref">RemoteController</span> to <span class="title-ref">MultiEngineClient</span> and <span class="title-ref">TaskController</span> to <span class="title-ref">TaskClient</span>.
  - Renamed the top-level module from `api` to `client`.
  - Most methods in the multiengine interface now raise a <span class="title-ref">CompositeError</span> exception that wraps the user's exceptions, rather than just raising the raw user's exception.
  - Changed the `setupNS` and `resultNames` in the `Task` class to `push` and `pull`.

# 1.0 Series

## Release 1.0.0: An Afternoon Hack

IPython 1.0 requires Python â¥ 2.6.5 or â¥ 3.2.1. It does not support Python 3.0, 3.1, or 2.5.

This is a big release. The principal milestone is the addition of `IPython.nbconvert`, but there has been a great deal of work improving all parts of IPython as well.

The previous version (0.13) was released on June 30, 2012, and in this development cycle we had:

  - \~12 months of work.
  - \~700 pull requests merged.
  - \~600 issues closed (non-pull requests).
  - contributions from \~150 authors.
  - \~4000 commits.

The amount of work included in this release is so large that we can only cover here the main highlights; please see our \[detailed release statistics \<issues\_list\_100\>\](\#detailed-release-statistics \<issues\_list\_100\>) for links to every issue and pull request closed on GitHub as well as a full list of individual contributors. It includes

### Reorganization

There have been two major reorganizations in IPython 1.0:

  - Added `IPython.kernel` for all kernel-related code. This means that `IPython.zmq` has been removed, and much of it is now in `IPython.kernel.zmq`, some of it being in the top-level `IPython.kernel`.
  - We have removed the <span class="title-ref">frontend</span> subpackage, as it caused unnecessary depth. So what was `IPython.frontend.qt` is now `IPython.qt`, and so on. The one difference is that the notebook has been further flattened, so that `IPython.frontend.html.notebook` is now just <span class="title-ref">IPython.html</span>. There is a shim module, so `IPython.frontend` is still importable in 1.0, but there will be a warning.
  - The IPython sphinx directives are now installed in `IPython.sphinx`, so they can be imported by other projects.

### Public APIs

For the first time since 0.10 (sorry, everyone), there is an official public API for starting IPython:

``` python
from IPython import start_ipython
start_ipython()
```

This is what packages should use that start their own IPython session, but don't actually want embedded IPython (most cases). <span class="title-ref">IPython.embed()</span> is used for embedding IPython into the calling namespace, similar to calling <span class="title-ref">Pdb.set\_trace</span>, whereas <span class="title-ref">start\_ipython</span> will start a plain IPython session, loading config and startup files as normal.

We also have added:

``` python
from IPython import get_ipython
```

Which is a *library* function for getting the current IPython instance, and will return `None` if no IPython instance is running. This is the official way to check whether your code is called from inside an IPython session. If you want to check for IPython without unnecessarily importing IPython, use this function:

``` python
def get_ipython():
    """return IPython instance if there is one, None otherwise"""
    import sys
    if "IPython" in sys.modules:
        import IPython
        return IPython.get_ipython()
```

### Core

  - The input transformation framework has been reworked. This fixes some corner cases, and adds more flexibility for projects which use IPython, like SymPy & SAGE. For more details, see \[/config/inputtransforms\](/config/inputtransforms.md).
  - Exception types can now be displayed with a custom traceback, by defining a `_render_traceback_()` method which returns a list of strings, each containing one line of the traceback.
  - A new command, `ipython history trim` can be used to delete everything but the last 1000 entries in the history database.
  - `__file__` is defined in both config files at load time, and `.ipy` files executed with `%run`.
  - `%logstart` and `%logappend` are no longer broken.
  - Add glob expansion for `%run`, e.g. `%run -g script.py *.txt`.
  - Expand variables (`$foo`) in Cell Magic argument line.
  - By default, `iptest` will exclude various slow tests. All tests can be run with `iptest --all`.
  - SQLite history can be disabled in the various cases that it does not behave well.
  - `%edit` works on interactively defined variables.
  - editor hooks have been restored from quarantine, enabling TextMate as editor, etc.
  - The env variable PYTHONSTARTUP is respected by IPython.
  - The `%matplotlib` magic was added, which is like the old `%pylab` magic, but it does not import anything to the interactive namespace. It is recommended that users switch to `%matplotlib` and explicit imports.
  - The `--matplotlib` command line flag was also added. It invokes the new `%matplotlib` magic and can be used in the same way as the old `--pylab` flag. You can either use it by itself as a flag (`--matplotlib`), or you can also pass a backend explicitly (`--matplotlib qt` or `--matplotlib=wx`, etc).

#### Backwards incompatible changes

  - Calling <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShell.prefilter</span> will no longer perform static transformations - the processing of escaped commands such as `%magic` and `!system`, and stripping input prompts from code blocks. This functionality was duplicated in `IPython.core.inputsplitter`, and the latter version was already what IPython relied on. A new API to transform input will be ready before release.
  - Functions from `IPython.lib.inputhook` to control integration with GUI event loops are no longer exposed in the top level of `IPython.lib`. Code calling these should make sure to import them from `IPython.lib.inputhook`.
  - For all kernel managers, the `sub_channel` attribute has been renamed to `iopub_channel`.
  - Users on Python versions before 2.6.6, 2.7.1 or 3.2 will now need to call <span class="title-ref">IPython.utils.doctestreload.doctest\_reload</span> to make doctests run correctly inside IPython. Python releases since those versions are unaffected. For details, see `3068` and [Python issue 8048](http://bugs.python.org/issue8048).
  - The `InteractiveShell.cache_main_mod()` method has been removed, and <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.new\_main\_mod</span> has a different signature, expecting a filename where earlier versions expected a namespace. See `3555` for details.
  - The short-lived plugin system has been removed. Extensions are the way to go.

### NbConvert

The major milestone for IPython 1.0 is the addition of `IPython.nbconvert` - tools for converting IPython notebooks to various other formats.

\> **Warning** \> nbconvert is Î±-level preview code in 1.0

To use nbconvert to convert various file formats:

    ipython nbconvert --to html *.ipynb

See `ipython nbconvert --help` for more information. nbconvert depends on [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) for many of the translations to and from various formats.

### Notebook

Major changes to the IPython Notebook in 1.0:

  - The notebook is now autosaved, by default at an interval of two minutes. When you press 'save' or Ctrl-S, a *checkpoint* is made, in a hidden folder. This checkpoint can be restored, so that the autosave model is strictly safer than traditional save. If you change nothing about your save habits, you will always have a checkpoint that you have written, and an autosaved file that is kept up to date.
  - The notebook supports <span class="title-ref">raw\_input</span> / <span class="title-ref">input</span>, and thus also `%debug`, and many other Python calls that expect user input.
  - You can load custom javascript and CSS in the notebook by editing the files `$(ipython locate profile)/static/custom/custom.{js,css}`.
  - Add `%%html`, `%%svg`, `%%javascript`, and `%%latex` cell magics for writing raw output in notebook cells.
  - add a redirect handler and anchors on heading cells, so you can link across notebooks, directly to heading cells in other notebooks.
  - Images support width and height metadata, and thereby 2x scaling (retina support).
  - `_repr_foo_` methods can return a tuple of (data, metadata), where metadata is a dict containing metadata about the displayed object. This is used to set size, etc. for retina graphics. To enable retina matplotlib figures, simply set `InlineBackend.figure_format = 'retina'` for 2x PNG figures, in your \[IPython config file \<config\_overview\>\](\#ipython-config-file-\<config\_overview\>) or via the `%config` magic.
  - Add display.FileLink and FileLinks for quickly displaying HTML links to local files.
  - Cells have metadata, which can be edited via cell toolbars. This metadata can be used by external code (e.g. reveal.js or exporters), when examining the notebook.
  - Fix an issue parsing LaTeX in markdown cells, which required users to type `\\\`, instead of `\\`.
  - Notebook templates are rendered with Jinja instead of Tornado.
  - `%%file` has been renamed `%%writefile` (`%%file` is deprecated).
  - ANSI (and VT100) color parsing has been improved in both performance and supported values.
  - The static files path can be found as `IPython.html.DEFAULT_STATIC_FILES_PATH`, which may be changed by package managers.
  - IPython's CSS is installed in `static/css/style.min.css` (all style, including bootstrap), and `static/css/ipython.min.css`, which only has IPython's own CSS. The latter file should be useful for embedding IPython notebooks in other pages, blogs, etc.

<!-- end list -->

  - \- The Print View has been removed. Users are encouraged to test \[ipython  
    nbconvert \<nbconvert1\>\](\#ipython

\--nbconvert-\<nbconvert1\>) to generate a static view.

#### Javascript Components

The javascript components used in the notebook have been updated significantly.

  - updates to jQuery (2.0) and jQueryUI (1.10)
  - Update CodeMirror to 3.14
  - Twitter Bootstrap (2.3) for layout
  - Font-Awesome (3.1) for icons
  - highlight.js (7.3) for syntax highlighting
  - marked (0.2.8) for markdown rendering
  - require.js (2.1) for loading javascript

Some relevant changes that are results of this:

  - Markdown cells now support GitHub-flavored Markdown (GFM), which includes `  `<span class="title-ref">python</span>\` code blocks and tables.
  - Notebook UI behaves better on more screen sizes.
  - Various code cell input issues have been fixed.

### Kernel

The kernel code has been substantially reorganized.

New features in the kernel:

  - Kernels support ZeroMQ IPC transport, not just TCP
  - The message protocol has added a top-level metadata field, used for information about messages.
  - Add a <span class="title-ref">data\_pub</span> message that functions much like <span class="title-ref">display\_pub</span>, but publishes raw (usually pickled) data, rather than representations.
  - Ensure that `sys.stdout.encoding` is defined in Kernels.
  - Stdout from forked subprocesses should be forwarded to frontends (instead of crashing).

#### IPEP 13

The KernelManager has been split into a <span class="title-ref">\~.KernelManager</span> and a <span class="title-ref">\~.KernelClient</span>. The Manager owns a kernel and starts / signals / restarts it. There is always zero or one KernelManager per Kernel. Clients communicate with Kernels via zmq channels, and there can be zero-to-many Clients connected to a Kernel at any given time.

The KernelManager now automatically restarts the kernel when it dies, rather than requiring user input at the notebook or QtConsole UI (which may or may not exist at restart time).

#### In-process kernels

The Python-language frontends, particularly the Qt console, may now communicate with in-process kernels, in addition to the traditional out-of-process kernels. An in-process kernel permits direct access to the kernel namespace, which is necessary in some applications. It should be understood, however, that the in-process kernel is not robust to bad user input and will block the main (GUI) thread while executing. Developers must decide on a case-by-case basis whether this tradeoff is appropriate for their application.

### Parallel

IPython.parallel has had some refactoring as well. There are many improvements and fixes, but these are the major changes:

  - Connections have been simplified. All ports and the serialization in use are written to the connection file, rather than the initial two-stage system.
  - Serialization has been rewritten, fixing many bugs and dramatically improving performance serializing large containers.
  - Load-balancing scheduler performance with large numbers of tasks has been dramatically improved.
  - There should be fewer (hopefully zero) false-positives for engine failures.
  - Increased compatibility with various use cases that produced serialization / argument errors with map, etc.
  - The controller can attempt to resume operation if it has crashed, by passing `ipcontroller --restore`.
  - Engines can monitor the Hub heartbeat, and shutdown if the Hub disappears for too long.
  - add HTCondor support in launchers

### QtConsole

Various fixes, including improved performance with lots of text output, and better drag and drop support. The initial window size of the qtconsole is now configurable via `IPythonWidget.width` and `IPythonWidget.height`.

The amount of work included in this release is so large that we can only cover here the main highlights; please see our \[detailed release statistics \<issues\_list\_200\>\](\#detailed-release-statistics \<issues\_list\_200\>) for links to every issue and pull request closed on GitHub as well as a full list of individual contributors.

### New stuff in the IPython notebook

#### Directory navigation

![Directory navigation](/_images/2.0/treeview.png)

The IPython notebook dashboard allows navigation into subdirectories. URLs are persistent based on the notebook's path and name, so no more random UUID URLs.

Serving local files no longer needs the `files/` prefix. Relative links across notebooks and other files should work just as if notebooks were regular HTML files.

#### Interactive widgets

![Interactive widgets](/_images/2.0/widgets.png)

IPython 2.0 adds `IPython.html.widgets`, for manipulating Python objects in the kernel with GUI controls in the notebook. IPython comes with a few built-in widgets for simple data types, and an API designed for developers to build more complex widgets. See the [widget docs](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Interactive%20Widgets/Index.ipynb) for more information.

#### Modal user interface

The notebook has added separate Edit and Command modes, allowing easier keyboard commands and making keyboard shortcut customization possible. See the new [User Interface notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/ipython/ipython/blob/2.x/examples/Notebook/User%20Interface.ipynb) for more information.

You can familiarize yourself with the updated notebook user interface, including an explanation of Edit and Command modes, by going through the short guided tour which can be started from the Help menu.

![Interface tour](/_images/2.0/user-interface.png)

#### Security

2.0 introduces a security model for notebooks, to prevent untrusted code from executing on users' behalf when notebooks open. A quick summary of the model:

  - Trust is determined by signing notebooks.
  - Untrusted HTML output is sanitized.
  - Untrusted Javascript is never executed.
  - HTML and Javascript in Markdown are never trusted.

#### Dashboard "Running" tab

![Running tab](/_images/2.0/running-crop.png)

The dashboard now has a "Running" tab which shows all of the running notebooks.

### Single codebase Python 3 support

IPython previously supported Python 3 by running 2to3 during setup. We have now switched to a single codebase which runs natively on Python 2.7 and 3.3.

For notes on how to maintain this, see \[/development/pycompat\](/development/pycompat.md).

### Selecting matplotlib figure formats

Deprecate single-format `InlineBackend.figure_format` configurable in favor of `InlineBackend.figure_formats`, which is a set, supporting multiple simultaneous figure formats (e.g. png, pdf).

This is available at runtime with the new API function <span class="title-ref">IPython.display.set\_matplotlib\_formats</span>.

### clear\_output changes

  - There is no longer a 500ms delay when calling `clear_output`.
  - The ability to clear stderr and stdout individually was removed.
  - A new `wait` flag that prevents `clear_output` from being executed until new output is available. This eliminates animation flickering by allowing the user to double buffer the output.
  - The output div height is remembered when the `wait=True` flag is used.

### Extending configurable containers

Some configurable traits are containers (list, dict, set) Config objects now support calling `extend`, `update`, `insert`, etc. on traits in config files, which will ultimately result in calling those methods on the original object.

The effect being that you can now add to containers without having to copy/paste the initial value:

    c = get_config()
    c.InlineBackend.rc.update({ 'figure.figsize' : (6, 4) })

### Changes to hidden namespace on startup

Previously, all names declared in code run at startup (startup files, `ipython -i script.py`, etc.) were added to the hidden namespace, which hides the names from tools like `%whos`. There are two changes to this behavior:

1.  Scripts run on the command-line `ipython -i script.py`now behave the same as if they were passed to `%run`, so their variables are never hidden.
2.  A boolean config flag `InteractiveShellApp.hide_initial_ns` has been added to optionally disable the hidden behavior altogether. The default behavior is unchanged.

### Using dill to expand serialization support

The new function <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.utils.pickleutil.use\_dill</span> allows dill to extend serialization support in `IPython.parallel` (closures, etc.). A <span class="title-ref">DirectView.use\_dill</span> convenience method was also added, to enable dill locally and on all engines with one call.

### New IPython console lexer

The IPython console lexer has been rewritten and now supports tracebacks and customized input/output prompts. See the \[new lexer docs \<console\_lexer\>\](\#new-lexer-docs-\<console\_lexer\>) for details.

### DisplayFormatter changes

There was no official way to query or remove callbacks in the Formatter API. To remedy this, the following methods are added to \`BaseFormatter\`:

  - `lookup(instance)` - return appropriate callback or a given object
  - `lookup_by_type(type_or_str)` - return appropriate callback for a given type or `'mod.name'` type string
  - `pop(type_or_str)` - remove a type (by type or string). Pass a second argument to avoid KeyError (like dict).

All of the above methods raise a KeyError if no match is found.

And the following methods are changed:

  - `for_type(type_or_str)` - behaves the same as before, only adding support for `'mod.name'` type strings in addition to plain types. This removes the need for `for_type_by_name()`, but it remains for backward compatibility.

Formatters can now raise NotImplementedError in addition to returning None to indicate that they cannot format a given object.

#### Exceptions and Warnings

Exceptions are no longer silenced when formatters fail. Instead, these are turned into a <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.formatters.FormatterWarning</span>. A FormatterWarning will also be issued if a formatter returns data of an invalid type (e.g. an integer for 'image/png').

### Other changes

  - <span class="title-ref">%%capture</span> cell magic now captures the rich display output, not just stdout/stderr
  - In notebook, Showing tooltip on tab has been disables to avoid conflict with completion, Shift-Tab could still be used to invoke tooltip when inside function signature and/or on selection.
  - `object_info_request` has been replaced by `object_info` for consistency in the javascript API. `object_info` is a simpler interface to register callback that is incompatible with `object_info_request`.
  - Previous versions of IPython on Linux would use the XDG config directory, creating `~/.config/ipython` by default. We have decided to go back to `~/.ipython` for consistency among systems. IPython will issue a warning if it finds the XDG location, and will move it to the new location if there isn't already a directory there.
  - Equations, images and tables are now centered in Markdown cells.
  - Multiline equations are now centered in output areas; single line equations remain left justified.
  - IPython config objects can be loaded from and serialized to JSON. JSON config file have the same base name as their `.py` counterpart, and will be loaded with higher priority if found.
  - bash completion updated with support for all ipython subcommands and flags, including nbconvert
  - `ipython history trim`: added `--keep=<N>` as an alias for the more verbose `--HistoryTrim.keep=<N>`
  - New `ipython history clear` subcommand, which is the same as the newly supported `ipython history trim --keep=0`
  - You can now run notebooks in an interactive session via `%run notebook.ipynb`.
  - Print preview is back in the notebook menus, along with options to download the open notebook in various formats. This is powered by nbconvert.
  - <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.nbconvert.utils.pandoc.PandocMissing</span> exceptions will be raised if Pandoc is unavailable, and warnings will be printed if the version found is too old. The recommended Pandoc version for use with nbconvert is 1.12.1.
  - The InlineBackend.figure\_format now supports JPEG output if PIL/Pillow is available.
  - Input transformers (see \[/config/inputtransforms\](/config/inputtransforms.md)) may now raise <span class="title-ref">SyntaxError</span> if they determine that input is invalid. The input transformation machinery in IPython will handle displaying the exception to the user and resetting state.
  - Calling `container.show()` on javascript display is deprecated and will trigger errors on future IPython notebook versions. `container` now show itself as soon as non-empty
  - Added `InlineBackend.print_figure_kwargs` to allow passing keyword arguments to matplotlib's `Canvas.print_figure`. This can be used to change the value of `bbox_inches`, which is 'tight' by default, or set the quality of JPEG figures.
  - A new callback system has been introduced. For details, see \[/config/callbacks\](/config/callbacks.md).
  - jQuery and require.js are loaded from CDNs in the default HTML template, so javascript is available in static HTML export (e.g. nbviewer).

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - Python 2.6 and 3.2 are no longer supported: the minimum required Python versions are now 2.7 and 3.3.

  - The Transformer classes have been renamed to Preprocessor in nbconvert and their `call` methods have been renamed to `preprocess`.

  - The `call` methods of nbconvert post-processors have been renamed to `postprocess`.

  - The module `IPython.core.fakemodule` has been removed.

  - The alias system has been reimplemented to use magic functions. There should be little visible difference while automagics are enabled, as they are by default, but parts of the <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.alias.AliasManager</span> API have been removed.

  - We fixed an issue with switching between matplotlib inline and GUI backends, but the fix requires matplotlib 1.1 or newer. So from now on, we consider matplotlib 1.1 to be the minimally supported version for IPython. Older versions for the most part will work, but we make no guarantees about it.

  - The `pycolor` command has been removed. We recommend the much more capable `pygmentize` command from the [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) project. If you need to keep the exact output of `pycolor`, you can still use `python -m IPython.utils.PyColorize foo.py`.

  - `IPython.lib.irunner` and its command-line entry point have been removed. It had fallen out of use long ago.

  - The `input_prefilter` hook has been removed, as it was never actually used by the code. The input transformer system offers much more powerful APIs to work with input code. See \[/config/inputtransforms\](/config/inputtransforms.md) for details.

  - <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.inputsplitter.IPythonInputSplitter</span> no longer has a method `source_raw_reset()`, but gains <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.core.inputsplitter.IPythonInputSplitter.raw\_reset</span> instead. Use of `source_raw_reset` can be replaced with:
    
        raw = isp.source_raw
        transformed = isp.source_reset()

  - The Azure notebook manager was removed as it was no longer compatible with the notebook storage scheme.

  - Simplifying configurable URLs
    
      - base\_project\_url is renamed to base\_url (base\_project\_url is kept as a deprecated alias, for now)
      - base\_kernel\_url configurable is removed (use base\_url)
      - websocket\_url configurable is removed (use base\_url)

See \[issues\_list\_3\](\#issues\_list\_3) for details.

## Release 3.0

Released February 27, 2015

This is a really big release. Over 150 contributors, and almost 6000 commits in a bit under a year. Support for languages other than Python is greatly improved, notebook UI has been significantly redesigned, and a lot of improvement has happened in the experimental interactive widgets. The message protocol and document format have both been updated, while maintaining better compatibility with previous versions than prior updates. The notebook webapp now enables editing of any text file, and even a web-based terminal (on Unix platforms).

3.x will be the last monolithic release of IPython, as the next release cycle will see the growing project split into its Python-specific and language-agnostic components. Language-agnostic projects (notebook, qtconsole, etc.) will move under the umbrella of the new Project Jupyter name, while Python-specific projects (interactive Python shell, Python kernel, IPython.parallel) will remain under IPython, and be split into a few smaller packages. To reflect this, IPython is in a bit of a transition state. The logo on the notebook is now the Jupyter logo. When installing kernels system-wide, they go in a <span class="title-ref">jupyter</span> directory. We are going to do our best to ease this transition for users and developers.

Big changes are ahead.

### Using different kernels

![Screenshot of 'new' dropdown showing different kernels](../_images/kernel_selector_screenshot.png)

You can now choose a kernel for a notebook within the user interface, rather than starting up a separate notebook server for each kernel you want to use. The syntax highlighting adapts to match the language you're working in.

Information about the kernel is stored in the notebook file, so when you open a notebook, it will automatically start the correct kernel.

It is also easier to use the Qt console and the terminal console with other kernels, using the --kernel flag:

    ipython qtconsole --kernel bash
    ipython console --kernel bash
    
    # To list available kernels
    ipython kernelspec list

Kernel authors should see \[kernelspecs\](\#kernelspecs) for how to register their kernels with IPython so that these mechanisms work.

### Typing unicode identifiers

![image](/_images/unicode_completion.png)

Complex expressions can be much cleaner when written with a wider choice of characters. Python 3 allows unicode identifiers, and IPython 3 makes it easier to type those, using a feature from Julia. Type a backslash followed by a LaTeX style short name, such as `\alpha`. Press tab, and it will turn into Î±.

### Widget migration guide

The widget framework has a lot of backwards incompatible changes. For information about migrating widget notebooks and custom widgets to 3.0 refer to the \[widget migration guide\<version3\_widget\_migration\>\](widget migration guide\<version3\_widget\_migration\>.md).

### Other new features

  - <span class="title-ref">\~.TextWidget</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.TextareaWidget</span> objects now include a `placeholder` attribute, for displaying placeholder text before the user has typed anything.

  - The `load` magic can now find the source for objects in the user namespace. To enable searching the namespace, use the `-n` option.
    
    ``` ipython
    In [1]: %load -n my_module.some_function
    ```

  - <span class="title-ref">\~.DirectView</span> objects have a new <span class="title-ref">\~.DirectView.use\_cloudpickle</span> method, which works like `view.use_dill()`, but causes the `cloudpickle` module from PiCloud's <span class="title-ref">cloud</span>\_\_ library to be used rather than dill or the builtin pickle module.
    
    \_\_ <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cloud>

  - Added a .ipynb exporter to nbconvert. It can be used by passing <span class="title-ref">--to notebook</span> as a commandline argument to nbconvert.

  - New nbconvert preprocessor called <span class="title-ref">\~.ClearOutputPreprocessor</span>. This clears the output from IPython notebooks.

  - New preprocessor for nbconvert that executes all the code cells in a notebook. To run a notebook and save its output in a new notebook:
    
        ipython nbconvert InputNotebook --ExecutePreprocessor.enabled=True --to notebook --output Executed

  - Consecutive stream (stdout/stderr) output is merged into a single output in the notebook document. Previously, all output messages were preserved as separate output fields in the JSON. Now, the same merge is applied to the stored output as the displayed output, improving document load time for notebooks with many small outputs.

  - `NotebookApp.webapp_settings` is deprecated and replaced with the more informatively named `NotebookApp.tornado_settings`.

  - Using `timeit` prints warnings if there is at least a 4x difference in timings between the slowest and fastest runs, since this might meant that the multiple runs are not independent of one another.

  - It's now possible to provide mechanisms to integrate IPython with other event loops, in addition to the ones we already support. This lets you run GUI code in IPython with an interactive prompt, and to embed the IPython kernel in GUI applications. See \[/config/eventloops\](/config/eventloops.md) for details. As part of this, the direct `enable_*` and `disable_*` functions for various GUIs in `IPython.lib.inputhook` have been deprecated in favour of <span class="title-ref">\~.InputHookManager.enable\_gui</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.InputHookManager.disable\_gui</span>.

  - A `ScrollManager` was added to the notebook. The `ScrollManager` controls how the notebook document is scrolled using keyboard. Users can inherit from the `ScrollManager` or `TargetScrollManager` to customize how their notebook scrolls. The default `ScrollManager` is the `SlideScrollManager`, which tries to scroll to the nearest slide or sub-slide cell.

  - The function <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.html.widgets.interaction.interact\_manual</span> has been added which behaves similarly to <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.html.widgets.interaction.interact</span>, but adds a button to explicitly run the interacted-with function, rather than doing it automatically for every change of the parameter widgets. This should be useful for long-running functions.

  - The `%cython` magic is now part of the Cython module. Use <span class="title-ref">%load\_ext Cython</span> with a version of Cython \>= 0.21 to have access to the magic now.

  - The Notebook application now offers integrated terminals on Unix platforms, intended for when it is used on a remote server. To enable these, install the `terminado` Python package.

  - The Notebook application can now edit any plain text files, via a full-page CodeMirror instance.

  - Setting the default highlighting language for nbconvert with the config option `NbConvertBase.default_language` is deprecated. Nbconvert now respects metadata stored in the \[kernel spec \<kernelspecs\>\](\#kernel-spec-\<kernelspecs\>).

  - IPython can now be configured systemwide, with files in `/etc/ipython` or `/usr/local/etc/ipython` on Unix systems, or `{%PROGRAMDATA%}\\ipython` on Windows.

  - Added support for configurable user-supplied [Jinja](http://jinja.pocoo.org/) HTML templates for the notebook. Paths to directories containing template files can be specified via `NotebookApp.extra_template_paths`. User-supplied template directories searched first by the notebook, making it possible to replace existing templates with your own files.
    
    For example, to replace the notebook's built-in `error.html` with your own, create a directory like `/home/my_templates` and put your override template at `/home/my_templates/error.html`. To start the notebook with your custom error page enabled, you would run:
    
        ipython notebook '--extra_template_paths=["/home/my_templates/"]'
    
    It's also possible to override a template while also [inheriting](http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/dev/templates/#template-inheritance) from that template, by prepending `templates/` to the `{% extends %}` target of your child template. This is useful when you only want to override a specific block of a template. For example, to add additional CSS to the built-in `error.html`, you might create an override that looks like:
    
        {% extends "templates/error.html" %}
        
        {% block stylesheet %}
        {{super()}}
        <style type="text/css">
          /* My Awesome CSS */
        </style>
        {% endblock %}

  - Added a widget persistence API. This allows you to persist your notebooks interactive widgets. Two levels of control are provided:
    
    1.  Higher level- `WidgetManager.set_state_callbacks` allows you to register callbacks for loading and saving widget state. The callbacks you register are automatically called when necessary.
    2.  Lower level- the `WidgetManager` Javascript class now has `get_state` and `set_state` methods that allow you to get and set the state of the widget runtime.
    
    Example code for persisting your widget state to session data:
    
        %%javascript
        require(['widgets/js/manager'], function(manager) {
            manager.WidgetManager.set_state_callbacks(function() { // Load
                return JSON.parse(sessionStorage.widgets_state || '{}');
            }, function(state) { // Save
                sessionStorage.widgets_state = JSON.stringify(state);
            });
        });

  - Enhanced support for `env` magic. As before, `env` with no arguments displays all environment variables and values. Additionally, `env` can be used to get or set individual environment variables. To display an individual value, use the <span class="title-ref">%env var</span> syntax. To set a value, use <span class="title-ref">env var val</span> or <span class="title-ref">env var=val</span>. Python value expansion using <span class="title-ref">$</span> works as usual.

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The \[message protocol \<messaging\>\](\#message-protocol-\<messaging\>) has been updated from version 4 to version 5. Adapters are included, so IPython frontends can still talk to kernels that implement protocol version 4.

  - The notebook format has been updated from version 3 to version 4. Read-only support for v4 notebooks has been backported to IPython 2.4. Notable changes:
    
      - heading cells are removed in favor or markdown headings
      - notebook outputs and output messages are more consistent with each other
      - use <span class="title-ref">IPython.nbformat.read</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~IPython.nbformat.write</span> to read and write notebook files instead of the deprecated `IPython.nbformat.current` APIs.
    
    You can downgrade a notebook to v3 via `nbconvert`:
    
        ipython nbconvert --to notebook --nbformat 3 <notebook>
    
    which will create `notebook.v3.ipynb`, a copy of the notebook in v3 format.

  - <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.oinspect.getsource</span> call specification has changed:
    
      - <span class="title-ref">oname</span> keyword argument has been added for property source formatting
      - <span class="title-ref">is\_binary</span> keyword argument has been dropped, passing `True` had previously short-circuited the function to return `None` unconditionally

  - Removed the octavemagic extension: it is now available as `oct2py.ipython`.

  - Creating PDFs with LaTeX no longer uses a post processor. Use <span class="title-ref">nbconvert --to pdf</span> instead of <span class="title-ref">nbconvert --to latex --post pdf</span>.

  - Used <https://github.com/jdfreder/bootstrap2to3> to migrate the Notebook to Bootstrap 3.
    
    Additional changes:
    
      - Set <span class="title-ref">.tab-content .row</span> <span class="title-ref">0px;</span> left and right margin (bootstrap default is <span class="title-ref">-15px;</span>)
      - Removed <span class="title-ref">height: @btn\_mini\_height;</span> from <span class="title-ref">.list\_header\>div, .list\_item\>div</span> in <span class="title-ref">tree.less</span>
      - Set <span class="title-ref">\#header</span> div <span class="title-ref">margin-bottom: 0px;</span>
      - Set <span class="title-ref">\#menus</span> to <span class="title-ref">float: left;</span>
      - Set <span class="title-ref">\#maintoolbar .navbar-text</span> to <span class="title-ref">float: none;</span>
      - Added no-padding convenience class.
      - Set border of \#maintoolbar to 0px

  - Accessing the <span class="title-ref">container</span> DOM object when displaying javascript has been deprecated in IPython 2.0 in favor of accessing <span class="title-ref">element</span>. Starting with IPython 3.0 trying to access <span class="title-ref">container</span> will raise an error in browser javascript console.

  - `IPython.utils.py3compat.open` was removed: <span class="title-ref">io.open</span> provides all the same functionality.

  - The NotebookManager and `/api/notebooks` service has been replaced by a more generic ContentsManager and `/api/contents` service, which supports all kinds of files.

  - The Dashboard now lists all files, not just notebooks and directories.

  - The `--script` hook for saving notebooks to Python scripts is removed, use `ipython nbconvert --to python {notebook}` instead.

  - The `rmagic` extension is deprecated, as it is now part of rpy2. See `rpy2.ipython.rmagic`.

  - <span class="title-ref">\~.KernelManager.start\_kernel</span> and <span class="title-ref">\~.KernelManager.format\_kernel\_cmd</span> no longer accept a `executable` parameter. Use the kernelspec machinery instead.

  - The widget classes have been renamed from <span class="title-ref">\*Widget</span> to <span class="title-ref">\*</span>. The old names are still functional, but are deprecated. i.e. <span class="title-ref">IntSliderWidget</span> has been renamed to <span class="title-ref">IntSlider</span>.

  - The ContainerWidget was renamed to Box and no longer defaults as a flexible box in the web browser. A new FlexBox widget was added, which allows you to use the flexible box model.

  - The notebook now uses a single websocket at <span class="title-ref">/kernels/\<kernel-id\>/channels</span> instead of separate <span class="title-ref">/kernels/\<kernel-id\>/{shell|iopub|stdin}</span> channels. Messages on each channel are identified by a <span class="title-ref">channel</span> key in the message dict, for both send and recv.

#### Content Security Policy

The Content Security Policy is a web standard for adding a layer of security to detect and mitigate certain classes of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. This was introduced into the notebook to ensure that the IPython Notebook and its APIs (by default) can only be embedded in an iframe on the same origin.

Override `headers['Content-Security-Policy']` within your notebook configuration to extend for alternate domains and security settings.:

    c.NotebookApp.tornado_settings = {
        'headers': {
            'Content-Security-Policy': "frame-ancestors 'self'"
        }
    }

Example policies:

    Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self' https://*.jupyter.org

Matches embeddings on any subdomain of jupyter.org, so long as they are served over SSL.

There is a [report-uri](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri) endpoint available for logging CSP violations, located at `/api/security/csp-report`. To use it, set `report-uri` as part of the CSP:

    c.NotebookApp.tornado_settings = {
        'headers': {
            'Content-Security-Policy': "frame-ancestors 'self'; report-uri /api/security/csp-report"
        }
    }

It simply provides the CSP report as a warning in IPython's logs. The default CSP sets this report-uri relative to the `base_url` (not shown above).

For a more thorough and accurate guide on Content Security Policies, check out [MDN's Using Content Security Policy](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/CSP/Using_Content_Security_Policy) for more examples.

# Migrating Widgets to IPython 3

## Upgrading Notebooks

1.  The first thing you'll notice when upgrading an IPython 2.0 widget notebook to IPython 3.0 is the "Notebook converted" dialog. Click "ok".
2.  All of the widgets distributed with IPython have been renamed. The "Widget" suffix was removed from the end of the class name. i.e. `ButtonWidget` is now `Button`.
3.  `ContainerWidget` was renamed to `Box`.
4.  `PopupWidget` was removed from IPython, because bootstrapjs was problematic (creates global variables, etc.). If you use the `PopupWidget`, try using a `Box` widget instead. If your notebook can't live without the popup functionality, subclass the `Box` widget (both in Python and JS) and use JQuery UI's `draggable()` and `resizable()` methods to mimic the behavior.
5.  `add_class` and `remove_class` were removed. More often than not a new attribute exists on the widget that allows you to achieve the same explicitly. i.e. the `Button` widget now has a `button_style` attribute which you can set to 'primary', 'success', 'info', 'warning', 'danger', or '' instead of using `add_class` to add the bootstrap class. `VBox` and `HBox` classes (flexible `Box` subclasses) were added that allow you to avoid using `add_class` and `remove_class` to make flexible box model layouts. As a last resort, if you can't find a built in attribute for the class you want to use, a new `_dom_classes` list trait was added, which combines `add_class` and `remove_class` into one stateful list.
6.  `set_css` and `get_css` were removed in favor of explicit style attributes - `visible`, `width`, `height`, `padding`, `margin`, `color`, `background_color`, `border_color`, `border_width`, `border_radius`, `border_style`, `font_style`, `font_weight`, `font_size`, and `font_family` are a few. If you can't find a trait to see the css attribute you need, you can, in order of preference, (A) subclass to create your own custom widget, (B) use CSS and the `_dom_classes` trait to set `_dom_classes`, or (C) use the `_css` dictionary to set CSS styling like `set_css` and `get_css`.
7.  For selection widgets, such as `Dropdown`, the `values` argument has been renamed to `options`.

## Upgrading Custom Widgets

### Javascript

1.  If you are distributing your widget and decide to use the deferred loading technique (preferred), you can remove all references to the WidgetManager and the register model/view calls (see the Python section below for more information).

2.  In 2.0 require.js was used incorrectly, that has been fixed and now loading works more like Python's import. Requiring `widgets/js/widget` doesn't import the `WidgetManager` class, instead it imports a dictionary that exposes the classes within that module:
    
    ``` javascript
    {
    'WidgetModel': WidgetModel,
    'WidgetView': WidgetView,
    'DOMWidgetView': DOMWidgetView,
    'ViewList': ViewList,
    }
    ```
    
    If you decide to continue to use the widget registry (by registering your widgets with the manager), you can import a dictionary with a handle to the WidgetManager class by requiring `widgets/js/manager`. Doing so will import:
    
    ``` javascript
    {'WidgetManager': WidgetManager}
    ```

3.  Don't rely on the `IPython` namespace for anything. To inherit from the DOMWidgetView, WidgetView, or WidgetModel, require `widgets/js/widget` as `widget`. If you were inheriting from DOMWidgetView, and the code looked like this:
    
    ``` javascript
    IPython.DOMWidgetView.extend({...})
    ```
    
    It would become this:
    
    ``` javascript
    widget.DOMWidgetView.extend({...})
    ```

4.  Custom models are encouraged. When possible, it's recommended to move your code into a custom model, so actions are performed 1 time, instead of N times where N is the number of displayed views.

### Python

Generally, custom widget Python code can remain unchanged. If you distribute your custom widget, you may be using `display` and `Javascript` to publish the widget's Javascript to the front-end. That is no longer the recommended way of distributing widget Javascript. Instead have the user install the Javascript to his/her nbextension directory or their profile's static directory. Then use the new `_view_module` and `_model_module` traitlets in combination with `_view_name` and `_model_name` to instruct require.js on how to load the widget's Javascript. The Javascript is then loaded when the widget is used for the first time.

## Details

### Asynchronous

In the IPython 2.x series the only way to register custom widget views and models was to use the registry in the widget manager. Unfortunately, using this method made distributing and running custom widgets difficult. The widget maintainer had to either use the rich display framework to push the widget's Javascript to the notebook or instruct the users to install the Javascript by hand in a custom profile. With the first method, the maintainer would have to be careful about when the Javascript was pushed to the front-end. If the Javascript was pushed on Python widget `import`, the widgets wouldn't work after page refresh. This is because refreshing the page does not restart the kernel, and the Python `import` statement only runs once in a given kernel instance (unless you reload the Python modules, which isn't straight forward). This meant the maintainer would have to have a separate `push_js()` method that the user would have to call after importing the widget's Python code.

Our solution was to add support for loading widget views and models using require.js paths. Thus the comm and widget frameworks now support lazy loading. To do so, everything had to be converted to asynchronous code. HTML5 promises are used to accomplish that ([\#6818](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6818), [\#6914](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6914)).

### Symmetry

In IPython 3.0, widgets can be instantiated from the front-end ([\#6664](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6664)). On top of this, a widget persistence API was added ([\#7163](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7163), [\#7227](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7227)). With the widget persistence API, you can persist your widget instances using Javascript. This makes it easy to persist your widgets to your notebook document (with a small amount of custom JS). By default, the widgets are persisted to your web browsers local storage which makes them reappear when your refresh the page.

### Smaller Changes

  - Latex math is supported in widget `description`s ([\#5937](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5937)).
  - Widgets can be display more than once within a single container widget ([\#5963](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/5963), [\#6990](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990)).
  - `FloatRangeSlider` and `IntRangeSlider` were added ([\#6050](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6050)).
  - "Widget" was removed from the ends of all of the widget class names ([\#6125](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6125)).
  - `ContainerWidget` was renamed to `Box` ([\#6125](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6125)).
  - `HBox` and `VBox` widgets were added ([\#6125](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6125)).
  - `add\_class` and `remove\_class` were removed in favor of a `_dom_classes` list ([\#6235](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6235)).
  - `get\_css` and `set\_css` were removed in favor of explicit traits for widget styling ([\#6235](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6235)).
  - `jslink` and `jsdlink` were added ([\#6454](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6454), [\#7468](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7468)).
  - An `Output` widget was added, which allows you to `print` and `display` within widgets ([\#6670](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6670)).
  - `PopupWidget` was removed ([\#7341](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7341)).
  - A visual cue was added for widgets with 'dead' comms ([\#7227](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7227)).
  - A `SelectMultiple` widget was added (a `Select` widget that allows multiple things to be selected at once) ([\#6890](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6890)).
  - A class was added to help manage children views ([\#6990](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/6990)).
  - A warning was added that shows on widget import because it's expected that the API will change again by IPython 4.0. This warning can be suppressed ([\#7107](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7107), [\#7200](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7200), [\#7201](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7201), [\#7204](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pull/7204)).

# 4.x Series

## IPython 4.2

IPython 4.2 (April, 2016) includes various bugfixes and improvements over 4.1.

  - Fix `ipython -i` on errors, which was broken in 4.1.
  - The delay meant to highlight deprecated commands that have moved to jupyter has been removed.
  - Improve compatibility with future versions of traitlets and matplotlib.
  - Use stdlib <span class="title-ref">python:shutil.get\_terminal\_size</span> to measure terminal width when displaying tracebacks (provided by `backports.shutil_get_terminal_size` on Python 2).

You can see the rest [on GitHub](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?q=milestone%3A4.2).

## IPython 4.1

IPython 4.1.2 (March, 2016) fixes installation issues with some versions of setuptools.

Released February, 2016. IPython 4.1 contains mostly bug fixes, though there are a few improvements.

  - IPython debugger (IPdb) now supports the number of context lines for the `where` (and `w`) commands. The <span class="title-ref">context</span> keyword is also available in various APIs. See PR `9097`
  - YouTube video will now show thumbnail when exported to a media that do not support video. (`9086`)
  - Add warning when running <span class="title-ref">ipython \<subcommand\></span> when subcommand is deprecated. <span class="title-ref">jupyter</span> should now be used.
  - Code in <span class="title-ref">%pinfo</span> (also known as <span class="title-ref">??</span>) are now highlighter (`8947`)
  - <span class="title-ref">%aimport</span> now support module completion. (`8884`)
  - <span class="title-ref">ipdb</span> output is now colored \! (`8842`)
  - Add ability to transpose columns for completion: (`8748`)

Many many docs improvements and bug fixes, you can see the [list of changes](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/compare/4.0.0...4.1.0)

## IPython 4.0

Released August, 2015

IPython 4.0 is the first major release after the Big Split. IPython no longer contains the notebook, qtconsole, etc. which have moved to [jupyter](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io). IPython subprojects, such as [IPython.parallel](https://ipyparallel.readthedocs.io) and [widgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io) have moved to their own repos as well.

The following subpackages are deprecated:

  - IPython.kernel (now jupyter\_client and ipykernel)
  - IPython.consoleapp (now jupyter\_client.consoleapp)
  - IPython.nbformat (now nbformat)
  - IPython.nbconvert (now nbconvert)
  - IPython.html (now notebook)
  - IPython.parallel (now ipyparallel)
  - IPython.utils.traitlets (now traitlets)
  - IPython.config (now traitlets.config)
  - IPython.qt (now qtconsole)
  - IPython.terminal.console (now jupyter\_console)

and a few other utilities.

Shims for the deprecated subpackages have been added, so existing code should continue to work with a warning about the new home.

There are few changes to the code beyond the reorganization and some bugfixes.

IPython highlights:

  - Public APIs for discovering IPython paths is moved from `IPython.utils.path` to `IPython.paths`. The old function locations continue to work with deprecation warnings.
  - Code raising `DeprecationWarning` entered by the user in an interactive session will now display the warning by default. See `8480` an `8478`.
  - The <span class="title-ref">--deep-reload</span> flag and the corresponding options to inject <span class="title-ref">dreload</span> or <span class="title-ref">reload</span> into the interactive namespace have been deprecated, and will be removed in future versions. You should now explicitly import <span class="title-ref">reload</span> from <span class="title-ref">IPython.lib.deepreload</span> to use it.

# 5.x Series

## IPython 5.8.0

  - Update inspecting function/methods for future-proofing. `11139`

## IPython 5.7

  - Fix IPython trying to import non-existing matplotlib backends `11087`
  - fix for display hook not publishing object metadata `11101`

## IPython 5.6

  - In Python 3.6 and above, dictionaries preserve the order items were added to them. On these versions, IPython will display dictionaries in their native order, rather than sorting by the keys (`10958`).
  - <span class="title-ref">\~.IPython.display.ProgressBar</span> can now be used as an iterator (`10813`).
  - The shell object gains a <span class="title-ref">\~.InteractiveShell.check\_complete</span> method, to allow a smoother transition to new input processing machinery planned for IPython 7 (`11044`).
  - IPython should start faster, as it no longer looks for all available pygments styles on startup (`10859`).

You can see all the PR marked for the [5.6. milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A5.6+is%3Aclosed+NOT+%22Backport+PR%22+), and all the [backport versions](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20milestone%3A5.6%20is%3Aclosed%20%22Backport%20PR%22%20).

## IPython 5.5

### System Wide config

  - IPython now looks for config files in `{sys.prefix}/etc/ipython` for environment-specific configuration.
  - Startup files can be found in `/etc/ipython/startup` or `{sys.prefix}/etc/ipython/startup` in addition to the profile directory, for system-wide or env-specific startup files.

See `10644`

### ProgressBar

IPython now has built-in support for progressbars:

    In[1]: from IPython.display import ProgressBar
    ...  : pb = ProgressBar(100)
    ...  : pb
    
    In[2]: pb.progress = 50
    
    # progress bar in cell 1 updates.

See `10755`

### Misc

>   - Fix `IPython.core.display:Pretty._repr_pretty_` had the wrong signature. (`10625`)
>   - `timeit` now give a correct `SyntaxError` if naked `return` used. (`10637`)
>   - Prepare the `:ipython:` directive to be compatible with Sphinx 1.7. (`10668`)
>   - Make IPython work with OpenSSL in FIPS mode; change hash algorithm of input from md5 to sha1. (`10696`)
>   - Clear breakpoints before running any script with debugger. (`10699`)
>   - Document that `profile` is deprecated, not to be confused with `prun`. (`10707`)
>   - Limit default number of returned completions to 500. (`10743`)

You can see all the PR marked for the [5.5. milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=is%3Apr%20milestone%3A5.5%20is%3Aclosed%20NOT%20%22Backport%20PR%22), and all the [backport versions](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20milestone%3A5.5%20is%3Aclosed%20%22Backport%20PR%22%20).

## IPython 5.4.1

Released a few hours after 5.4, fix a crash when `backports.shutil-get-terminal-size` is not installed. `10629`

## IPython 5.4

IPython 5.4-LTS is the first release of IPython after the release of the 6.x series which is Python 3 only. It backports most of the new exposed API additions made in IPython 6.0 and 6.1 and avoid having to write conditional logics depending of the version of IPython.

Please upgrade to pip 9 or greater before upgrading IPython. Failing to do so on Python 2 may lead to a broken IPython install.

### Configurable TerminalInteractiveShell

Backported from the 6.x branch as an exceptional new feature. See `10373` and `10364`

IPython gained a new `c.TerminalIPythonApp.interactive_shell_class` option that allow to customize the class used to start the terminal frontend. This should allow user to use custom interfaces, like reviving the former readline interface which is now a separate package not maintained by the core team.

### Define `_repr_mimebundle_`

Object can now define <span class="title-ref">\_repr\_mimebundle\_</span> in place of multiple <span class="title-ref">\_repr\_\*\_</span> methods and return a full mimebundle. This greatly simplify many implementation and allow to publish custom mimetypes (like geojson, plotly, dataframes....). See the `Custom Display Logic` example notebook for more information.

### Execution Heuristics

The heuristic for execution in the command line interface is now more biased toward executing for single statement. While in IPython 4.x and before a single line would be executed when enter is pressed, IPython 5.x would insert a new line. For single line statement this is not true anymore and if a single line is valid Python, IPython will execute it regardless of the cursor position. Use `Ctrl-O` to insert a new line. `10489`

### Implement Display IDs

Implement display id and ability to update a given display. This should greatly simplify a lot of code by removing the need for widgets and allow other frontend to implement things like progress-bars. See `10048`

### Display function

The <span class="title-ref">display() \<IPython.display.display\></span> function is now available by default in an IPython session, meaning users can call it on any object to see their rich representation. This should allow for better interactivity both at the REPL and in notebook environment.

Scripts and library that rely on display and may be run outside of IPython still need to import the display function using `from IPython.display import display`. See `10596`

### Miscs

  - `_mp_main_` is not reloaded which fixes issues with multiprocessing. `10523`
  - Use user colorscheme in Pdb as well `10479`
  - Faster shutdown. `10408`
  - Fix a crash in reverse search. `10371`
  - added `Completer.backslash_combining_completions` boolean option to deactivate backslash-tab completion that may conflict with windows path.

## IPython 5.3

Released on February 24th, 2017. Remarkable changes and fixes:

  - Fix a bug in `set_next_input` leading to a crash of terminal IPython. `10231`, `10296`, `10229`
  - Always wait for editor inputhook for terminal IPython `10239`, `10240`
  - Disable `_ipython_display_` in terminal `10249`, `10274`
  - Update terminal colors to be more visible by default on windows `10260`, `10238`, `10281`
  - Add Ctrl-Z shortcut (suspend) in terminal debugger `10254`, `10273`
  - Indent on new line by looking at the text before the cursor `10264`, `10275`, `9283`
  - Update QtEventloop integration to fix some matplotlib integration issues `10201`, `10311`, `10201`
  - Respect completions display style in terminal debugger `10305`, `10313`
  - Add a config option `TerminalInteractiveShell.extra_open_editor_shortcuts` to enable extra shortcuts to open the input in an editor. These are `v` in vi mode, and `C-X C-E` in emacs mode (`10330`). The `F2` shortcut is always enabled.

## IPython 5.2.2

  - Fix error when starting with `IPCompleter.limit_to__all__` configured.

## IPython 5.2.1

  - Fix tab completion in the debugger. `10223`

## IPython 5.2

Released on January 29th, 2017. Remarkable changes and fixes:

  - restore IPython's debugger to raise on quit. `10009`
  - The configuration value `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.highlighting_style` can now directly take a class argument for custom color style. `9848`
  - Correctly handle matplotlib figures dpi `9868`
  - Deprecate `-e` flag for the `%notebook` magic that had no effects. `9872`
  - You can now press F2 while typing at a terminal prompt to edit the contents in your favourite terminal editor. Set the `EDITOR` environment variable to pick which editor is used. `9929`
  - sdists will now only be `.tar.gz` as per upstream PyPI requirements. `9925`
  - `IPython.core.debugger` have gained a `set_trace()` method for convenience. `9947`
  - The 'smart command mode' added to the debugger in 5.0 was removed, as more people preferred the previous behaviour. Therefore, debugger commands such as `c` will act as debugger commands even when `c` is defined as a variable. `10050`
  - Fixes OS X event loop issues at startup, `10150`
  - Deprecate the `%autoindent` magic. `10176`
  - Emit a `DeprecationWarning` when setting the deprecated `limit_to_all` option of the completer. `10198`
  - The `capture` magic can now capture the result of a cell (from an expression on the last line), as well as printed and displayed output. `9851`.

Changes of behavior to `InteractiveShellEmbed`.

`InteractiveShellEmbed` interactive behavior have changed a bit in between 5.1 and 5.2. By default `%kill_embedded` magic will prevent further invocation of the current `call location` instead of preventing further invocation of the current instance creation location. For most use case this will not change much for you, though previous behavior was confusing and less consistent with previous IPython versions.

You can now deactivate instances by using `%kill_embedded --instance` flag, (or `-i` in short). The `%kill_embedded` magic also gained a `--yes`/`-y` option which skip confirmation step, and `-x`/`--exit` which also exit the current embedded call without asking for confirmation.

See `10207`.

## IPython 5.1

  - Broken `%timeit` on Python2 due to the use of `__qualname__`. `9804`
  - Restore `%gui qt` to create and return a `QApplication` if necessary. `9789`
  - Don't set terminal title by default. `9801`
  - Preserve indentation when inserting newlines with `Ctrl-O`. `9770`
  - Restore completion in debugger. `9785`
  - Deprecate `IPython.core.debugger.Tracer()` in favor of simpler, newer, APIs. `9731`
  - Restore `NoOpContext` context manager removed by mistake, and add <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span>. `9765`
  - Add option allowing `Prompt_toolkit` to use 24bits colors. `9736`
  - Fix for closing interactive matplotlib windows on OS X. `9854`
  - An embedded interactive shell instance can be used more than once. `9843`
  - More robust check for whether IPython is in a terminal. `9833`
  - Better pretty-printing of dicts on PyPy. `9827`
  - Some coloured output now looks better on dark background command prompts in Windows. `9838`
  - Improved tab completion of paths on Windows . `9826`
  - Fix tkinter event loop integration on Python 2 with `future` installed. `9824`
  - Restore `Ctrl-\` as a shortcut to quit IPython.
  - Make `get_ipython()` accessible when modules are imported by startup files. `9818`
  - Add support for running directories containing a `__main__.py` file with the `ipython` command. `9813`

### True Color feature

`prompt_toolkit` uses pygments styles for syntax highlighting. By default, the colors specified in the style are approximated using a standard 256-color palette. `prompt_toolkit` also supports 24bit, a.k.a. "true", a.k.a. 16-million color escape sequences which enable compatible terminals to display the exact colors specified instead of an approximation. This true\_color option exposes that capability in prompt\_toolkit to the IPython shell.

Here is a good source for the current state of true color support in various terminal emulators and software projects: <https://gist.github.com/XVilka/8346728>

## IPython 5.0

Released July 7, 2016

### New terminal interface

IPython 5 features a major upgrade to the terminal interface, bringing live syntax highlighting as you type, proper multiline editing and multiline paste, and tab completions that don't clutter up your history.

[![New terminal interface features](../_images/ptshell_features.png)](../_images/ptshell_features.png)

These features are provided by the Python library [prompt\_toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), which replaces `readline` throughout our terminal interface.

Relying on this pure-Python, cross platform module also makes it simpler to install IPython. We have removed dependencies on `pyreadline` for Windows and `gnureadline` for Mac.

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The `%install_ext` magic function, deprecated since 4.0, has now been deleted. You can distribute and install extensions as packages on PyPI.
  - Callbacks registered while an event is being handled will now only be called for subsequent events; previously they could be called for the current event. Similarly, callbacks removed while handling an event *will* always get that event. See `9447` and `9453`.
  - Integration with pydb has been removed since pydb development has been stopped since 2012, and pydb is not installable from PyPI.
  - The `autoedit_syntax` option has apparently been broken for many years. It has been removed.

#### New terminal interface

The overhaul of the terminal interface will probably cause a range of minor issues for existing users. This is inevitable for such a significant change, and we've done our best to minimise these issues. Some changes that we're aware of, with suggestions on how to handle them:

IPython no longer uses readline configuration (`~/.inputrc`). We hope that the functionality you want (e.g. vi input mode) will be available by configuring IPython directly (see \[/config/options/terminal\](/config/options/terminal.md)). If something's missing, please file an issue.

The `PromptManager` class has been removed, and the prompt machinery simplified. See \[custom\_prompts\](\#custom\_prompts) to customise prompts with the new machinery.

`IPython.core.debugger` now provides a plainer interface. `IPython.terminal.debugger` contains the terminal debugger using prompt\_toolkit.

There are new options to configure the colours used in syntax highlighting. We have tried to integrate them with our classic `--colors` option and `%colors` magic, but there's a mismatch in possibilities, so some configurations may produce unexpected results. See \[termcolour\](\#termcolour) for more information.

The new interface is not compatible with Emacs 'inferior-shell' feature. To continue using this, add the `--simple-prompt` flag to the command Emacs runs. This flag disables most IPython features, relying on Emacs to provide things like tab completion.

### Provisional Changes

Provisional changes are experimental functionality that may, or may not, make it into a future version of IPython, and which API may change without warnings. Activating these features and using these API are at your own risk, and may have security implication for your system, especially if used with the Jupyter notebook,

When running via the Jupyter notebook interfaces, or other compatible client, you can enable rich documentation experimental functionality:

When the `docrepr` package is installed setting the boolean flag `InteractiveShell.sphinxify_docstring` to `True`, will process the various object through sphinx before displaying them (see the `docrepr` package documentation for more information.

You need to also enable the IPython pager display rich HTML representation using the `InteractiveShell.enable_html_pager` boolean configuration option. As usual you can set these configuration options globally in your configuration files, alternatively you can turn them on dynamically using the following snippet:

`` `python     ip = get_ipython()     ip.sphinxify_docstring = True     ip.enable_html_pager = True   You can test the effect of various combinations of the above configuration in ``\` the Jupyter notebook, with things example like :

`` `ipython     import numpy as np     np.histogram?   This is part of an effort to make Documentation in Python richer and provide in ``\` the long term if possible dynamic examples that can contain math, images, widgets... As stated above this is nightly experimental feature with a lot of (fun) problem to solve. We would be happy to get your feedback and expertise on it.

### Deprecated Features

Some deprecated features are listed in this section. Don't forget to enable `DeprecationWarning` as an error if you are using IPython in a Continuous Integration setup or in your testing in general:

`` `python     import warnings     warnings.filterwarnings('error', '.*', DeprecationWarning, module='yourmodule.*')   - ``hooks.fix\_error\_editor`seems unused and is pending deprecation.`<span class="title-ref"> - \`IPython/core/excolors.py:ExceptionColors</span> is deprecated. - <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write()</span> is deprecated; use <span class="title-ref">sys.stdout</span> instead. - <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.InteractiveShell:write\_err()</span> is deprecated; use <span class="title-ref">sys.stderr</span> instead. - The <span class="title-ref">formatter</span> keyword argument to <span class="title-ref">Inspector.info</span> in <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.oinspec</span> has no effect. - The <span class="title-ref">global\_ns</span> keyword argument of IPython Embed was deprecated, and has no effect. Use <span class="title-ref">module</span> keyword argument instead.

### Known Issues:

  - `<Esc>` Key does not dismiss the completer and does not clear the current buffer. This is an on purpose modification due to current technical limitation. Cf `9572`. Escape the control character which is used for other shortcut, and there is no practical way to distinguish. Use Ctr-G or Ctrl-C as an alternative.
  - Cannot use `Shift-Enter` and `Ctrl-Enter` to submit code in terminal. cf `9587` and `9401`. In terminal there is no practical way to distinguish these key sequences from a normal new line return.
  - `PageUp` and `pageDown` do not move through completion menu.
  - Color styles might not adapt to terminal emulator themes. This will need new version of Pygments to be released, and can be mitigated with custom themes.

# 6.x Series

## IPython 6.5.0

Miscellaneous bug fixes and compatibility with Python 3.7.

  - Autocompletion fix for modules with out `__init__.py` `11227`
  - update the `%pastebin` magic to use `dpaste.com` instead og GitHub Gist which now requires authentication `11182`
  - Fix crash with multiprocessing `11185`

## IPython 6.4.0

Everything new in \[IPython 5.7 \<whatsnew570\>\](\#ipython-5.7-\<whatsnew570\>)

  - Fix display object not emitting metadata `11106`
  - Comments failing Jedi test `11110`

## IPython 6.3.1

This is a bugfix release to switch the default completions back to IPython's own completion machinery. We discovered some problems with the completions from Jedi, including completing column names on pandas data frames.

You can switch the completions source with the config option `Completer.use_jedi`.

## IPython 6.3

IPython 6.3 contains all the bug fixes and features in \[IPython 5.6 \<whatsnew560\>\](\#ipython-5.6-\<whatsnew560\>). In addition:

  - A new display class <span class="title-ref">IPython.display.Code</span> can be used to display syntax highlighted code in a notebook (`10978`).
  - The `html` magic now takes a `--isolated` option to put the content in an iframe (`10962`).
  - The code to find completions using the Jedi library has had various adjustments. This is still a work in progress, but we hope this version has fewer annoyances (`10956`, `10969`, `10999`, `11035`, `11063`, `11065`).
  - The *post* event callbacks are now always called, even when the execution failed (for example because of a `SyntaxError`).
  - The execution info and result objects are now made available in the corresponding *pre* or *post* `*_run_cell` \[event callbacks \</config/callbacks\>\](event callbacks \</config/callbacks\>.md) in a backward compatible manner (`10774` and `10795`).
  - Performance with very long code cells (hundreds of lines) is greatly improved (`10898`). Further improvements are planned for IPython 7.

You can see all [pull requests for the 6.3 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A6.3+is%3Aclosed).

## IPython 6.2

IPython 6.2 contains all the bugs fixes and features \[available in IPython 5.5 \<whatsnew550\>\](\#available-in-ipython-5.5-\<whatsnew550\>), like built in progress bar support, and system-wide configuration

The following features are specific to IPython 6.2:

### Function signature in completions

Terminal IPython will now show the signature of the function while completing. Only the currently highlighted function will show its signature on the line below the completer by default. This functionality is recent, so it might be limited; we welcome bug reports and requests for enhancements. `10507`

### Assignments return values

IPython can now trigger the display hook on the last assignment of cells. Up until 6.2 the following code wouldn't show the value of the assigned variable:

    In[1]: xyz = "something"
    # nothing shown

You would have to actually make it the last statement:

    In [2]: xyz = "something else"
    ...   : xyz
    Out[2]: "something else"

With the option `InteractiveShell.ast_node_interactivity='last_expr_or_assign'` you can now do:

    In [2]: xyz = "something else"
    Out[2]: "something else"

This option can be toggled at runtime with the `%config` magic, and will trigger on assignment `a = 1`, augmented assignment `+=`, `-=`, `|=` ... as well as type annotated assignments: `a:int = 2`.

See `10598`

### Recursive Call of ipdb

Advanced users of the debugger can now correctly recursively enter ipdb. This is thanks to `@segevfiner` on `10721`.

## IPython 6.1

  - Quotes in a filename are always escaped during tab-completion on non-Windows. `10069`

  - Variables now shadow magics in autocompletion. See `4877` and `10542`.

  - Added the ability to add parameters to alias\_magic. For example:
    
        In [2]: %alias_magic hist history --params "-l 2" --line
        Created `%hist` as an alias for `%history -l 2`.
        
        In [3]: hist
        %alias_magic hist history --params "-l 30" --line
        %alias_magic hist history --params "-l 2" --line
    
    Previously it was only possible to have an alias attached to a single function, and you would have to pass in the given parameters every time:
    
        In [4]: %alias_magic hist history --line
        Created `%hist` as an alias for `%history`.
        
        In [5]: hist -l 2
        hist
        %alias_magic hist history --line

  - To suppress log state messages, you can now either use `%logstart -q`, pass `--LoggingMagics.quiet=True` on the command line, or set `c.LoggingMagics.quiet=True` in your configuration file.

  - An additional flag `--TerminalInteractiveShell.term_title_format` is introduced to allow the user to control the format of the terminal title. It is specified as a python format string, and currently the only variable it will format is `{cwd}`.

  - `??`/`%pinfo2` will now show object docstrings if the source can't be retrieved. `10532`

  - `IPython.display` has gained a `%markdown` cell magic. `10563`

  - `%config` options can now be tab completed. `10555`

  - `%config` with no arguments are now unique and sorted. `10548`

  - Completion on keyword arguments does not duplicate `=` sign if already present. `10547`

  - `%run -m <module>` now `<module>` passes extra arguments to `<module>`. `10546`

  - completer now understand "snake case auto complete": if `foo_bar_kittens` is a valid completion, I can type `f_b<tab>` will complete to it. `10537`

  - tracebacks are better standardized and will compress <span class="title-ref">/path/to/home</span> to <span class="title-ref">\~</span>. `10515`

The following changes were also added to IPython 5.4, see \[what's new in IPython 5.4 \<whatsnew540\>\](\#what's-new-in-ipython-5.4-\<whatsnew540\>) for more detail description:

  - `TerminalInteractiveShell` is configurable and can be configured to (re)-use the readline interface.
  - objects can now define a `_repr_mimebundle_`
  - Execution heuristics improve for single line statements
  - `display()` can now return a display id to update display areas.

## IPython 6.0

Released April 19th, 2017

IPython 6 features a major improvement in the completion machinery which is now capable of completing non-executed code. It is also the first version of IPython to stop compatibility with Python 2, which is still supported on the bugfix only 5.x branch. Read below for a non-exhaustive list of new features.

Make sure you have pip \> 9.0 before upgrading. You should be able to update by using:

    pip install ipython --upgrade

\> **Note** \> If your pip version is greater than or equal to pip 9.0.1 you will automatically get the most recent version of IPython compatible with your system: on Python 2 you will get the latest IPython 5.x bugfix, while in Python 3 you will get the latest 6.x stable version.

### New completion API and Interface

The completer Completion API has seen an overhaul, and the new completer has plenty of improvements both from the end users of terminal IPython and for consumers of the API.

This new API is capable of pulling completions from `jedi`, thus allowing type inference on non-executed code. If `jedi` is installed, completions like the following are now possible without code evaluation:

> \>\>\> data = \['Number of users', 123\_456\] ... data\[0\].\<tab\>

That is to say, IPython is now capable of inferring that <span class="title-ref">data\[0\]</span> is a string, and will suggest completions like <span class="title-ref">.capitalize</span>. The completion power of IPython will increase with new Jedi releases, and a number of bug-fixes and more completions are already available on the development version of `jedi` if you are curious.

With the help of prompt toolkit, types of completions can be shown in the completer interface:

[![Jedi showing ability to do type inference](../_images/jedi_type_inference_60.png)](../_images/jedi_type_inference_60.png)

The appearance of the completer is controlled by the `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.display_completions` option that will show the type differently depending on the value among `'column'`, `'multicolumn'` and `'readlinelike'`

The use of Jedi also fulfills a number of requests and fixes a number of bugs like case-insensitive completion and completion after division operator: See `10182`.

Extra patches and updates will be needed to the `ipykernel` package for this feature to be available to other clients like Jupyter Notebook, Lab, Nteract, Hydrogen...

The use of Jedi should be barely noticeable on recent machines, but can be slower on older ones. To tweak the performance, the amount of time given to Jedi to compute type inference can be adjusted with `c.IPCompleter.jedi_compute_type_timeout`. The objects whose type were not inferred will be shown as `<unknown>`. Jedi can also be completely deactivated by using the `c.Completer.use_jedi=False` option.

The old `Completer.complete()` API is waiting deprecation and should be replaced replaced by `Completer.completions()` in the near future. Feedback on the current state of the API and suggestions are welcome.

### Python 3 only codebase

One of the large challenges in IPython 6.0 has been the adoption of a pure Python 3 codebase, which has led to upstream patches in pip, pypi and warehouse to make sure Python 2 systems still upgrade to the latest compatible Python version.

We remind our Python 2 users that IPython 5 is still compatible with Python 2.7, still maintained and will get regular releases. Using pip 9+, upgrading IPython will automatically upgrade to the latest version compatible with your system.

\> **Warning** \> If you are on a system using an older version of pip on Python 2, pip may still install IPython 6.0 on your system, and IPython will refuse to start. You can fix this by upgrading pip, and reinstalling ipython, or forcing pip to install an earlier version: `pip install 'ipython<6'`

The ability to use only Python 3 on the code base of IPython brings a number of advantages. Most of the newly written code make use of [optional function type annotation](https://peps.python.org/pep-0484/) leading to clearer code and better documentation.

The total size of the repository has also decreased by about 1500 lines (for the first time excluding the big split for 4.0). The decrease is potentially a bit more for the sour as some documents like this one are append only and are about 300 lines long.

The removal of the Python2/Python3 shim layer has made the code quite a lot clearer and more idiomatic in a number of locations, and much friendlier to work with and understand. We hope to further embrace Python 3 capabilities in the next release cycle and introduce more of the Python 3 only idioms (yield from, kwarg only, general unpacking) in the IPython code base, and see if we can take advantage of these to improve user experience with better error messages and hints.

### Configurable TerminalInteractiveShell, readline interface

IPython gained a new `c.TerminalIPythonApp.interactive_shell_class` option that allows customizing the class used to start the terminal frontend. This should allow a user to use custom interfaces, like reviving the former readline interface which is now a separate package not actively maintained by the core team. See the project to bring back the readline interface: [rlipython](https://github.com/ipython/rlipython).

This change will be backported to the IPython 5.x series.

### Misc improvements

  - The `capture` magic can now capture the result of a cell (from an expression on the last line), as well as printed and displayed output. `9851`.
  - Pressing Ctrl-Z in the terminal debugger now suspends IPython, as it already does in the main terminal prompt.
  - Autoreload can now reload `Enum`. See `10232` and `10316`
  - IPython.display has gained a `GeoJSON <IPython.display.GeoJSON>` object. `10288` and `10253`

#### Functions Deprecated in 6.x Development cycle

  - Loading extensions from `ipython_extension_dir` prints a warning that this location is pending deprecation. This should only affect users still having extensions installed with `%install_ext` which has been deprecated since IPython 4.0, and removed in 5.0. Extensions still present in `ipython_extension_dir` may shadow more recently installed versions using pip. It is thus recommended to clean `ipython_extension_dir` of any extension now available as a package.
  - `IPython.utils.warn` was deprecated in IPython 4.0, and has now been removed. instead of `IPython.utils.warn` inbuilt `warnings` module is used.
  - The function <span class="title-ref">IPython.core.oinspect.py:call\_tip</span> is unused, was marked as deprecated (raising a <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span>) and marked for later removal. `10104`

### Backward incompatible changes

#### Functions Removed in 6.x Development cycle

The following functions have been removed in the development cycle marked for Milestone 6.0.

  - `IPython/utils/process.py` - `is_cmd_found`
  - `IPython/utils/process.py` - `pycmd2argv`
  - The <span class="title-ref">--deep-reload</span> flag and the corresponding options to inject <span class="title-ref">dreload</span> or <span class="title-ref">reload</span> into the interactive namespace have been removed. You have to explicitly import <span class="title-ref">reload</span> from <span class="title-ref">IPython.lib.deepreload</span> to use it.
  - The `profile` used to print the current IPython profile, and which was deprecated in IPython 2.0 does now raise a <span class="title-ref">DeprecationWarning</span> error when used. It is often confused with the `prun` and the deprecation removal should free up the `profile` name in future versions.

# 7.x Series

## IPython 7.34

This version contains a single fix: fix uncaught BdbQuit exceptions on ipdb exit `13668`

## IPython 7.33

>   - Allow IPython hooks to receive current cell ids when frontend support it. See `13600`
>   - `?` does not trigger the insertion of a new cell anymore as most frontend allow proper multiline edition. `13625`

## IPython 7.32

### Autoload magic lazily

The ability to configure magics to be lazily loaded has been added to IPython. See the `ipython --help-all` section on `MagicsManager.lazy_magic`. One can now use:

    c.MagicsManager.lazy_magics = {
              "my_magic": "slow.to.import",
              "my_other_magic": "also.slow",
    }

And on first use of `%my_magic`, or corresponding cell magic, or other line magic, the corresponding `load_ext` will be called just before trying to invoke the magic.

### Misc

>   - Update sphinxify for Docrepr 0.2.0 `13503`.
>   - Set co\_name for cells run line by line (to fix debugging with Python 3.10) `13535`

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release. You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/99).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.31

IPython 7.31 brings a couple of backports and fixes from the 8.0 branches, it is likely one of the last releases of the 7.x series, as 8.0 will probably be released between this release and what would have been 7.32.

Please test 8.0 beta/rc releases in addition to this release.

  - This Releases:
    
      - Backport some fixes for Python 3.10 (`13412`)
      - use full-alpha transparency on dvipng rendered LaTeX (`13372`)

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release. You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/95).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.30

IPython 7.30 fixes a couple of bugs introduce in previous releases (in particular with respect to path handling), and introduce a few features and improvements:

Notably we will highlight `13267` "Document that `%run` can execute notebooks and ipy scripts.", which is the first commit of Fernando PÃ©rez since mid 2016 (IPython 5.1). If you are new to IPython, Fernando created IPython in 2001. The other most recent contribution of Fernando to IPython itself was May 2018, by reviewing and merging PRs. I want to note that Fernando is still active but mostly as a mentor and leader of the whole Jupyter organisation, but we're still happy to see him contribute code \!

`13290` "Use sphinxify (if available) in object\_inspect\_mime path" should allow richer Repr of docstrings when using jupyterlab inspector.

`13311` make the debugger use `ThreadPoolExecutor` for debugger cmdloop. This should fix some issues/infinite loop, but let us know if you come across any regressions. In particular this fixes issues with [kmaork/madbg](https://github.com/kmaork/madbg), a remote debugger for IPython.

Note that this is likely the ante-penultimate release of IPython 7.x as a stable branch, as I hope to release IPython 8.0 as well as IPython 7.31 next month/early 2022.

IPython 8.0 will drop support for Python 3.7, removed nose as a dependency, and 7.x will only get critical bug fixes with 8.x becoming the new stable. This will not be possible without [NumFOCUS Small Development Grants](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants) Which allowed us to hire [Nikita Kniazev](https://github.com/Kojoley) who provide Python and C++ help and contracting work.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release. You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/94?closed=1).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.29

IPython 7.29 brings a couple of new functionalities to IPython and a number of bugfixes. It is one of the largest recent release, relatively speaking, with close to 15 Pull Requests.

>   - fix an issue where base64 was returned instead of bytes when showing figures `13162`
>   - fix compatibility with PyQt6, PySide 6 `13172`. This may be of interest if you are running on Apple Silicon as only qt6.2+ is natively compatible.
>   - fix matplotlib qtagg eventloop `13179`
>   - Multiple docs fixes, typos, ... etc.
>   - Debugger will now exit by default on SigInt `13218`, this will be useful in notebook/lab if you forgot to exit the debugger. "Interrupt Kernel" will now exist the debugger.

It give Pdb the ability to skip code in decorators. If functions contain a special value names `__debuggerskip__ = True|False`, the function will not be stepped into, and Pdb will step into lower frames only if the value is set to `False`. The exact behavior is still likely to have corner cases and will be refined in subsequent releases. Feedback welcome. See the debugger module documentation for more info. Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for funding this feature.

The main branch of IPython is receiving a number of changes as we received a [NumFOCUS SDG](https://numfocus.org/programs/small-development-grants) ($4800), to help us finish replacing `nose` by `pytest`, and make IPython future proof with an 8.0 release.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release. You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/93).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.28

IPython 7.28 is again a minor release that mostly bring bugfixes, and couple of improvement. Many thanks to MrMino, who again did all the work this month, and made a number of documentation improvements.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of changes,

Fixes:

>   - async with doesn't allow newlines `13090`
>   - Dynamically changing to vi mode via %config magic) `13091`

Virtualenv handling fixes:

>   - init\_virtualenv now uses Pathlib `12548`
>   - Fix Improper path comparison of virtualenv directories `13140`
>   - Fix virtual environment user warning for lower case paths `13094`
>   - Adapt to all sorts of drive names for cygwin `13153`

New Features:

>   - enable autoplay in embed YouTube player `13133`
> 
> Documentation:
> 
>   - Fix formatting for the core.interactiveshell documentation `13118`
>   - Fix broken ipyparallel's refs `13138`
>   - Improve formatting of %time documentation `13125`
>   - Reword the YouTubeVideo autoplay WN `13147`

### Highlighted features

#### `YouTubeVideo` autoplay and the ability to add extra attributes to `IFrame`

You can add any extra attributes to the `<iframe>` tag using the new `extras` argument in the `IFrame` class. For example:

    In [1]: from IPython.display import IFrame
    
    In [2]: IFrame(src="src", width=300, height=300, extras=['loading="eager"'])

The above cells will result in the following HTML code being displayed in a notebook:

    <iframe
        width="300"
        height="300"
        src="src"
        frameborder="0"
        allowfullscreen
        loading="eager"
    ></iframe>

Related to the above, the `YouTubeVideo` class now takes an `allow_autoplay` flag, which sets up the iframe of the embedded YouTube video such that it allows autoplay.

<div class="note">

<div class="title">

Note

</div>

Whether this works depends on the autoplay policy of the browser rendering the HTML allowing it. It also could get blocked by some browser extensions.

</div>

Try it out\!

    In [1]: from IPython.display import YouTubeVideo
    
    In [2]: YouTubeVideo("dQw4w9WgXcQ", allow_autoplay=True)

## IPython 7.27

IPython 7.27 is a minor release that fixes a couple of issues and compatibility.

  - Add support for GTK4 `131011`
  - Add support for Qt6 `13085`
  - Fix an issue with pip magic on windows `13093`

## IPython 7.26

IPython 7.26 is a minor release that fixes a couple of issues, updates in API and Copyright/Licenses issues around various part of the codebase.

We'll highlight <span class="title-ref">this issue \<https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13039\></span> pointing out we were including and refereeing to code from Stack Overflow which was CC-BY-SA, hence incompatible with the BSD license of IPython. This lead us to a rewriting of the corresponding logic which in our case was done in a more efficient way (in our case we were searching string prefixes instead of full strings).

You will notice also a number of documentation improvements and cleanup.

Of particular interest are the following Pull-requests:

>   - The IPython directive now uses Sphinx logging for warnings. `13030`.
>   - Add expiry days option to pastebin magic and change http protocol to https. `13056`
>   - Make Ipython.utils.timing work with jupyterlite `13050`.

### Pastebin magic expiry days option

The Pastebin magic now has `-e` option to determine the number of days for paste expiration. For example the paste that created with `%pastebin -e 20 1` magic will be available for next 20 days.

### Thanks

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release and in particular MrMino who is doing most of the work those days. You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/90).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.25

IPython 7.25 is a minor release that contains a single bugfix, which is highly recommended for all users of ipdb, ipython debugger %debug magic and similar.

Issuing commands like `where` from within the debugger would reset the local variables changes made by the user. It is interesting to look at the root cause of the issue as accessing an attribute (`frame.f_locals`) would trigger this side effects.

Thanks in particular to the patience from the reporters at D.E. Shaw for their initial bug report that was due to a similar coding oversight in an extension, and who took time to debug and narrow down the problem.

## IPython 7.24

Third release of IPython for 2021, mostly containing bug fixes. A couple of not typical updates:

### Misc

>   - Fix an issue where `%recall` would both succeeded and print an error message it failed. `12952`
>   - Drop support for NumPy 1.16 â practically has no effect beyond indicating in package metadata that we do not support it. `12937`

### Debugger improvements

The debugger (and `%debug` magic) have been improved and can skip or hide frames originating from files that are not writable to the user, as these are less likely to be the source of errors, or be part of system files this can be a useful addition when debugging long errors.

In addition to the global `skip_hidden True|False` command, the debugger has gained finer grained control of predicates as to whether to a frame should be considered hidden. So far 3 predicates are available :

>   - `tbhide`: frames containing the local variable `__tracebackhide__` set to True.
>   - `readonly`: frames originating from readonly files, set to False.
>   - `ipython_internal`: frames that are likely to be from IPython internal code, set to True.

You can toggle individual predicates during a session with

    ipdb> skip_predicates readonly True

Read-only files will now be considered hidden frames.

You can call `skip_predicates` without arguments to see the states of current predicates:

    ipdb> skip_predicates
    current predicates:
        tbhide : True
        readonly : False
        ipython_internal : True

If all predicates are set to `False`, `skip_hidden` will practically have no effect. We attempt to warn you when all predicates are False.

Note that the `readonly` predicate may increase disk access as we check for file access permission for all frames on many command invocation, but is usually cached by operating systems. Let us know if you encounter any issues.

As the IPython debugger does not use the traitlets infrastructure for configuration, by editing your `.pdbrc` files and appending commands you would like to be executed just before entering the interactive prompt. For example:

    # file : ~/.pdbrc
    skip_predicates readonly True
    skip_predicates tbhide False

Will hide read only frames by default and show frames marked with `__tracebackhide__`.

## IPython 7.23 and 7.23.1

Third release of IPython for 2021, mostly containing bug fixes. A couple of not typical updates:

>   - We moved to GitHub actions away from Travis-CI, the transition may not be 100% complete (not testing on nightly anymore), but as we ran out of Travis-Ci hours on the IPython organisation that was a necessary step. `12900`.
>   - We have a new dependency: `matplotlib-inline`, which try to extract matplotlib inline backend specific behavior. It is available on PyPI and conda-forge thus should not be a problem to upgrade to this version. If you are a package maintainer that might be an extra dependency to package first. `12817` (IPython 7.23.1 fix a typo that made this change fail)

In the addition/new feature category, `display()` now have a `clear=True` option to clear the display if any further outputs arrives, allowing users to avoid having to use `clear_output()` directly. `12823`.

In bug fixes category, this release fix an issue when printing tracebacks containing Unicode characters `12758`.

In code cleanup category `12932` remove usage of some deprecated functionality for compatibility with Python 3.10.

### Thanks

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release you can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/86). In particular MrMino for responding to almost all new issues, and triaging many of the old ones, as well as takluyver, minrk, willingc for reacting quikly when we ran out of CI Hours.

Thanks as well to organisations, QuantStack (martinRenou and SylvainCorlay) for extracting matplotlib inline backend into its own package, and the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.22

Second release of IPython for 2021, mostly containing bug fixes. Here is a quick rundown of the few changes.

  - Fix some `sys.excepthook` shenanigan when embedding with qt, recommended if you â for example â use [napari](https://napari.org). `12842`.
  - Fix bug when using the new ipdb `%context` magic `12844`
  - Couples of deprecation cleanup `12868`
  - Update for new dpast.com api if you use the `%pastbin` magic. `12712`
  - Remove support for numpy before 1.16. `12836`

### Thanks

We have a new team member that you should see more often on the IPython repository, BÅaÅ¼ej Michalik (@MrMino) have been doing regular contributions to IPython, and spent time replying to many issues and guiding new users to the codebase; they now have triage permissions to the IPython repository and we'll work toward giving them more permission in the future.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release you can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/84).

Thanks as well to organisations, QuantStack for working on debugger compatibility for Xeus\_python, and the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 7.21

IPython 7.21 is the first release we have back on schedule of one release every month; it contains a number of minor fixes and improvements, notably, the new context command for ipdb

### New "context" command in ipdb

It is now possible to change the number of lines shown in the backtrace information in ipdb using "context" command. `12826`

(thanks @MrMino, there are other improvement from them on master).

### Other notable changes in IPython 7.21

  - Fix some issues on new osx-arm64 `12804`, `12807`.
  - Compatibility with Xeus-Python for debugger protocol, `12809`
  - Misc docs fixes for compatibility and uniformity with Numpydoc. `12824`

### Thanks

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release you can find all individual contribution to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/83).

## IPython 7.20

IPython 7.20 is the accumulation of 3 month of work on IPython, spacing between IPython release have been increased from the usual once a month for various reason.

>   - Mainly as I'm too busy and the effectively sole maintainer, and
>   - Second because not much changes happened before mid December.

The main driver for this release was the new version of Jedi 0.18 breaking API; which was taken care of in the master branch early in 2020 but not in 7.x as I though that by now 8.0 would be out.

The inclusion of a resolver in pip did not help and actually made things worse. If usually I would have simply pinned Jedi to `<0.18`; this is not a solution anymore as now pip is free to install Jedi 0.18, and downgrade IPython.

I'll do my best to keep the regular release, but as the 8.0-dev branch and 7.x are starting to diverge this is becoming difficult in particular with my limited time, so if you have any cycles to spare I'll appreciate your help to respond to issues and pushing 8.0 forward.

Here are thus some of the changes for IPython 7.20.

>   - Support for PyQt5 \>= 5.11 `12715`
>   - `%reset` remove imports more aggressively `12718`
>   - fix the `%conda` magic `12739`
>   - compatibility with Jedi 0.18, and bump minimum Jedi version. `12793`

## IPython 7.19

IPython 7.19 accumulative two month of works, bug fixes and improvements, there was exceptionally no release last month.

>   - Fix to restore the ability to specify more than one extension using command line flags when using traitlets 5.0 `12543`
>   - Docs docs formatting that make the install commands work on zsh `12587`
>   - Always display the last frame in tracebacks even if hidden with `__tracebackhide__` `12601`
>   - Avoid an issue where a callback can be registered multiple times. `12625`
>   - Avoid an issue in debugger mode where frames changes could be lost. `12627`
>   - Never hide the frames that invoke a debugger, even if marked as hidden by `__tracebackhide__` `12631`
>   - Fix calling the debugger in a recursive manner `12659`

A number of code changes have landed on master and we are getting close to enough new features and codebase improvement that a 8.0 start to make sens. For downstream packages, please start working on migrating downstream testing away from iptest and using pytest, as nose will not work on Python 3.10 and we will likely start removing it as a dependency for testing.

## IPython 7.18

IPython 7.18 is a minor release that mostly contains bugfixes.

>   - `CRLF` is now handled by magics my default; solving some issues due to copy pasting on windows. `12475`
>   - Requiring pexpect `>=4.3` as we are Python 3.7+ only and earlier version of pexpect will be incompatible. `12510`
>   - Minimum jedi version is now 0.16. `12488`

## IPython 7.17

IPython 7.17 brings a couple of new improvements to API and a couple of user facing changes to make the terminal experience more user friendly.

`12407` introduces the ability to pass extra argument to the IPython debugger class; this is to help a new project from `kmaork` (<https://github.com/kmaork/madbg>) to feature a fully remote debugger.

`12410` finally remove support for 3.6, while the codebase is still technically compatible; IPython will not install on Python 3.6.

lots of work on the debugger and hidden frames from `@impact27` in `12437`, `12445`, `12460` and in particular `12453` which make the debug magic more robust at handling spaces.

Biggest API addition is code transformation which is done before code execution; IPython allows a number of hooks to catch non-valid Python syntax (magic, prompt stripping...etc). Transformers are usually called many time; typically:

>   - When trying to figure out whether the code is complete and valid (should we insert a new line or execute ?)
>   - During actual code execution pass before giving the code to Python's `exec`.

This lead to issues when transformer might have had side effects; or do external queries. Starting with IPython 7.17 you can expect your transformer to be called less time.

Input transformers are now called only once in the execution path of <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShell</span>, allowing to register transformer that potentially have side effects (note that this is not recommended). Internal methods <span class="title-ref">should\_run\_async</span>, and <span class="title-ref">run\_cell\_async</span> now take a recommended optional <span class="title-ref">transformed\_cell</span>, and <span class="title-ref">preprocessing\_exc\_tuple</span> parameters that will become mandatory at some point in the future; that is to say cells need to be explicitly transformed to be valid Python syntax ahead of trying to run them. `12440`;

`input_transformers` can now also have an attribute `has_side_effects` set to <span class="title-ref">True</span>, when this attribute is present; this will prevent the transformers from being ran when IPython is trying to guess whether the user input is complete. Note that this may means you will need to explicitly execute in some case where your transformations are now not ran; but will not affect users with no custom extensions.

>     - IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_cell_async(self, raw_cell, store_history=False, silent=False, shell_futures=True)
>     + IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.run_cell_async(self, raw_cell, store_history=False, silent=False, shell_futures=True, *, transformed_cell=None, preprocessing_exc_tuple=None)

>     - IPython.terminal.debugger.TerminalPdb.pt_init(self)
>     + IPython.terminal.debugger.TerminalPdb.pt_init(self, pt_session_options=None)

This method was added:

    + IPython.core.interactiveshell.InteractiveShell.get_local_scope

Which is now also present on subclasses:

    + IPython.terminal.embed.InteractiveShellEmbed.get_local_scope
    + IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.TerminalInteractiveShell.get_local_scope

## IPython 7.16.1, 7.16.2

IPython 7.16.1 was release immediately after 7.16.0 to fix a conda packaging issue. The source is identical to 7.16.0 but the file permissions in the tar are different.

IPython 7.16.2 pins jedi dependency to "\<=0.17.2" which should prevent some issues for users still on python 3.6. This may not be sufficient as pip may still allow to downgrade IPython.

Compatibility with Jedi \> 0.17.2 was not added as this would have meant bumping the minimal version to \>0.16.

## IPython 7.16

The default traceback mode will now skip frames that are marked with `__tracebackhide__ = True` and show how many traceback frames have been skipped. This can be toggled by using `xmode` with the `--show` or `--hide` attribute. It will have no effect on non verbose traceback modes.

The ipython debugger also now understands `__tracebackhide__` as well and will skip hidden frames when displaying. Movement up and down the stack will skip the hidden frames and will show how many frames were hidden. Internal IPython frames are also now hidden by default. The behavior can be changed with the `skip_hidden` while in the debugger, command and accepts "yes", "no", "true" and "false" case insensitive parameters.

### Misc Noticeable changes:

  - Exceptions are now (re)raised when running notebooks via the `%run`, helping to catch issues in workflows and pipelines. `12301`
  - Fix inputhook for qt 5.15.0 `12355`
  - Fix wx inputhook `12375`
  - Add handling for malformed pathext env var (Windows) `12367`
  - use $SHELL in system\_piped `12360` for uniform behavior with ipykernel.

### Reproducible Build

IPython 7.15 reproducible build did not work, so we try again this month `12358`.

### API Changes

Change of API and exposed objects automatically detected using [frappuccino](https://pypi.org/project/frappuccino/) (still in beta):

The following items are new and mostly related to understanding `__tracebackhide__`:

    + IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.do_down(self, arg)
    + IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.do_skip_hidden(self, arg)
    + IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.do_up(self, arg)
    + IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.hidden_frames(self, stack)
    + IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.stop_here(self, frame)

The following items have been removed:

    - IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.new_do_down
    - IPython.core.debugger.Pdb.new_do_up

Those were implementation details.

## IPython 7.15

IPython 7.15 brings a number of bug fixes and user facing improvements.

### Misc Noticeable changes:

>   - Long completion name have better elision in terminal `12284`
>   - I've started to test on Python 3.9 `12307` and fix some errors.
>   - Hi DPI scaling of figures when using qt eventloop `12314`
>   - Document the ability to have systemwide configuration for IPython. `12328`
>   - Fix issues with input autoformatting `12336`
>   - `IPython.core.debugger.Pdb` is now interruptible (`12168`, in 7.14 but forgotten in release notes)
>   - Video HTML attributes (`12212`, in 7.14 but forgotten in release notes)

### Reproducible Build

Starting with IPython 7.15, I am attempting to provide reproducible builds, that is to say you should be able from the source tree to generate an sdist and wheel that are identical byte for byte with the publish version on PyPI.

I've only tested on a couple of machines so far and the process is relatively straightforward, so this mean that IPython not only have a deterministic build process, but also I have either removed, or put under control all effects of the build environments on the final artifact. I encourage you to attempt the build process on your machine as documented in \[core\_developer\_guide\](\#core\_developer\_guide) and let me know if you do not obtain an identical artifact.

While reproducible builds is critical to check that the supply chain of (open source) software has not been compromised, it can also help to speedup many of the build processes in large environment (conda, apt...) by allowing better caching of intermediate build steps.

Learn more on <https://reproducible-builds.org/>. [Reflections on trusting trust](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/358198.358210) is also one of the cornerstone and recommended reads on this subject.

\> **Note** \> The build commit from which the sdist is generated is also [signed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_signature), so you should be able to check it has not been compromised, and the git repository is a [merkle-tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree), you can check the consistency with [git-fsck](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-fsck) which you likely [want to enable by default](https://gist.github.com/mbbx6spp/14b86437e794bffb4120).

### NEP29: Last version to support Python 3.6

IPython 7.15 will be the Last IPython version to officially support Python 3.6, as stated by [NumPy Enhancement Proposal 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html). Starting with next minor version of IPython I may stop testing on Python 3.6 and may stop publishing release artifacts that install on Python 3.6

### Highlighted features

Highlighted features are not new, but seem to not be widely known, this section will help you discover in more narrative form what you can do with IPython.

#### Increase Tab Completion Menu Height

In terminal IPython it is possible to increase the height of the tab-completion menu. To do so set the value of `TerminalInteractiveShell.space_for_menu`, this will reserve more space at the bottom of the screen for various kind of menus in IPython including tab completion and searching in history.

#### Autoformat Code in the terminal

If you have a preferred code formatter, you can configure IPython to reformat your code. Set the value of `TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter` to for example `'black'` and IPython will auto format your code when possible.

## IPython 7.14

IPython 7.14 is a minor release that fix a couple of bugs and prepare compatibility with new or future versions of some libraries.

### Important changes:

>   - Fix compatibility with Sphinx 3+ `12235`
>   - Remove deprecated matplotlib parameter usage, compatibility with matplotlib 3.3+ :<span class="title-ref">122250</span>

### Misc Changes

>   - set `.py` extension when editing current buffer in vi/emacs. `12167`
>   - support for unicode identifiers in `?`/`??` `12208`
>   - add extra options to the `Video` Rich objects `12212`
>   - add pretty-printing to `SimpleNamespace` `12230`

### IPython.core.debugger.Pdb is now interruptible

A `KeyboardInterrupt` will now interrupt IPython's extended debugger, in order to make Jupyter able to interrupt it. (`12168`)

### Video HTML attributes

Add an option to <span class="title-ref">IPython.display.Video</span> to change the attributes of the HTML display of the video (`12212`)

### Pending deprecated imports

Many object present in `IPython.core.display` are there for internal use only, and should already been imported from `IPython.display` by users and external libraries. Trying to import those from `IPython.core.display` is still possible but will trigger a deprecation warning in later versions of IPython and will become errors in the future.

This will simplify compatibility with other Python kernels (like Xeus-Python), and simplify code base.

## IPython 7.13

IPython 7.13 is the final release of the 7.x branch since master is diverging toward an 8.0. Exiting new features have already been merged in 8.0 and will not be available on the 7.x branch. All the changes below have been backported from the master branch.

>   - Fix inability to run PDB when inside an event loop `12141`
>   - Fix ability to interrupt some processes on windows `12137`
>   - Fix debugger shortcuts `12132`
>   - improve tab completion when inside a string by removing irrelevant elements `12128`
>   - Fix display of filename tab completion when the path is long `12122`
>   - Many removal of Python 2 specific code path `12110`
>   - displaying wav files do not require NumPy anymore, and is 5x to 30x faster `12113`

See the list of all closed issues and pull request on [github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A7.13).

## IPython 7.12

IPython 7.12 is a minor update that mostly brings code cleanup, removal of longtime deprecated function and a couple update to documentation cleanup as well.

Notable changes are the following:

>   - Exit non-zero when ipython is given a file path to run that doesn't exist `12074`
>   - Test PR on ARM64 with Travis-CI `12073`
>   - Update CI to work with latest Pytest `12086`
>   - Add infrastructure to run ipykernel eventloop via trio `12097`
>   - Support git blame ignore revs `12091`
>   - Start multi-line `__repr__` s on their own line `12099`

## IPython 7.11.1

A couple of deprecated functions (no-op) have been reintroduces in py3compat as Cython was still relying on them, and will be removed in a couple of versions.

## IPython 7.11

IPython 7.11 received a couple of compatibility fixes and code cleanup.

A number of function in the `py3compat` have been removed; a number of types in the IPython code base are now non-ambiguous and now always `unicode` instead of `Union[Unicode,bytes]`; many of the relevant code path have thus been simplified/cleaned and types annotation added.

IPython support several verbosity level from exceptions. `xmode plain` now support chained exceptions. `11999`

We are starting to remove `shell=True` in some usages of subprocess. While not directly a security issue (as IPython is made to run arbitrary code anyway) it is not good practice and we'd like to show the example. `12023`. This discussion was started by `@mschwager` thanks to a new auditing tool they are working on with duo-labs ([dlint](https://github.com/duo-labs/dlint)).

Work around some bugs in Python 3.9 tokenizer `12057`

IPython will now print its version after a crash. `11986`

This is likely the last release from the 7.x series that will see new feature. The master branch will soon accept large code changes and thrilling new features; the 7.x branch will only start to accept critical bug fixes, and update dependencies.

## IPython 7.10.2

IPython 7.10.2 fix a couple of extra incompatibility between IPython, ipdb, asyncio and Prompt Toolkit 3.

## IPython 7.10.1

IPython 7.10.1 fix a couple of incompatibilities with Prompt toolkit 3 (please update Prompt toolkit to 3.0.2 at least), and fixes some interaction with headless IPython.

## IPython 7.10.0

IPython 7.10 is the first double digit minor release in the last decade, and first since the release of IPython 1.0, previous double digit minor release was in August 2009.

We've been trying to give you regular release on the last Friday of every month for a guaranty of rapid access to bug fixes and new features.

Unlike the previous first few releases that have seen only a couple of code changes, 7.10 bring a number of changes, new features and bugfixes.

### Stop Support for Python 3.5 â Adopt NEP 29

IPython has decided to follow the informational [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html) which layout a clear policy as to which version of (C)Python and NumPy are supported.

We thus dropped support for Python 3.5, and cleaned up a number of code path that were Python-version dependent. If you are on 3.5 or earlier pip should automatically give you the latest compatible version of IPython so you do not need to pin to a given version.

### Support for Prompt Toolkit 3.0

Prompt Toolkit 3.0 was release a week before IPython 7.10 and introduces a few breaking changes. We believe IPython 7.10 should be compatible with both Prompt Toolkit 2.x and 3.x, though it has not been extensively tested with 3.x so please report any issues.

### Prompt Rendering Performance improvements

Pull Request `11933` introduced an optimisation in the prompt rendering logic that should decrease the resource usage of IPython when using the \_[default]() configuration but could potentially introduce a regression of functionalities if you are using a custom prompt.

We know assume if you haven't changed the default keybindings that the prompt **will not change** during the duration of your input â which is for example not true when using vi insert mode that switches between <span class="title-ref">\[ins\]</span> and <span class="title-ref">\[nor\]</span> for the current mode.

If you are experiencing any issue let us know.

### Code autoformatting

The IPython terminal can now auto format your code just before entering a new line or executing a command. To do so use the `--TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter` option and set it to `'black'`; if black is installed IPython will use black to format your code when possible.

IPython cannot always properly format your code; in particular it will auto formatting with *black* will only work if:

>   - Your code does not contains magics or special python syntax.
>   - There is no code after your cursor.

The Black API is also still in motion; so this may not work with all versions of black.

It should be possible to register custom formatter, though the API is till in flux.

### Arbitrary Mimetypes Handing in Terminal (Aka inline images in terminal)

When using IPython terminal it is now possible to register function to handle arbitrary mimetypes. While rendering non-text based representation was possible in many jupyter frontend; it was not possible in terminal IPython, as usually terminal are limited to displaying text. As many terminal these days provide escape sequences to display non-text; bringing this loved feature to IPython CLI made a lot of sens. This functionality will not only allow inline images; but allow opening of external program; for example `mplayer` to "display" sound files.

So far only the hooks necessary for this are in place, but no default mime renderers added; so inline images will only be available via extensions. We will progressively enable these features by default in the next few releases, and contribution is welcomed.

We welcome any feedback on the API. See \[shell\_mimerenderer\](\#shell\_mimerenderer) for more information.

This is originally based on work form in `10610` from @stephanh42 started over two years ago, and still a lot need to be done.

### MISC

>   - Completions can define their own ordering `11855`
>   - Enable Plotting in the same cell than the one that import matplotlib `11916`
>   - Allow to store and restore multiple variables at once `11930`

You can see [all pull-requests](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=is%3Apr+milestone%3A7.10+is%3Aclosed) for this release.

### API Changes

Change of API and exposed objects automatically detected using [frappuccino](https://pypi.org/project/frappuccino/) (still in beta):

The following items are new in IPython 7.10:

    + IPython.terminal.shortcuts.reformat_text_before_cursor(buffer, document, shell)
    + IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.PTK3
    + IPython.terminal.interactiveshell.black_reformat_handler(text_before_cursor)
    + IPython.terminal.prompts.RichPromptDisplayHook.write_format_data(self, format_dict, md_dict='None')

The following items have been removed in 7.10:

    - IPython.lib.pretty.DICT_IS_ORDERED

The following signatures differ between versions:

    - IPython.extensions.storemagic.restore_aliases(ip)
    + IPython.extensions.storemagic.restore_aliases(ip, alias='None')

### Special Thanks

>   - @stephanh42 who started the work on inline images in terminal 2 years ago
>   - @augustogoulart who spent a lot of time triaging issues and responding to users.
>   - @con-f-use who is my (@Carreau) first sponsor on GitHub, as a reminder if you like IPython, Jupyter and many other library of the SciPy stack you can donate to numfocus.org non profit

## IPython 7.9.0

IPython 7.9 is a small release with a couple of improvement and bug fixes.

>   - Xterm terminal title should be restored on exit `11910`
>   - special variables `_`,`__`, `___` are not set anymore when cache size is 0 or less. `11877`
>   - Autoreload should have regained some speed by using a new heuristic logic to find all objects needing reload. This should avoid large objects traversal like pandas dataframes. `11876`
>   - Get ready for Python 4. `11874`
>   - <span class="title-ref">%env</span> Magic now has heuristic to hide potentially sensitive values `11896`

This is a small release despite a number of Pull Request Pending that need to be reviewed/worked on. Many of the core developers have been busy outside of IPython/Jupyter and we thanks all contributor for their patience; we'll work on these as soon as we have time.

## IPython 7.8.0

IPython 7.8.0 contain a few bugfix and 2 new APIs:

>   - Enable changing the font color for LaTeX rendering `11840`
>   - and Re-Expose some PDB API (see below)

### Expose Pdb API

Expose the built-in `pdb.Pdb` API. `Pdb` constructor arguments are generically exposed, regardless of python version. Newly exposed arguments:

  - `skip` - Python 3.1+
  - `nosiginnt` - Python 3.2+
  - `readrc` - Python 3.6+

Try it out:

    from IPython.terminal.debugger import TerminalPdb
    pdb = TerminalPdb(skip=["skipthismodule"])

See `11840`

## IPython 7.7.0

IPython 7.7.0 contain multiple bug fixes and documentation updates; Here are a few of the outstanding issue fixed:

>   - Fix a bug introduced in 7.6 where the `%matplotlib` magic would fail on previously acceptable arguments `11814`.
>   - Fix the manage location on freebsd `11808`.
>   - Fix error message about aliases after `%reset` call in ipykernel `11806`
>   - Fix Duplication completions in emacs `11803`

We are planning to adopt [NEP29](https://github.com/numpy/numpy/pull/14086) (still currently in draft) which may make this minor version of IPython the last one to support Python 3.5 and will make the code base more aggressive toward removing compatibility with older versions of Python.

GitHub now support to give only "Triage" permissions to users; if you'd like to help close stale issues and labels issues please reach to us with your GitHub Username and we'll add you to the triage team. It is a great way to start contributing and a path toward getting commit rights.

## IPython 7.6.1

IPython 7.6.1 contain a critical bugfix in the `%timeit` magic, which would crash on some inputs as a side effect of `11716`. See `11812`

## IPython 7.6.0

IPython 7.6.0 contains a couple of bug fixes and number of small features additions as well as some compatibility with the current development version of Python 3.8.

>   - Add a `-l` option to `psearch` to list the available search types. `11672`
>   - Support `PathLike` for `DisplayObject` and `Image`. `11764`
>   - Configurability of timeout in the test suite for slow platforms. `11756`
>   - Accept any casing for matplotlib backend. `121748`
>   - Properly skip test that requires numpy to be installed `11723`
>   - More support for Python 3.8 and positional only arguments (pep570) `11720`
>   - Unicode names for the completion are loaded lazily on first use which should decrease startup time. `11693`
>   - Autoreload now update the types of reloaded objects; this for example allow pickling of reloaded objects. `11644`
>   - Fix a bug where `%%time` magic would suppress cell output. `11716`

### Prepare migration to pytest (instead of nose) for testing

Most of the work between 7.5 and 7.6 was to prepare the migration from our testing framework to pytest. Most of the test suite should now work by simply issuing `pytest` from the root of the repository.

The migration to pytest is just at its beginning. Many of our test still rely on IPython-specific plugins for nose using pytest (doctest using IPython syntax is one example of this where test appear as "passing", while no code has been ran). Many test also need to be updated like `yield-test` to be properly parametrized tests.

Migration to pytest allowed me to discover a number of issues in our test suite; which was hiding a number of subtle issues âÂ or not actually running some of the tests in our test suite â I have thus corrected many of those; like improperly closed resources; or used of deprecated features. I also made use of the `pytest --durations=...` to find some of our slowest test and speed them up (our test suite can now be up to 10% faster). Pytest as also a variety of plugins and flags which will make the code quality of IPython and the testing experience better.

### Misc

We skipped the release of 7.6 at the end of May, but will attempt to get back on schedule. We are starting to think about making introducing backward incompatible change and start the 8.0 series.

Special Thanks to Gabriel (@gpotter2 on GitHub), who among other took care many of the remaining task for 7.4 and 7.5, like updating the website.

## IPython 7.5.0

IPython 7.5.0 consist mostly of bug-fixes, and documentation updates, with one minor new feature. The <span class="title-ref">Audio</span> display element can now be assigned an element id when displayed in browser. See `11670`

The major outstanding bug fix correct a change of behavior that was introduce in 7.4.0 where some cell magics would not be able to access or modify global scope when using the `@needs_local_scope` decorator. This was typically encountered with the `%%time` and `%%timeit` magics. See `11659` and `11698`.

## IPython 7.4.0

### Unicode name completions

Previously, we provided completion for a unicode name with its relative symbol. With this, now IPython provides complete suggestions to unicode name symbols.

As on the PR, if user types `\LAT<tab>`, IPython provides a list of possible completions. In this case, it would be something like:

    'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER A',
    'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER B',
    'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER C',
    'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER D',
    ....

This help to type unicode character that do not have short latex aliases, and have long unicode names. for example `Í°`, `\GREEK CAPITAL LETTER HETA`.

This feature was contributed by Luciana Marques `11583`.

### Make audio normalization optional

Added 'normalize' argument to <span class="title-ref">IPython.display.Audio</span>. This argument applies when audio data is given as an array of samples. The default of <span class="title-ref">normalize=True</span> preserves prior behavior of normalizing the audio to the maximum possible range. Setting to <span class="title-ref">False</span> disables normalization.

### Miscellaneous

>   - Fix improper acceptation of `return` outside of functions. `11641`.
>   - Fixed PyQt 5.11 backwards incompatibility causing sip import failure. `11613`.
>   - Fix Bug where `type?` would crash IPython. `1608`.
>   - Allow to apply `@needs_local_scope` to cell magics for convenience. `11542`.

## IPython 7.3.0

IPython 7.3.0 bring several bug fixes and small improvements that you will described below.

The biggest change to this release is the implementation of the `%conda` and `%pip` magics, that will attempt to install packages in the **current environment**. You may still need to restart your interpreter or kernel for the change to be taken into account, but it should simplify installation of packages into remote environment. Installing using pip/conda from the command line is still the prefer method.

The `%pip` magic was already present, but was only printing a warning; now it will actually forward commands to pip.

Misc bug fixes and improvements:

>   - Compatibility with Python 3.8.
>   - Do not expand shell variable in execution magics, and added the `no_var_expand` decorator for magic requiring a similar functionality `11516`
>   - Add `%pip` and `%conda` magic `11524`
>   - Re-initialize posix aliases after a `%reset` `11528`
>   - Allow the IPython command line to run `*.ipynb` files `11529`

## IPython 7.2.0

IPython 7.2.0 brings minor bugfixes, improvements, and new configuration options:

>   - Fix a bug preventing PySide2 GUI integration from working `11464`
>   - Run CI on Mac OS \! `11471`
>   - Fix IPython "Demo" mode. `11498`
>   - Fix `%run` magic with path in name `11499`
>   - Fix: add CWD to sys.path *after* stdlib `11502`
>   - Better rendering of signatures, especially long ones. `11505`
>   - Re-enable jedi by default if it's installed `11506`
>   - Add New `minimal` exception reporting mode (useful for educational purpose). See `11509`

### Added ability to show subclasses when using pinfo and other utilities

When using `?`/`??` on a class, IPython will now list the first 10 subclasses.

Special Thanks to Chris Mentzel of the Moore Foundation for this feature. Chris is one of the people who played a critical role in IPython/Jupyter getting funding.

We are grateful for all the help Chris has given us over the years, and we're now proud to have code contributed by Chris in IPython.

### OSMagics.cd\_force\_quiet configuration option

You can set this option to force the %cd magic to behave as if `-q` was passed:

    In [1]: cd /
    /
    
    In [2]: %config OSMagics.cd_force_quiet = True
    
    In [3]: cd /tmp
    
    In [4]:

See `11491`

### In vi editing mode, whether the prompt includes the current vi mode can now be configured

Set the `TerminalInteractiveShell.prompt_includes_vi_mode` to a boolean value (default: True) to control this feature. See `11492`

## IPython 7.1.0

IPython 7.1.0 is the first minor release after 7.0.0 and mostly brings fixes to new features, internal refactoring, and fixes for regressions that happened during the 6.x-\>7.x transition. It also brings **Compatibility with Python 3.7.1**, as we're unwillingly relying on a bug in CPython.

New Core Dev:

>   - We welcome Jonathan Slenders to the committers. Jonathan has done a fantastic work on prompt\_toolkit, and we'd like to recognise his impact by giving him commit rights. `11397`

Notable Changes

>   - Major update of "latex to unicode" tab completion map (see below)

Notable New Features:

>   - Restore functionality and documentation of the **sphinx directive**, which is now stricter (fail on error by daefault), has new configuration options, has a brand new documentation page \[ipython\_directive\](\#ipython\_directive) (which needs some cleanup). It is also now *tested* so we hope to have less regressions. `11402`
>   - `IPython.display.Video` now supports `width` and `height` arguments, allowing a custom width and height to be set instead of using the video's width and height. `11353`
>   - Warn when using `HTML('<iframe>')` instead of `IFrame` `11350`
>   - Allow Dynamic switching of editing mode between vi/emacs and show normal/input mode in prompt when using vi. `11390`. Use `%config TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'vi'` or `%config TerminalInteractiveShell.editing_mode = 'emacs'` to dynamically switch between modes.

Notable Fixes:

>   - Fix entering of **multi-line blocks in terminal** IPython, and various crashes in the new input transformation machinery `11354`, `11356`, `11358`. These also fix a **Compatibility bug with Python 3.7.1**.

Many thanks to all the contributors and in particular to `bartskowron` and `tonyfast` who handled some pretty complicated bugs in the input machinery. We had a number of first time contributors and maybe hacktoberfest participants that made significant contributions and helped us free some time to focus on more complicated bugs.

### Unicode Completion update

In IPython 7.1 the Unicode completion map has been updated and synchronized with the Julia language.

Added and removed character characters:

> `\jmath` (`È·`), `\\underleftrightarrow` (U+034D, combining) have been added, while `\\textasciicaron` have been removed

Some sequences have seen their prefix removed:

>   - 6 characters `\text...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\...<tab>` directly,
>   - 45 characters `\Elz...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\...<tab>` directly,
>   - 65 characters `\B...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\...<tab>` directly,
>   - 450 characters `\m...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\...<tab>` directly,

Some sequences have seen their prefix shortened:

>   - 5 characters `\mitBbb...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\bbi...<tab>` directly,
>   - 52 characters `\mit...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\i...<tab>` directly,
>   - 216 characters `\mbfit...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\bi...<tab>` directly,
>   - 222 characters `\mbf...<tab>` should now be inputed with `\b...<tab>` directly,

A couple of characters had their sequence simplified:

>   - `Ã°`, type `\dh<tab>`, instead of `\eth<tab>`
>   - `Ä§`, type `\hbar<tab>`, instead of `\Elzxh<tab>`
>   - `É¸`, type `\ltphi<tab>`, instead of `\textphi<tab>`
>   - `Ï´`, type `\varTheta<tab>`, instead of `\textTheta<tab>`
>   - `â`, type `\eulermascheroni<tab>`, instead of `\Eulerconst<tab>`
>   - `â`, type `\planck<tab>`, instead of `\Planckconst<tab>`
>   - U+0336 (COMBINING LONG STROKE OVERLAY), type `\strike<tab>`, instead of `\Elzbar<tab>`.

A couple of sequences have been updated:

>   - `\varepsilon` now gives `É` (GREEK SMALL LETTER EPSILON) instead of `Îµ` (GREEK LUNATE EPSILON SYMBOL),
>   - `\underbar` now gives U+0331 (COMBINING MACRON BELOW) instead of U+0332 (COMBINING LOW LINE).

## IPython 7.0.0

Released Thursday September 27th, 2018

IPython 7 includes major feature improvements. This is also the second major version of IPython to support only Python 3 âÂ starting at Python 3.4. Python 2 is still community-supported on the bugfix only 5.x branch, but we remind you that Python 2 "end of life" is on Jan 1st 2020.

We were able to backport bug fixes to the 5.x branch thanks to our backport bot which backported more than [70 Pull-Requests](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?page=3&q=is%3Apr+sort%3Aupdated-desc+author%3Aapp%2Fmeeseeksdev++5.x&utf8=%E2%9C%93), but there are still many PRs that required manual work. This is an area of the project where you can easily contribute by looking for [PRs that still need manual backport](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?q=label%3A%22Still+Needs+Manual+Backport%22+is%3Aclosed+sort%3Aupdated-desc)

The IPython 6.x branch will likely not see any further release unless critical bugs are found.

Make sure you have pip \> 9.0 before upgrading. You should be able to update by running:

    pip install ipython --upgrade

<div class="only">

ipydev

If you are trying to install or update an `alpha`, `beta`, or `rc` version, use pip `--pre` flag.

    pip install ipython --upgrade --pre

</div>

Or, if you have conda installed:

    conda install ipython

### Prompt Toolkit 2.0

IPython 7.0+ now uses `prompt_toolkit 2.0`. If you still need to use an earlier `prompt_toolkit` version, you may need to pin IPython to `<7.0`.

### Autowait: Asynchronous REPL

Staring with IPython 7.0 on Python 3.6+, IPython can automatically `await` top level code. You should not need to access an event loop or runner yourself. To learn more, read the \[autoawait\](\#autoawait) section of our docs, see `11265`, or try the following code:

    Python 3.6.0
    Type 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information
    IPython 7.0.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.
    
    In [1]: import aiohttp
       ...: result = aiohttp.get('https://api.github.com')
    
    In [2]: response = await result
    <pause for a few 100s ms>
    
    In [3]: await response.json()
    Out[3]:
    {'authorizations_url': 'https://api.github.com/authorizations',
     'code_search_url': 'https://api.github.com/search/code?q={query}{&page,per_page,sort,order}',
    ...
    }

\> **Note** \> Async integration is experimental code, behavior may change or be removed between Python and IPython versions without warnings.

Integration is by default with <span class="title-ref">asyncio</span>, but other libraries can be configured --like `curio` or `trio` -- to improve concurrency in the REPL:

    In [1]: %autoawait trio
    
    In [2]: import trio
    
    In [3]: async def child(i):
       ...:     print("   child %s goes to sleep"%i)
       ...:     await trio.sleep(2)
       ...:     print("   child %s wakes up"%i)
    
    In [4]: print('parent start')
       ...: async with trio.open_nursery() as n:
       ...:     for i in range(3):
       ...:         n.spawn(child, i)
       ...: print('parent end')
    parent start
       child 2 goes to sleep
       child 0 goes to sleep
       child 1 goes to sleep
       <about 2 seconds pause>
       child 2 wakes up
       child 1 wakes up
       child 0 wakes up
    parent end

See \[autoawait\](\#autoawait) for more information.

Asynchronous code in a Notebook interface or any other frontend using the Jupyter Protocol will require further updates to the IPykernel package.

#### Non-Asynchronous code

As the internal API of IPython is now asynchronous, IPython needs to run under an event loop. In order to allow many workflows, (like using the `%run` magic, or copy-pasting code that explicitly starts/stop event loop), when top-level code is detected as not being asynchronous, IPython code is advanced via a pseudo-synchronous runner, and may not advance pending tasks.

#### Change to Nested Embed

The introduction of the ability to run async code had some effect on the `IPython.embed()` API. By default, embed will not allow you to run asynchronous code unless an event loop is specified.

#### Effects on Magics

Some magics will not work with async until they're updated. Contributions welcome.

#### Expected Future changes

We expect more internal but public IPython functions to become `async`, and will likely end up having a persistent event loop while IPython is running.

#### Thanks

This release took more than a year in the making. The code was rebased a number of times; leading to commit authorship that may have been lost in the final Pull-Request. Huge thanks to many people for contribution, discussion, code, documentation, use-cases: dalejung, danielballan, ellisonbg, fperez, gnestor, minrk, njsmith, pganssle, tacaswell, takluyver , vidartf ... And many others.

### Autoreload Improvement

The magic `%autoreload 2 <autoreload>` now captures new methods added to classes. Earlier, only methods existing as of the initial import were being tracked and updated.

This new feature helps dual environment development - Jupyter+IDE - where the code gradually moves from notebook cells to package files as it gets structured.

**Example**: An instance of the class `MyClass` will be able to access the method `cube()` after it is uncommented and the file `file1.py` is saved on disk.

    # notebook
    
    from mymodule import MyClass
    first = MyClass(5)

    # mymodule/file1.py
    
    class MyClass:
    
        def __init__(self, a=10):
            self.a = a
    
        def square(self):
            print('compute square')
            return self.a*self.a
    
        # def cube(self):
        #     print('compute cube')
        #     return self.a*self.a*self.a

### Misc

The autoindent feature that was deprecated in 5.x was re-enabled and un-deprecated in `11257`

Make `%run -n -i ... <run>` work correctly. Earlier, if `%run` was passed both arguments, `-n` would be silently ignored. See `10308`

The `%%script` (as well as `%%bash`, `%%ruby`... ) cell magics now raise by default if the return code of the given code is non-zero (thus halting execution of further cells in a notebook). The behavior can be disable by passing the `--no-raise-error` flag.

### Deprecations

A couple of unused functions and methods have been deprecated and will be removed in future versions:

>   - `IPython.utils.io.raw_print_err`
>   - `IPython.utils.io.raw_print`

### Backwards incompatible changes

  - The API for transforming input before it is parsed as Python code has been completely redesigned: any custom input transformations will need to be rewritten. See \[/config/inputtransforms\](/config/inputtransforms.md) for details of the new API.

# 8.x Series

## IPython 8.29

Medium release for this end of october;

>   - Misc Python 3.13 compatibility `14536`, `14559`
>   - Add a `uv` line magic `14537`
>   - Add support for WEBP to `IPython.display.Image`. `14526`
>   - And many more bugfixes and quality of life improvements.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.29](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/136?closed=1) milestone.

### Preparing for 9.0

IPython 3.13 was released earlier this month, and this means that according to [Spec-0](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/), support for 3.10 will end soon.

There have been many minor version of IPython 8.x, so it is likely that one of the next version will simply bump to 9.0 and remove a lot of code mark as deprecated, and documentation/examples not relevant for terminal IPython.

The frequency of release and my time reviewing will also likely decrease more than it has already.

### For something completely different

[Rosalind Franklin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin) made some of the biggest contribution to the discovery of the helix structure of DNA. Unfortunately her work was [not recognized](https://www.nature.com/scitable/topicpage/rosalind-franklin-a-crucial-contribution-6538012/)

### Thanks

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.28

Slight delay of this September release as I was busy at Pydata Paris last week. Not many user visible changes for this release, a couple of bug fixes and workaround:

>   - `14480` AssertionError: assert \_xterm\_term\_title\_saved in WSL â It is unclear why the terminal title is not saved in WSL, if you've WSL experience we'd love your feedback and help to not just ignore an error
>   - `14510` Fix use of pyside6 \>= 6.7.0
>   - `14518` Make values public (\_tb\_highlight & \_tb\_highlight\_style)
>   - `14515` Use environment variable to identify conda / mamba

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.28](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/135?closed=1) milestone.

### For something completely different

One of the first works of Science Fiction ([Frankenstein](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein)), was written by [Mary Shelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mary_Shelley) when she was 18, before being published in London on 1 January 1818 when she was 20. This is often overlooked, and the role of founders of science fiction attribute to Edgar Allan Poe and Jules Verne despite being published later.

### Thanks

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.27

New release of IPython after a month off (not enough changes). We can see a few important changes for this release.

>   - autocall was being call getitem, `14486`
>   - Only copy files in startup dir if we just created it. `14497`
>   - Fix some tests on Python 3.13 RC1 `14504`; this one I guess make this the first IPython release officially compatible with Python 3.13; you will need the most recent `executing` and `stack_data`, we won't pin to avoid forcing user of older Python version to upgrade.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.27](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/134?closed=1) milestone.

### Thanks

Many thanks to [@Kleirre](https://github.com/Kleirre) our June intern for doing her first contribution to open source, doing the releases notes and release. I guess you didn't even notice it was not me who released :-). I wish her all the best in her future endeavor and look forward for her work in astrophysics.

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

## IPython 8.26

Hey, the release of IPython for this month is here\! (I know you were waiting for it)

  - `14453` bugfix for call to structured\_traceback
  - `14466` fixed honoring custom repr for NamedTuple if assigned by partialmethod
  - `14451` Convert matplotlib gui name in enable\_gui

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.26](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/133?closed=1) milestone.

### Thanks

## IPython 8.25

Mostly internal changes for this end of may release of IPython.

We'll count about a dozen PRs for this moth, with small bugfixes related to matplotlib fixes.

Of notable interest,

>   - `14426` replaces the unicode micro symbol with greek letter mu, visually identical but should fix nfkc normalisations issues.
>   - `14444` introduces `intersphinx_registry` as a new dependency which is recommended only to build documentation.

## IPython 8.24

Back on regular release schedule, as usual month releases are relatively tiny.

The biggest change is the move of the matplotlib backend handling from IPython to matplotlib. `14371` `14403`.

We will note:

>   - pytest 8 compatibility `14413`
>   - `typing-extension` now needs 4.6 or newer. It was already the case, but not explicated. `14380`
>   - Attempt to speed running code under debugger in some cases. `14386` `14418`.
>   - Multiple fixes to documentation for ipyparallel, simple\_prompt and emacs `14384` `14404` `14407`
>   - Maintenance and cleanup of debugger `14387` `14393`

## IPython 8.23

Super tiny release of IPython on Sunday âÂ a bit later than usual, which is also [ð³ï¸ââ§ï¸ International Transgender Day of Visibilityð³ï¸ââ§ï¸](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Transgender_Day_of_Visibility) â so a though for you on this day, you matter and you are valid\[1\].

This is a minuscule release with only 5 Pull requests.

Main change is `14357` which improve inference from return type annotations in completer and the introduction of the optional target `ipython[matplotlib]` to explicitly request the matplotlib optional dependencies.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.23](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/130?closed=1) milestone.

## IPython 8.22, 8.22.1 and 8.22.2

Quick release of IPython for this short month of February, with quite a bit of activity with more than 15 PRs.

I am not going to details all the changes, but among other we have :

>   - More compatibility with emscripten `14316`, `14318`,
>   - Test more downstream project to avoid breakage `14317`
>   - Fix recently introduced bug with the `store` magic.
>   - Fix issues with multiple call to `matplotlib.pyplot.switch_backend`
>   - Fix crashing IPython when some tracebacks encounter dynamically evaluated code.

IPython 8.22.1 increase the minimal traitlets version, and 8.22.2 fix a critical bug on emscripten preventing to use some magics like `%matplotlib` on jupyter-light.

### API changes

One of the largest change is the update the mimehooks and inspector API, see `14342`. It should be backward compatible, but many hooks now receive a single object with many fields allowing us flexibility to update the API later.

### Packaging changes

Thanks to [@mkoppe](https://github.com/mkoeppe), we are slowly getting rid of setup.py finally migrating to `pyproject.toml`. There is still quite a bit of work, and please open an issue if you encounter any problem.

### Deprecation

A number of unused functions have been marked deprecated or pending deprecation. Please let us know if you encounter any of those deprecation messages for us to adjust the removal timeline.

### Thanks

Many thanks to [@mkoppe](https://github.com/mkoeppe) and [@krassowski](https://github.com/krassowski) for their multiple contributions and codebase cleanup.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.22](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/129?closed=1) milestone.

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.21

More substantial release of IPython slightly out of schedule as it was not possible for me to make a release last Friday.

Few new features are present, but the codebase has been cleaned, and a couple of API are \_[considered]() for deprecation. They are not deprecated yet, but as they do not seem to be quite used, they may emit a warning, in which case please comment on the relevant issue to inform me of \_[which]() project use those feature and how you use them. Depending on the feedback I might change the timeline for deprecation.

This release saw 14 PRs, with more outside contribution than usual, I'll note in particular PRs related to making IPython work on emscripten.

I also want to point that we are \_[trying]() to keep compatibility with Python 3.13, but it's a cat and mouse game. Plus I am low on time, so I would appreciate any help with that.

#### Deprecations

>   - `14307` Pending Deprecation of `ColorSchemeTable.set_active_scheme(...)`'s `case_sensitive` Parameter.
>   - `14305` Pending Deprecation of constructing `ColorScheme` via `kwargs`, in favor passing a single dict.

#### Fixes

>   - `14284` TerminalIPythonApp's would warn that `auto_create` option is not recognized.
>   - `14286` Fix a crash with `NotOneValueFound` when rendering complex tracebacks.
>   - `14287` Partial Python 3.13 compatibility
>   - `14290` Docs/Typos.

#### Changes

>   - `14289` `ipdb.set_trace()` now accepts `header=` for better compatibility with `pdb.set_trace()`
>   - `14300` and `14301` Add hooking ability to produce mimebundle.

We'll outline `14300`, it is now possible to extend the `?/??` operator to return more mimetypes to render richer help in frontends that support it. In particular you could send a json representation of the help that could be displayed in a customizable way.

#### Miscellaneous

>   - `14291` Misc Refactor of Color handling
>   - `14295` Misc test skip on problematic Pypy versions.

#### Thanks

Special thanks to all our contributors, and to the Pypy team that was extremely reactive in helping to investigate a fixing a rare unicode+windows bug.

### IPython 8.20

Quick IPython release in this beginning of 2024, barely 2 weeks after the previous release.

This is mostly to fix a backward compatibility issue, I would have done a patch release earlier if I could. As a few other cleanup are also part of this release, this will get a minor version bump.

The crux of this release is `14274` (Inspect continuation prompt signature and pass only viable arguments), the rest of the changes are mostly type annotation, and a few compatibility issues with Python 3.13 that are getting addressed.

Python 3.13 compatibility is still not complete (help welcomed).

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.20](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/127?closed=1) milestone.

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.19

New release of IPython a bit before the end of the month, and end of the year.

Mostly cleanup and deprecation, due to upstream deprecation and removal.

#### Remove of Python 3.9 support

A bit later than originally plan, IPython 8.19 does not support Python 3.9 anymore, as well as the few conditional code that were executing only on Python 3.9. `14254`

We used the opportunity to deprecate `IPython.utils.tz` `14256`, due to upstream deprecation of some timezone utilities. It will be removed at a later date.

We now also run CI on Python 3.12 (what I likely should have done before), but running on too many Python version uses a lot of CI time.

#### Absolute and relative Line Numbers in Prompts

Thanks to the contribution of `cohml`, IPython CLI now support absolute and relative line numbers in both vi and emacs prompt, use for example `c.TerminalInteractiveShell.prompt_line_number_format='{line: 4d}/{rel_line:+03d} | '` configuration option to display both in a custom format.

#### Miscellaneous

In addition to various bugfixes, I unpinned pytest, let me know if there are any issues and we'll re-pin.

#### See you in 2024

### IPython 8.18 and 8.18.1

8.18.1 is identical to 8.18 but pin `prompt_toolkit` to greater than `3.0.41`

Small release of IPython that fixes a small number of inconveniences.

>   - `14251` Fix a memory leak in qt event loop integration by setting the Loop parent to None.
>   - `14252` Pickleshare was made an optional dependency in 8.17, this leads to warnings in some installations when using modules completions. The warning has been silenced.
>   - `14241` Update event loop code for compatibility with more recent `prompt_toolkit` due to deprecations in Python 3.12.
>   - `14245` Fix doc example on Pygments styles
>   - `14238` Remove dependency on app\_nope, this is actually only a dependency of IPykernel.

### IPython 8.17, 8.17.1<span id="version 8.17.1"></span>

Medium-sized release of IPython that includes some cleanup (backcall, python2 leftovers) and some refactoring improvements (typing, pathlib) and a fix on completion.

>   - `14216` remove backcall dependency
>   - `14217` make pickleshare dependency optional
>   - `14185` support completion based on type annotations of calls

Reverted in 8.17.1:

>   - `14190` remove support for python 2 in lexers (reverted in 8.17.1 as it is imported by qtconsole/spyder)

#### Mamba and Micromamba magic commands

In addition to the `%conda` magic command for calling `conda` in IPython, the `%mamba` and `%micromamba` magic commands now call `mamba` and `micromamba` if they are on `sys.path`.

    %mamba install pkgname
    %micromamba install pkgname
    %conda install pkgname
    %pip install pkgname
    
    %mamba --help
    %micromamba --help
    %conda --help
    %pip --help    # works w/ JupyterLite
    !pip --help

### IPython 8.16, 8.16.1<span id="version 8.16"></span>

Small double release of IPython (with the 8.12.3 release notes just below). Mostly bug fixes and cleanups, and type annotations. Of interest for users:

>   - `14153` Fix a bug of the new iPdb chained traceback where some Exception would not have any traceback. (see upstream fix in CPython for more details).
>   - `14168` Fix case with spurious message about event loops when using matplotlib.

### IPython 8.12.3

Tiny release of 8.12.3 that backport a small number of fixes for users still using Python 3.8.

>   - `14080` add passthrough filter shortcuts
>   - `14169` Fix <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShellEmbed</span>

### IPython 8.15

Medium release of IPython after a couple of month hiatus, and a bit off-schedule.

Among other, IPython 8.15:

>   - Improve compatibility with future version of Python 3.12/3.13 `14107`, `14139`,
>   - Improve support for `ExceptionGroups`, `14108`
>   - Fix hangs in `%gui osx`, `14125`
>   - Fix memory lead with `%reset`, `14133`
>   - Unstable config option to modify traceback highlighting that is sometime hard to read `14138`
>   - Support `.` in `ipdb` as an argument to the `list` command `14121`
>   - Workroud `parso` showing warning message when the default logger level is changed `14119`
>   - Fix multiple issues with matplotlib interactive mode, qt5/qt6 `14128`

#### Support for PEP-678 Exception Notes

Ultratb now shows `678` notes, improving your debugging experience on Python 3.11+ or with libraries such as Pytest and Hypothesis.

#### Native fallback for displaying ExceptionGroup

ExceptionGroups are now displayed with `traceback.print_exc`, as a temporary fix until UltraTB properly supports displaying child exceptions.

We have two larger features:

#### AST-based macros

`14100` introduce a new and efficient way to modify each execution block (cell) using an template-ast-based transform. Unlike IPython pre and post code execution hooks, this actually transform the code that is execute with as minimal as possible overhead. While it was already technically possible to register ast transformers for IPython this was far from evident.

This should make it trivial to hook into IPython to implement custom hooks, that for example time or profile your code, catch exceptions to provide error messages for students or do any other kind of transformations.

In addition to programmatic API there is also a magic to quickly register hooks:

    In [1]: %%code_wrap before_after
       ...: print('before')
       ...: __code__
       ...: print('after')
       ...: __ret__

This mean that for any subsequent execution code will be executed. You can modify the above to print the date, compute the execution time, retry the code in a for loop....

#### Allow IPdb/Pdb to move between chained exceptions

The main change is the addition of the ability to move between chained exceptions when using IPdb, this feature was also contributed to upstream Pdb and is thus native to CPython in Python 3.13+ Though ipdb should support this feature in older version of Python. I invite you to look at the [CPython changes and docs](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/106676) for more details.

In short, once in post-mortem debugger (`%debug`), you can use the ipdb `exceptions` command to switch exceptions, for example:

`` `ipython     In [1]: def foo(x):         ...:     try:         ...:         bar(x)         ...:     except Exception as e:         ...:         raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e         ...:         ...: def bar(x):         ...:     1 / X         ...:      In [2]: foo(0)     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------     NameError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)     Cell In[1], line 3, in foo(x)           2 try:     ----> 3     bar(x)           4 except Exception as e:      Cell In[1], line 9, in bar(x)           8 def bar(x):     ----> 9     1 / X      NameError: name 'X' is not defined      The above exception was the direct cause of the following exception:      ValueError                                Traceback (most recent call last)     Cell In[2], line 1     ----> 1 foo(0)      Cell In[1], line 5, in foo(x)           3     bar(x)           4 except Exception as e:     ----> 5     raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e      ValueError: foo (): bar failed      In [3]: %debug     > <ipython-input-1-b0bbdc271ffb>(5)foo()           3         bar(x)           4     except Exception as e:     ----> 5         raise ValueError("foo (): bar failed") from e  In previous ipdb you could not go into the bar error, now from within pdb you ``<span class="title-ref"> can use </span><span class="title-ref">exceptions</span>\`:

`` `ipython     ipdb> exceptions         0 NameError("name 'X' is not defined")     >   1 ValueError('foo (): bar failed')      ipdb> exceptions 0     > <ipython-input-1-b0bbdc271ffb>(9)bar()           6           7           8 def bar(x):     ----> 9     1 / X          10      ipdb>  In particular I want to thank the `D.E.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.15 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/120?closed=1).

### IPython 8.14

Small release of IPython.

>   - `14080` fixes some shortcuts issues.
>   - `14056` Add option to `%autoreload` to hide errors when reloading code. This will be the default for spyder user is my understanding.
>   - `14039` (and `14040`) to show exception notes in tracebacks.
>   - `14076` Add option to EventManager to prevent printing

#### SPEC 0 and SPEC 4

You've heard about the NEPs, (NumPy enhancement Proposal), having a NEP for something non-numpy specific was sometime confusing. Long live the [SPECs](https://scientific-python.org/specs/).

We are now trying to follow SPEC 0 (aka old NEP 29) for support of upstream libraries.

We also now try to follow SPEC 4 (test and publish nightly on a centralized nightly repository). We encourage you to do so as well in order to report breakage, and contribute to the SPEC process \!

#### Python 3.12 compatibility ?

Python 3.12 changed its tokenizer to have better support for f-strings and allow arbitrary expression. This is a great new feature and performance improvement in Python 3.12.

Unfortunately this means the new tokenizer does not support incomplete or invalid Python which will break many features of IPython. Thus compatibility of IPython with Python 3.12 is not guaranteed. It is unclear to which extent IPython is affected, and whether we can/should try to still support magics, shell escape (`! ....`), ..., as well as how to do it if we can.

In addition even if we there is technical feasibility to do so, it is no clear we have the resources to do it. We are thus looking for your help if you can \_[test]() on Python 3.12 to see to which extent this affects users and which features are critical.

We are not going to pin IPython to Python `<3.12` as otherwise on install pip would downgrade/resolve to IPython 8.13, so if you plan to update to Python 3.12 after its release, we encourage for extra care.

### IPython 8.13.1, 8.13.2 and 8.12.2<span id="version 8.13.2"></span><span id="version 8.13.1"></span>

3 quick in succession patch release of IPython in addition to IPython 8.13.0 having been yanked.

IPython 8.13.0 was improperly tagged as still compatible with Python 3.8, and still had some mention of compatibility with 3.8. IPython 8.13.1 is identical to 8.13 but with the exception of being correctly tagged. This release and yank was mostly done to fix CI.

IPython 8.12.2 and 8.13.2 contain UI fixes, with respect to right arrow not working in some case in the terminal, and 8.12.2 contain also a requested backport of `14029` (Allow safe access to the `__getattribute__` method of modules) for tab completion.

### IPython 8.13

As usual for the end of the month, minor release of IPython. This release is significant in that it not only has a number of bugfixes, but also drop support for Python 3.8 as per NEP 29 (`14023`).

All the critical bugfixes have been backported onto the 8.12.1 release (see below). In addition to that went into 8.12.1 you'll find:

>   - Pretty representation for `Counter` has been fixed to match the Python one and be in decreasing order. `14032`
>   - Module completion is better when jedi is disabled `14029`.
>   - Improvement of `%%bash` magic that would get stuck `14019`

We hope you enjoy this release an will maybe see you at JupyterCon in less than two weeks.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.13 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/115?closed=1).

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.12.1

This is the twin release of IPython 8.13 that contain only critical UI and bug fixes. The next minor version of IPython has dropped support for Python 3.8 â as per Nep 29 and this IPython 8.12.x will now only receive bugfixes.

>   - `14004` Fix a bug introduced in IPython 8.12 that crash when inspecting some docstrings.
>   - `14010` Fix fast traceback code that was not working in some case.
>   - `14014` Fix `%page` magic broken in some case.
>   - `14026`, `14027` Tweak default shortcut with respect to autosuggestions.
>   - `14033` add back the ability to use `.get()` on OInfo object for backward compatibility with h5py (this will be re-deprecated later, and h5py will also get a fix).

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.12

Hopefully slightly early release for IPython 8.12. Last Thursday of the month, even if I guess it's likely already Friday somewhere in the pacific ocean.

A number of PRs and bug fixes this month with close to 20 PRs merged \!

The IPython repo reached `14000` \!\! Actually the PR that create those exact release note is `14000`. Ok, more issues and PR is not always better, and I'd love to have more time to close issues and Pull Requests.

Let's note that in less than 2 month JupyterCon is back, in Paris please visit [jupytercon.com](https://jupytercon.com), and looking forward to see you there.

Packagers should take note that `typing_extension` is now a mandatory dependency for Python versions `<3.10`.

Let's note also that according to [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), It is soon time to stop support for Python 3.8 that will be release more than 3 and 1/2 years ago:

    On Apr 14, 2023 drop support for Python 3.8 (initially released on Oct 14, 2019)

Thus I am likely to stop advertising support for Python 3.8 in the next release at the end of April.

Here are some miscellaneous updates of interest:

>   - `13957` brings updates to the Qt integration, particularly for Qt6.
>   - `13960` fixes the %debug magic command to give access to the local scope.
>   - `13964` fixes some crashes with the new fast traceback code. Note that there are still some issues with the fast traceback code, and I a, likely to fix and tweak behavior.
>   - `13973` We are slowly migrating IPython internals to use proper type objects/dataclasses instead of dictionaries to allow static typing checks. These are technically public API and could lead to breakage, so please let us know if that's the case and I'll mitigate.
>   - `13990`, `13991`, `13994` all improve keybinding and shortcut configurability.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.12 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/114?closed=1).

We want to thank the D.E. Shaw group for requesting and sponsoring the work on the following big feature. We had productive discussions on how to best expose this feature

#### Dynamic documentation dispatch

We are experimenting with dynamic documentation dispatch for object attribute. See `13860`. The goal is to allow object to define documentation for their attributes, properties, even when those are dynamically defined with <span class="title-ref">\_\_getattr\_\_</span>.

In particular when those objects are base types it can be useful to show the documentation

`` `ipython     In [1]: class User:        ...:        ...:     __custom_documentations__ = {        ...:         "first": "The first name of the user.",        ...:         "last": "The last name of the user.",        ...:     }        ...:        ...:     first:str        ...:     last:str        ...:        ...:     def __init__(self, first, last):        ...:         self.first = first        ...:         self.last = last        ...:        ...:     @property        ...:     def full(self):        ...:         """`self.first` and `self.last` joined by a space."""        ...:         return self.first + " " + self.last        ...:        ...:        ...: user = Person('Jane', 'Doe')      In [2]: user.first?     Type:            str     String form:     Jane     Length:          4     Docstring:       the first name of a the person object, a str     Class docstring:     ....      In [3]: user.last?     Type:            str     String form:     Doe     Length:          3     Docstring:       the last name, also a str     ...   We can see here the symmetry with IPython looking for the docstring on the ``\` properties:

`` `ipython     In [4]: user.full?     HERE     Type:        property     String form: <property object at 0x102bb15d0>     Docstring:   first and last join by a space   Note that while in the above example we use a static dictionary, libraries may ``<span class="title-ref"> decide to use a custom object that define </span><span class="title-ref">\_\_getitem\_\_</span>\`, we caution against using objects that would trigger computation to show documentation, but it is sometime preferable for highly dynamic code that for example export ans API as object.

### IPython 8.11

Back on almost regular monthly schedule for IPython with end-of-month really-late-Friday release to make sure some bugs are properly fixed. Small addition of with a few new features, bugfix and UX improvements.

This is a non-exhaustive list, but among other you will find:

#### Faster Traceback Highlighting

Resurrection of pre-IPython-8 traceback highlighting code.

Really long and complicated files were slow to highlight in traceback with IPython 8 despite upstream improvement that make many case better. Therefore starting with IPython 8.11 when one of the highlighted file is more than 10 000 line long by default, we'll fallback to a faster path that does not have all the features of highlighting failing AST nodes.

This can be configures by setting the value of `IPython.code.ultratb.FAST_THRESHOLD` to an arbitrary low or large value.

#### Autoreload verbosity

We introduce more descriptive names for the `%autoreload` parameter:

  - `%autoreload now` (also `%autoreload`) - perform autoreload immediately.
  - `%autoreload off` (also `%autoreload 0`) - turn off autoreload.
  - `%autoreload explicit` (also `%autoreload 1`) - turn on autoreload only for modules whitelisted by `%aimport` statements.
  - `%autoreload all` (also `%autoreload 2`) - turn on autoreload for all modules except those blacklisted by `%aimport` statements.
  - `%autoreload complete` (also `%autoreload 3`) - all the features of `all` but also adding new objects from the imported modules (see IPython/extensions/tests/test\_autoreload.py::test\_autoload\_newly\_added\_objects).

The original designations (e.g. "2") still work, and these new ones are case-insensitive.

Additionally, the option `--print` or `-p` can be added to the line to print the names of modules being reloaded. Similarly, `--log` or `-l` will output the names to the logger at INFO level. Both can be used simultaneously.

The parsing logic for `%aimport` is now improved such that modules can be whitelisted and blacklisted in the same line, e.g. it's now possible to call `%aimport os, -math` to include `os` for `%autoreload explicit` and exclude `math` for modes `all` and `complete`.

#### Terminal shortcuts customization

Previously modifying shortcuts was only possible by hooking into startup files and practically limited to adding new shortcuts or removing all shortcuts bound to a specific key. This release enables users to override existing terminal shortcuts, disable them or add new keybindings.

For example, to set the `right` to accept a single character of auto-suggestion you could use:

    my_shortcuts = [
        {
            "command": "IPython:auto_suggest.accept_character",
            "new_keys": ["right"]
        }
    ]
    %config TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts = my_shortcuts

You can learn more in :std`TerminalInteractiveShell.shortcuts` configuration reference.

#### Miscellaneous

>   - `%gui` should now support PySide6. `13864`
>   - Cli shortcuts can now be configured `13928`, see above. (note that there might be an issue with prompt\_toolkit 3.0.37 and shortcut configuration).
>   - Capture output should now respect `;` semicolon to suppress output. `13940`
>   - Base64 encoded images (in jupyter frontend), will not have trailing newlines. `13941`

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.10

Out of schedule release of IPython with minor fixes to patch a potential CVE-2023-24816. This is a really low severity CVE that you most likely are not affected by unless:

>   - You are on windows.
>   - You have a custom build of Python without `_ctypes`
>   - You cd or start IPython or Jupyter in untrusted directory which names may be valid shell commands.

You can read more on [the advisory](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-29gw-9793-fvw7).

In addition to fixing this CVE we also fix a couple of outstanding bugs and issues.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.10 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/112?closed=1).

In Particular:

>   - bump minimum numpy to <span class="title-ref">\>=1.21</span> version following NEP29. `13930`
>   - fix for compatibility with MyPy 1.0. `13933`
>   - fix nbgrader stalling when IPython's `showtraceback` function is monkeypatched. `13934`

As this release also contains those minimal changes in addition to fixing the CVE I decided to bump the minor version anyway.

This will not affect the normal release schedule, so IPython 8.11 is due in about 2 weeks.

### IPython 8.9.0

Second release of IPython in 2023, last Friday of the month, we are back on track. This is a small release with a few bug-fixes, and improvements, mostly with respect to terminal shortcuts.

The biggest improvement for 8.9 is a drastic amelioration of the auto-suggestions sponsored by D.E. Shaw and implemented by the more and more active contributor <span class="title-ref">@krassowski \<https://github.com/krassowski\></span>.

  - `right` accepts a single character from suggestion
  - `ctrl+right` accepts a semantic token (macos default shortcuts take precedence and need to be disabled to make this work)
  - `backspace` deletes a character and resumes hinting autosuggestions
  - `ctrl-left` accepts suggestion and moves cursor left one character.
  - `backspace` deletes a character and resumes hinting autosuggestions
  - `down` moves to suggestion to later in history when no lines are present below the cursors.
  - `up` moves to suggestion from earlier in history when no lines are present above the cursor.

This is best described by the Gif posted by <span class="title-ref">@krassowski \<https://github.com/krassowski\></span>, and in the PR itself `13888`.

![image](../_images/autosuggest.gif)

Please report any feedback in order for us to improve the user experience. In particular we are also working on making the shortcuts configurable.

If you are interested in better terminal shortcuts, I also invite you to participate in issue [13879](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/13879).

As we follow [NEP29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html), next version of IPython will officially stop supporting numpy 1.20, and will stop supporting Python 3.8 after April release.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.9 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/111?closed=1).

### IPython 8.8.0

First release of IPython in 2023 as there was no release at the end of December.

This is an unusually big release (relatively speaking) with more than 15 Pull Requests merged.

Of particular interest are:

>   - `13852` that replaces the greedy completer and improves completion, in particular for dictionary keys.
>   - `13858` that adds `py.typed` to `setup.cfg` to make sure it is bundled in wheels.
>   - `13869` that implements tab completions for IPython options in the shell when using <span class="title-ref">argcomplete \<https://github.com/kislyuk/argcomplete\></span>. I believe this also needs a recent version of Traitlets.
>   - `13865` makes the `inspector` class of <span class="title-ref">InteractiveShell</span> configurable.
>   - `13880` that removes minor-version entrypoints as the minor version entry points that would be included in the wheel would be the one of the Python version that was used to build the `whl` file.

In no particular order, the rest of the changes update the test suite to be compatible with Pygments 2.14, various docfixes, testing on more recent python versions and various updates.

As usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.8 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/110).

Many thanks to @krassowski for the many PRs and @jasongrout for reviewing and merging contributions.

### IPython 8.7.0

Small release of IPython with a couple of bug fixes and new features for this month. Next month is the end of year, it is unclear if there will be a release close to the new year's eve, or if the next release will be at the end of January.

Here are a few of the relevant fixes, as usual you can find the full list of PRs on GitHub under [the 8.7 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=milestone%3A8.7).

>   - `13834` bump the minimum prompt toolkit to 3.0.11.
>   - IPython shipped with the `py.typed` marker now, and we are progressively adding more types. `13831`
>   - `13817` add configuration of code blacks formatting.

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.6.0

Back to a more regular release schedule (at least I try), as Friday is already over by more than 24h hours. This is a slightly bigger release with a few new features that contain no less than 25 PRs.

We'll notably found a couple of non negligible changes:

The `install_ext` and related functions have been removed after being deprecated for years. You can use pip to install extensions. `pip` did not exist when `install_ext` was introduced. You can still load local extensions without installing them. Just set your `sys.path` for example. `13744`

IPython now has extra entry points that use the major *and minor* version of python. For some of you this means that you can do a quick `ipython3.10` to launch IPython from the Python 3.10 interpreter, while still using Python 3.11 as your main Python. `13743`

The completer matcher API has been improved. See `13745`. This should improve the type inference and improve dict keys completions in many use case. Thanks `@krassowski` for all the work, and the D.E. Shaw group for sponsoring it.

The color of error nodes in tracebacks can now be customized. See `13756`. This is a private attribute until someone finds the time to properly add a configuration option. Note that with Python 3.11 that also shows the relevant nodes in traceback, it would be good to leverage this information (plus the "did you mean" info added on attribute errors). But that's likely work I won't have time to do before long, so contributions welcome.

As we follow NEP 29, we removed support for numpy 1.19 `13760`.

The `open()` function present in the user namespace by default will now refuse to open the file descriptors 0,1,2 (stdin, out, err), to avoid crashing IPython. This mostly occurs in teaching context when incorrect values get passed around.

The `?`, `??`, and corresponding `pinfo`, `pinfo2` magics can now find objects inside arrays. That is to say, the following now works:

    >>> def my_func(*arg, **kwargs):pass
    >>> container = [my_func]
    >>> container[0]?

If `container` define a custom `getitem`, this \_\_will\_\_ trigger the custom method. So don't put side effects in your `getitems`. Thanks to the D.E. Shaw group for the request and sponsoring the work.

### IPython 8.5.0

First release since a couple of month due to various reasons and timing preventing me for sticking to the usual monthly release the last Friday of each month. This is of non negligible size as it has more than two dozen PRs with various fixes an bug fixes.

Many thanks to everybody who contributed PRs for your patience in review and merges.

Here is a non-exhaustive list of changes that have been implemented for IPython 8.5.0. As usual you can find the full list of issues and PRs tagged with [the 8.5 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/pulls?q=is%3Aclosed+milestone%3A8.5+).

>   - Added a shortcut for accepting auto suggestion. The End key shortcut for accepting auto-suggestion This binding works in Vi mode too, provided `TerminalInteractiveShell.emacs_bindings_in_vi_insert_mode` is set to be `True` `13566`.
>   - No popup in window for latex generation when generating latex (e.g. via <span class="title-ref">\_latex\_repr\_</span>) no popup window is shows under Windows. `13679`
>   - Fixed error raised when attempting to tab-complete an input string with consecutive periods or forward slashes (such as "<file:///var/log/>..."). `13675`
>   - Relative filenames in Latex rendering : The <span class="title-ref">latex\_to\_png\_dvipng</span> command internally generates input and output file arguments to <span class="title-ref">latex</span> and <span class="title-ref">dvipis</span>. These arguments are now generated as relative files to the current working directory instead of absolute file paths. This solves a problem where the current working directory contains characters that are not handled properly by <span class="title-ref">latex</span> and <span class="title-ref">dvips</span>. There are no changes to the user API. `13680`
>   - Stripping decorators bug: Fixed bug which meant that ipython code blocks in restructured text documents executed with the ipython-sphinx extension skipped any lines of code containing python decorators. `13612`
>   - Allow some modules with frozen dataclasses to be reloaded. `13732`
>   - Fix paste magic on wayland. `13671`
>   - show maxlen in deque's repr. `13648`

#### Restore line numbers for Input

Line number information in tracebacks from input are restored. Line numbers from input were removed during the transition to v8 enhanced traceback reporting.

So, instead of:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    Input In [3], in <cell line: 1>()
    ----> 1 myfunc(2)
    
    Input In [2], in myfunc(z)
          1 def myfunc(z):
    ----> 2     foo.boo(z-1)
    
    File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3, in boo(x)
          2 def boo(x):
    ----> 3     return 1/(1-x)
    
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The error traceback now looks like:

    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    Cell In [3], line 1
    ----> 1 myfunc(2)
    
    Cell In [2], line 2, in myfunc(z)
          1 def myfunc(z):
    ----> 2     foo.boo(z-1)
    
    File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3, in boo(x)
          2 def boo(x):
    ----> 3     return 1/(1-x)
    
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

or, with xmode=Plain:

    Traceback (most recent call last):
      Cell In [12], line 1
        myfunc(2)
      Cell In [6], line 2 in myfunc
        foo.boo(z-1)
      File ~/code/python/ipython/foo.py:3 in boo
        return 1/(1-x)
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

`13560`

#### New setting to silence warning if working inside a virtual environment

Previously, when starting IPython in a virtual environment without IPython installed (so IPython from the global environment is used), the following warning was printed:

> Attempting to work in a virtualenv. If you encounter problems, please install IPython inside the virtualenv.

This warning can be permanently silenced by setting `c.InteractiveShell.warn_venv` to `False` (the default is `True`).

### IPython 8.4.0

As for 7.34, this version contains a single fix: fix uncaught BdbQuit exceptions on ipdb exit `13668`, and a single typo fix in documentation: `13682`

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.3.0

>   - `13625`, using `?`, `??`, `*?` will not call `set_next_input` as most frontend allow proper multiline editing and it was causing issues for many users of multi-cell frontends. This has been backported to 7.33
>   - `13600`, `pre_run_*`-hooks will now have a `cell_id` attribute on the info object when frontend provides it. This has been backported to 7.33
>   - `13624`, fixed `End` key being broken after accepting an auto-suggestion.
>   - `13657` fixed an issue where history from different sessions would be mixed.

### IPython 8.2.0

IPython 8.2 mostly bring bugfixes to IPython.

>   - Auto-suggestion can now be elected with the `end` key. `13566`
>   - Some traceback issues with `assert etb is not None` have been fixed. `13588`
>   - History is now pulled from the sqitel database and not from in-memory. In particular when using the `%paste` magic, the content of the pasted text will be part of the history and not the verbatim text `%paste` anymore. `13592`
>   - Fix `Ctrl-\\` exit cleanup `13603`
>   - Fixes to `ultratb` ipdb support when used outside of IPython. `13498`

I am still trying to fix and investigate `13598`, which seems to be random, and would appreciate help if you find a reproducible minimal case. I've tried to make various changes to the codebase to mitigate it, but a proper fix will be difficult without understanding the cause.

All the issues on pull-requests for this release can be found in the [8.2 milestone.](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/100) . And some documentation only PR can be found as part of the [7.33 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/101) (currently not released).

Thanks to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries.

### IPython 8.1.1

Fix an issue with virtualenv and Python 3.8 introduced in 8.1

Revert `13537` (fix an issue with symlinks in virtualenv) that raises an error in Python 3.8, and fixed in a different way in `13559`.

### IPython 8.1.0

IPython 8.1 is the first minor release after 8.0 and fixes a number of bugs and updates a few behaviors that were problematic with the 8.0 as with many new major release.

Note that beyond the changes listed here, IPython 8.1.0 also contains all the features listed in \[version 7.32\](\#version-7.32).

>   - Misc and multiple fixes around quotation auto-closing. It is now disabled by default. Run with `TerminalInteractiveShell.auto_match=True` to re-enabled
>   - Require pygments\>=2.4.0 `13459`, this was implicit in the code, but is now explicit in `setup.cfg`/`setup.py`
>   - Docs improvement of `core.magic_arguments` examples. `13433`
>   - Multi-line edit executes too early with await. `13424`
>   - `black` is back as an optional dependency, and autoformatting disabled by default until some fixes are implemented (black improperly reformat magics). `13471` Additionally the ability to use `yapf` as a code reformatter has been added `13528` . You can use `TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter="black"`, `TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter="yapf"` to re-enable auto formatting with black, or switch to yapf.
>   - Fix and issue where `display` was not defined.
>   - Auto suggestions are now configurable. Currently only `AutoSuggestFromHistory` (default) and `None`. new provider contribution welcomed. `13475`
>   - multiple packaging/testing improvement to simplify downstream packaging (xfail with reasons, try to not access network...).
>   - Update deprecation. `InteractiveShell.magic` internal method has been deprecated for many years but did not emit a warning until now.
>   - internal `appended_to_syspath` context manager has been deprecated.
>   - fix an issue with symlinks in virtualenv `13537` (Reverted in 8.1.1)
>   - Fix an issue with vim mode, where cursor would not be reset on exit `13472`
>   - ipython directive now remove only known pseudo-decorators `13532`
>   - `IPython/lib/security` which used to be used for jupyter notebook has been removed.
>   - Fix an issue where `async with` would execute on new lines. `13436`

We want to remind users that IPython is part of the Jupyter organisations, and thus governed by a Code of Conduct. Some of the behavior we have seen on GitHub is not acceptable. Abuse and non-respectful comments on discussion will not be tolerated.

Many thanks to all the contributors to this release, many of the above fixed issues and new features were done by first time contributors, showing there is still plenty of easy contribution possible in IPython . You can find all individual contributions to this milestone [on github](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/91).

Thanks as well to the [D. E. Shaw group](https://deshaw.com/) for sponsoring work on IPython and related libraries. In particular the Lazy autoloading of magics that you will find described in the 7.32 release notes.

### IPython 8.0.1 (CVE-2022-21699)

IPython 8.0.1, 7.31.1 and 5.11 are security releases that change some default values in order to prevent potential Execution with Unnecessary Privileges.

Almost all version of IPython looks for configuration and profiles in current working directory. Since IPython was developed before pip and environments existed it was used a convenient way to load code/packages in a project dependent way.

In 2022, it is not necessary anymore, and can lead to confusing behavior where for example cloning a repository and starting IPython or loading a notebook from any Jupyter-Compatible interface that has ipython set as a kernel can lead to code execution.

I did not find any standard way for packaged to advertise CVEs they fix, I'm thus trying to add a `__patched_cves__` attribute to the IPython module that list the CVEs that should have been fixed. This attribute is informational only as if a executable has a flaw, this value can always be changed by an attacker.

    In [1]: import IPython
    
    In [2]: IPython.__patched_cves__
    Out[2]: {'CVE-2022-21699'}
    
    In [3]: 'CVE-2022-21699' in IPython.__patched_cves__
    Out[3]: True

Thus starting with this version:

>   - The current working directory is not searched anymore for profiles or configurations files.
>   - Added a `__patched_cves__` attribute (set of strings) to IPython module that contain the list of fixed CVE. This is informational only.

Further details can be read on the [GitHub Advisory](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/security/advisories/GHSA-pq7m-3gw7-gq5x)

### IPython 8.0

IPython 8.0 is bringing a large number of new features and improvements to both the user of the terminal and of the kernel via Jupyter. The removal of compatibility with an older version of Python is also the opportunity to do a couple of performance improvements in particular with respect to startup time. The 8.x branch started diverging from its predecessor around IPython 7.12 (January 2020).

This release contains 250+ pull requests, in addition to many of the features and backports that have made it to the 7.x branch. Please see the [8.0 milestone](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/milestone/73?closed=1) for the full list of pull requests.

Please feel free to send pull requests to update those notes after release, I have likely forgotten a few things reviewing 250+ PRs.

### Dependencies changes/downstream packaging

Most of our building steps have been changed to be (mostly) declarative and follow PEP 517. We are trying to completely remove `setup.py` (`13238`) and are looking for help to do so.

>   - minimum supported `traitlets` version is now 5+
>   - we now require `stack_data`
>   - minimal Python is now 3.8
>   - `nose` is not a testing requirement anymore
>   - `pytest` replaces nose.
>   - `iptest`/`iptest3` cli entrypoints do not exist anymore.
>   - the minimum officially âsupported `numpy` version has been bumped, but this should not have much effect on packaging.

### Deprecation and removal

We removed almost all features, arguments, functions, and modules that were marked as deprecated between IPython 1.0 and 5.0. As a reminder, 5.0 was released in 2016, and 1.0 in 2013. Last release of the 5 branch was 5.10.0, in May 2020. The few remaining deprecated features we left have better deprecation warnings or have been turned into explicit errors for better error messages.

I will use this occasion to add the following requests to anyone emitting a deprecation warning:

>   - Please add at least `stacklevel=2` so that the warning is emitted into the caller context, and not the callee one.
>   - Please add **since which version** something is deprecated.

As a side note, it is much easier to conditionally compare version numbers rather than using `try/except` when functionality changes with a version.

I won't list all the removed features here, but modules like `IPython.kernel`, which was just a shim module around `ipykernel` for the past 8 years, have been removed, and so many other similar things that pre-date the name **Jupyter** itself.

We no longer need to add `IPython.extensions` to the PYTHONPATH because that is being handled by `load_extension`.

We are also removing `Cythonmagic`, `sympyprinting` and `rmagic` as they are now in other packages and no longer need to be inside IPython.

### Documentation

The majority of our docstrings have now been reformatted and automatically fixed by the experimental [VÃ©lin](https://pypi.org/project/velin/) project to conform to numpydoc.

### Type annotations

While IPython itself is highly dynamic and can't be completely typed, many of the functions now have type annotations, and part of the codebase is now checked by mypy.

### Featured changes

Here is a features list of changes in IPython 8.0. This is of course non-exhaustive. Please note as well that many features have been added in the 7.x branch as well (and hence why you want to read the 7.x what's new notes), in particular features contributed by QuantStack (with respect to debugger protocol and Xeus Python), as well as many debugger features that I was pleased to implement as part of my work at QuanSight and sponsored by DE Shaw.

#### Traceback improvements

Previously, error tracebacks for errors happening in code cells were showing a hash, the one used for compiling the Python AST:

    In [1]: def foo():
    ...:     return 3 / 0
    ...:
    
    In [2]: foo()
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    <ipython-input-2-c19b6d9633cf> in <module>
    ----> 1 foo()
    
    <ipython-input-1-1595a74c32d5> in foo()
        1 def foo():
    ----> 2     return 3 / 0
        3
    
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The error traceback is now correctly formatted, showing the cell number in which the error happened:

    In [1]: def foo():
    ...:     return 3 / 0
    ...:
    
    Input In [2]: foo()
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
    ZeroDivisionError                         Traceback (most recent call last)
    input In [2], in <module>
    ----> 1 foo()
    
    Input In [1], in foo()
        1 def foo():
    ----> 2     return 3 / 0
    
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

The `stack_data` package has been integrated, which provides smarter information in the traceback; in particular it will highlight the AST node where an error occurs which can help to quickly narrow down errors.

For example in the following snippet:

    def foo(i):
        x = [[[0]]]
        return x[0][i][0]

    def bar():
        return foo(0) + foo(
            1
        ) + foo(2)

calling `bar()` would raise an `IndexError` on the return line of `foo`, and IPython 8.0 is capable of telling you where the index error occurs:

    IndexError
    Input In [2], in <module>
    ----> 1 bar()
            ^^^^^
    
    Input In [1], in bar()
          6 def bar():
    ----> 7     return foo(0) + foo(
                                ^^^^
          8         1
             ^^^^^^^^
          9     ) + foo(2)
             ^^^^
    
    Input In [1], in foo(i)
          1 def foo(i):
          2     x = [[[0]]]
    ----> 3     return x[0][i][0]
                       ^^^^^^^

The corresponding locations marked here with `^` will show up highlighted in the terminal and notebooks.

Finally, a colon `::` and line number is appended after a filename in traceback:

    ZeroDivisionError               Traceback (most recent call last)
    File ~/error.py:4, in <module>
          1 def f():
          2     1/0
    ----> 4 f()
    
    File ~/error.py:2, in f()
          1 def f():
    ----> 2     1/0

Many terminals and editors have integrations enabling you to directly jump to the relevant file/line when this syntax is used, so this small addition may have a high impact on productivity.

#### Autosuggestions

Autosuggestion is a very useful feature available in [fish](https://fishshell.com/), [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell), and [prompt-toolkit](https://python-prompt-toolkit.readthedocs.io/en/master/pages/asking_for_input.html#auto-suggestion).

[Ptpython](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython#ptpython) allows users to enable this feature in [ptpython/config.py](https://github.com/prompt-toolkit/ptpython/blob/master/examples/ptpython_config/config.py#L90).

This feature allows users to accept autosuggestions with ctrl e, ctrl f, or right arrow as described below.

1.  Start ipython

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_1_prompt_no_text.png)

2.  Run `print("hello")`

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_2_print_hello_suggest.png)

3.  start typing `print` again to see the autosuggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_3_print_hello_suggest.png)

4.  Press `ctrl-f`, or `ctrl-e`, or `right-arrow` to accept the suggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_4_print_hello.png)

You can also complete word by word:

1.  Run `def say_hello(): print("hello")`

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_second_prompt.png)

2.  Start typing the first letter if `def` to see the autosuggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png)

3.  Press `alt-f` (or `escape` followed by `f`), to accept the first word of the suggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png)

Importantly, this feature does not interfere with tab completion:

1.  After running `def say_hello(): print("hello")`, press d

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_d_phantom.png)

2.  Press Tab to start tab completion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_d_completions.png)

3A. Press Tab again to select the first option

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_def_completions.png)

3B. Press `alt f` (`escape`, `f`) to accept to accept the first word of the suggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_def_phantom.png)

3C. Press `ctrl-f` or `ctrl-e` to accept the entire suggestion

![image](../_images/8.0/auto_suggest_match_parens.png)

Currently, autosuggestions are only shown in the emacs or vi insert editing modes:

  - The ctrl e, ctrl f, and alt f shortcuts work by default in emacs mode.
  - To use these shortcuts in vi insert mode, you will have to create [custom keybindings in your config.py](https://github.com/mskar/setup/commit/2892fcee46f9f80ef7788f0749edc99daccc52f4/).

#### Show pinfo information in ipdb using "?" and "??"

In IPDB, it is now possible to show the information about an object using "?" and "??", in much the same way that it can be done when using the IPython prompt:

    ipdb> partial?
    Init signature: partial(self, /, *args, **kwargs)
    Docstring:
    partial(func, *args, **keywords) - new function with partial application
    of the given arguments and keywords.
    File:           ~/.pyenv/versions/3.8.6/lib/python3.8/functools.py
    Type:           type
    Subclasses:

Previously, `pinfo` or `pinfo2` command had to be used for this purpose.

#### Autoreload 3 feature

Example: When an IPython session is run with the 'autoreload' extension loaded, you will now have the option '3' to select, which means the following:

> 1.  replicate all functionality from option 2
> 2.  autoload all new funcs/classes/enums/globals from the module when they are added
> 3.  autoload all newly imported funcs/classes/enums/globals from external modules

Try `%autoreload 3` in an IPython session after running `%load_ext autoreload`.

For more information please see the following unit test : `extensions/tests/test_autoreload.py:test_autoload_newly_added_objects`

#### Auto formatting with black in the CLI

This feature was present in 7.x, but disabled by default.

In 8.0, input was automatically reformatted with Black when black was installed. This feature has been reverted for the time being. You can re-enable it by setting `TerminalInteractiveShell.autoformatter` to `"black"`

#### History Range Glob feature

Previously, when using `%history`, users could specify either a range of sessions and lines, for example:

`` `python    ~8/1-~6/5   # see history from the first line of 8 sessions ago,                # to the fifth line of 6 sessions ago. ``

Or users could specify a glob pattern:

``` python
-g <pattern>  # glob ALL history for the specified pattern.
```

However users could *not* specify both.

If a user *did* specify both a range and a glob pattern, `` ` then the glob pattern would be used (globbing *all* history) *and the range would be ignored*.  With this enhancement, if a user specifies both a range and a glob pattern, then the glob pattern will be applied to the specified range of history.  Don't start a multi-line cell with sunken parenthesis ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  From now on, IPython will not ask for the next line of input when given a single line with more closing than opening brackets. For example, this means that if you (mis)type ``\]\]`instead of`\[\]`, a`SyntaxError`will show up, instead of the`...:`prompt continuation.  IPython shell for ipdb interact ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  The ipdb`interact`starts an IPython shell instead of Python's built-in`code.interact()`.  Automatic Vi prompt stripping ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  When pasting code into IPython, it will strip the leading prompt characters if there are any. For example, you can paste the following code into the console - it will still work, even though each line is prefixed with prompts (`In`,`Out`)::      In [1]: 2 * 2 == 4     Out[1]: True      In [2]: print("This still works as pasted")   Previously, this was not the case for the Vi-mode prompts::      In [1]: [ins] In [13]: 2 * 2 == 4        ...: Out[13]: True        ...:       File "<ipython-input-1-727bb88eaf33>", line 1         [ins] In [13]: 2 * 2 == 4               ^     SyntaxError: invalid syntax  This is now fixed, and Vi prompt prefixes -`\[ins\]`and`\[nav\]`-  are skipped just as the normal`In`would be.  IPython shell can be started in the Vi mode using`ipython --TerminalInteractiveShell.editing\_mode=vi`, You should be able to change mode dynamically with`%config TerminalInteractiveShell.editing\_mode='vi'`Empty History Ranges ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  A number of magics that take history ranges can now be used with an empty range. These magics are:   *`%save`*`%load`*`%pastebin`*`%pycat`Using them this way will make them take the history of the current session up to the point of the magic call (such that the magic itself will not be included).  Therefore it is now possible to save the whole history to a file using`%save \<filename\>`, load and edit it using`%load``(makes for a nice usage when followed with :kbd:`F2`), send it to `dpaste.org <http://dpast.org>`_ using``%pastebin`, or view the whole thing syntax-highlighted with a single`%pycat`.   Windows timing implementation: Switch to process_time ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Timing on Windows, for example with`%%time`,  was changed from being based on`time.perf\_counter`(which counted time even when the process was sleeping) to being based on`time.process\_time``instead (which only counts CPU time). This brings it closer to the behavior on Linux. See :ghpull:`12984`.  Miscellaneous ~~~~~~~~~~~~~  - Non-text formatters are not disabled in the terminal, which should simplify    writing extensions displaying images or other mimetypes in supporting terminals.    :ghpull:`12315`  - It is now possible to automatically insert matching brackets in Terminal IPython using the``TerminalInteractiveShell.auto\_match=True``option. :ghpull:`12586`  - We are thinking of deprecating the current``%%javascript``magic in favor of a better replacement. See :ghpull:`13376`.  -``\~``is now expanded when part of a path in most magics :ghpull:`13385`  -``%/%%timeit``magic now adds a comma every thousands to make reading a long number easier :ghpull:`13379`  -``"info"``messages can now be customised to hide some fields :ghpull:`13343`  -``collections.UserList``now pretty-prints :ghpull:`13320`  - The debugger now has a persistent history, which should make it less    annoying to retype commands :ghpull:`13246`  -``\!pip`  `\!conda`  `\!cd`or`\!ls``are likely doing the wrong thing. We    now warn users if they use one of those commands. :ghpull:`12954`  - Make``%precision`work for`numpy.float64``type :ghpull:`12902`  Re-added support for XDG config directories ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  XDG support through the years comes and goes. There is a tension between having an identical location for configuration in all platforms versus having simple instructions. After initial failures a couple of years ago, IPython was modified to automatically migrate XDG config files back into``\~/.ipython`. That migration code has now been removed. IPython now checks the XDG locations, so if you _manually_ move your config files to your preferred location, IPython will not move them back.   Preparing for Python 3.10 -------------------------  To prepare for Python 3.10, we have started working on removing reliance and any dependency that is not compatible with Python 3.10. This includes migrating our test suite to pytest and starting to remove nose. This also means that the`iptest``command is now gone and all testing is via pytest.  This was in large part thanks to the NumFOCUS Small Developer grant, which enabled us to allocate \$4000 to hire `Nikita Kniazev (@Kojoley) <https://github.com/Kojoley>`_, who did a fantastic job at updating our code base, migrating to pytest, pushing our coverage, and fixing a large number of bugs. I highly recommend contacting them if you need help with C++ and Python projects.  You can find all relevant issues and PRs with `the SDG 2021 tag <https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues?q=label%3A%22Numfocus+SDG+2021%22+>`__  Removing support for older Python versions ------------------------------------------   We are removing support for Python up through 3.7, allowing internal code to use the more efficient``pathlib\`\` and to make better use of type annotations.

!["Meme image of Toy Story with Woody and Buzz, with the text 'pathlib, pathlib everywhere'"](../_images/8.0/pathlib_pathlib_everywhere.jpg)

We had about 34 PRs only to update some logic to update some functions from managing strings to using Pathlib.

The completer has also seen significant updates and now makes use of newer Jedi APIs, offering faster and more reliable tab completion.

## Triaging Issues

On the IPython repository,  we strive to trust users and give them responsibility.
By using one of our bots, any user can close issues or add/remove
labels by mentioning the bot and asking it to do things on your behalf.

To close an issue (or PR), even if you did not create it, use the following:

> @meeseeksdev close

This command can be in the middle of another comment, but must start on its
own line. 

To add labels to an issue, ask the bot to `tag` with a comma-separated list of
tags to add:

> @meeseeksdev tag windows, documentation

Only already pre-created tags can be added.  So far, the list is limited to:
`async/await`, `backported`, `help wanted`, `documentation`, `notebook`,
`tab-completion`, `windows`

To remove a label, use the `untag` command:

> @meeseeksdev untag windows, documentation

We'll be adding additional capabilities for the bot and will share them here
when they are ready to be used.

## Opening an Issue

When opening a new Issue, please take the following steps:

1. Search GitHub and/or Google for your issue to avoid duplicate reports.
   Keyword searches for your error messages are most helpful.
2. If possible, try updating to main and reproducing your issue,
   because we may have already fixed it.
3. Try to include a minimal reproducible test case.
4. Include relevant system information.  Start with the output of:

        python -c "import IPython; print(IPython.sys_info())"

   And include any relevant package versions, depending on the issue, such as
   matplotlib, numpy, Qt, Qt bindings (PyQt/PySide), tornado, web browser, etc.

## Pull Requests

Some guidelines on contributing to IPython:

* All work is submitted via Pull Requests.
* Pull Requests can be submitted as soon as there is code worth discussing.
  Pull Requests track the branch, so you can continue to work after the PR is submitted.
  Review and discussion can begin well before the work is complete,
  and the more discussion the better.
  The worst case is that the PR is closed.
* Pull Requests should generally be made against main
* Pull Requests should be tested, if feasible:
    - bugfixes should include regression tests.
    - new behavior should at least get minimal exercise.
* New features and backwards-incompatible changes should be documented by adding
  a new file to the [pr](docs/source/whatsnew/pr) directory, see [the README.md
  there](docs/source/whatsnew/pr/README.md) for details.
* Don't make 'cleanup' pull requests just to change code style.
  We don't follow any style guide strictly, and we consider formatting changes
  unnecessary noise.
  If you're making functional changes, you can clean up the specific pieces of
  code you're working on.

[GitHub Actions](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/actions/workflows/test.yml) does
a pretty good job testing IPython and Pull Requests,
but it may make sense to manually perform tests,
particularly for PRs that affect `IPython.parallel` or Windows.

For more detailed information, see our [GitHub Workflow](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/wiki/Dev:-GitHub-workflow).

## Running Tests

All the tests can be run by using
```shell
pytest
```

All the tests for a single module (for example **test_alias**) can be run by using the fully qualified path to the module.
```shell
pytest IPython/core/tests/test_alias.py
```

Only a single test (for example **test_alias_lifecycle**) within a single file can be run by adding the specific test after a `::` at the end:
```shell
pytest IPython/core/tests/test_alias.py::test_alias_lifecycle
```

## Code style

* Before committing, run `darker -r 60625f241f298b5039cb2debc365db38aa7bb522 <file path>` to apply selective `black` formatting on modified regions using [darker](https://github.com/akaihola/darker)==1.5.1 and black==22.10.0
* As described in the pull requests section, please avoid excessive formatting changes; if a formatting-only commit is necessary, consider adding its hash to [`.git-blame-ignore-revs`](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/blob/main/.git-blame-ignore-revs) file.

## Documentation

Sphinx documentation can be built locally using standard sphinx `make` commands. To build HTML documentation from the root of the project, execute:

```shell
pip install -r docs/requirements.txt   # only needed once
make -C docs/ html SPHINXOPTS="-W"
```

To force update of the API documentation, precede the `make` command with:

```shell
python3 docs/autogen_api.py
```

Similarly, to force-update the configuration, run:

```shell
python3 docs/autogen_config.py
```

The IPython licensing terms
===========================

IPython is licensed under the terms of the Modified BSD License (also known as New or Revised or 3-Clause BSD). See the LICENSE file.

About the IPython Development Team
----------------------------------

Fernando Perez began IPython in 2001 based on code from Janko Hauser \<<jhauser@zscout.de>\> and Nathaniel Gray \<<n8gray@caltech.edu>\>. Fernando is still the project lead.

The IPython Development Team is the set of all contributors to the IPython project. This includes all of the IPython subprojects.

The core team that coordinates development on GitHub can be found here: <https://github.com/ipython/>.

Our Copyright Policy
--------------------

IPython uses a shared copyright model. Each contributor maintains copyright over their contributions to IPython. But, it is important to note that these contributions are typically only changes to the repositories. Thus, the IPython source code, in its entirety is not the copyright of any single person or institution. Instead, it is the collective copyright of the entire IPython Development Team. If individual contributors want to maintain a record of what changes/contributions they have specific copyright on, they should indicate their copyright in the commit message of the change, when they commit the change to one of the IPython repositories.

With this in mind, the following banner should be used in any source code file to indicate the copyright and license terms:

    # Copyright (c) IPython Development Team.
    # Distributed under the terms of the Modified BSD License.

IPython: Productive Interactive Computing
=========================================

Overview
--------

Welcome to IPython. Our full documentation is available on [ipython.readthedocs.io](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and contains information on how to install, use, and contribute to the project. IPython (Interactive Python) is a command shell for interactive computing in multiple programming languages, originally developed for the Python programming language, that offers introspection, rich media, shell syntax, tab completion, and history.

**IPython versions and Python Support**

Starting after IPython 8.16, we will progressively transition to [Spec-0000](https://scientific-python.org/specs/spec-0000/).

Starting with IPython 7.10, IPython follows [NEP 29](https://numpy.org/neps/nep-0029-deprecation_policy.html)

**IPython 7.17+** requires Python version 3.7 and above.

**IPython 7.10+** requires Python version 3.6 and above.

**IPython 7.0** requires Python version 3.5 and above.

**IPython 6.x** requires Python version 3.3 and above.

**IPython 5.x LTS** is the compatible release for Python 2.7. If you require Python 2 support, you **must** use IPython 5.x LTS. Please update your project configurations and requirements as necessary.

The Notebook, Qt console and a number of other pieces are now parts of *Jupyter*. See the [Jupyter installation docs](https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html) if you want to use these.

Main features of IPython
------------------------

Comprehensive object introspection.

Input history, persistent across sessions.

Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.

Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.

Extensible system of 'magic' commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related to IPython or the operating system.

A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing \$PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).

Session logging and reloading.

Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.

Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.

Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.

Integrated access to the pdb debugger and the Python profiler.

Development and Instant running
-------------------------------

You can find the latest version of the development documentation on [readthedocs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

You can run IPython from this directory without even installing it system-wide by typing at the terminal:

    $ python -m IPython

Or see the [development installation docs](https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install/install.html#installing-the-development-version) for the latest revision on read the docs.

Documentation and installation instructions for older version of IPython can be found on the [IPython website](https://ipython.org/documentation.html)

Alternatives to IPython
-----------------------

IPython may not be to your taste; if that\'s the case there might be similar project that you might want to use:

-   The classic Python REPL.
-   [bpython](https://bpython-interpreter.org/)
-   [mypython](https://www.asmeurer.com/mypython/)
-   [ptpython and ptipython](https://pypi.org/project/ptpython/)
-   [Xonsh](https://xon.sh/)

Ignoring commits with git blame.ignoreRevsFile
----------------------------------------------

As of git 2.23, it is possible to make formatting changes without breaking `git blame`. See the [git documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config#Documentation/git-config.txt-blameignoreRevsFile) for more details.

To use this feature you must:

-   Install git \>= 2.23

-   

    Configure your local git repo by running:

    :   -   POSIX: `tools\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.sh`
        -   Windows: `tools\configure-git-blame-ignore-revs.bat`

The enhanced interactive Python shells have the following main features:

> -   Comprehensive object introspection.
> -   Input history, persistent across sessions.
> -   Caching of output results during a session with automatically generated references.
> -   Extensible tab completion, with support by default for completion of python variables and keywords, filenames and function keywords.
> -   Extensible system of \'magic\' commands for controlling the environment and performing many tasks related either to IPython or the operating system.
> -   A rich configuration system with easy switching between different setups (simpler than changing \$PYTHONSTARTUP environment variables every time).
> -   Session logging and reloading.
> -   Extensible syntax processing for special purpose situations.
> -   Access to the system shell with user-extensible alias system.
> -   Easily embeddable in other Python programs and GUIs.
